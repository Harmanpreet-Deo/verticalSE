This Global Climate Litigation Report: 2023 Status Review shows that people are increasingly turning to the courts to combat the climate crisis. As of December 2022, there have been 2,180 climate-related cases filed in 65 jurisdictions, including international and regional courts, tribunals, quasi-judicial bodies, or other adjudicatory bodies, such as Special Procedures at the United Nations and arbitration tribunals. This represents a steady increase from 884 cases in 2017 and 1,550 cases in 2020. Children and youth, women’s groups, local communities, and Indigenous Peoples, among others, are taking a prominent role in bringing these cases and driving climate change governance reform in more and more countries around the world. This report, which updates previous United Nations Environment Programme reports published in 2017 and 2020, provides an overview of the current state of climate change litigation and an update on global climate change litigation trends. It provides judges, lawyers, advocates, policymakers, researchers, environmental defenders, climate activists, human rights activists (including women’s rights activists), NGOs, businesses and the international community at large with an essential resource to understand the current state of global climate litigation, including descriptions of the key issues that courts have faced in the course of climate change cases. This report further demonstrates the importance of an environmental rule of law in combating the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Access to justice enables the protection of environmental law and human rights and promotes accountability in public institutions. The report was launched in conjunction with the anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly’s recognition of the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment (A/RES/76/300), as the majority of cases brought before the courts demonstrate concrete links between human rights and climate change.

        "content": "In 2023, temperature records toppled, while storms, floods, droughts and heatwaves caused devastation. finds that progress on climate adaptation is slowing when it should be accelerating to catch up with these rising climate change impacts. The report – which looks at progress in planning, financing and implementing adaptation actions – finds that the adaptation finance needs of developing countries are 10-18 times as big as international public finance flows. This is over 50 per cent higher than the previous range estimate. The modelled costs of adaptation in developing countries are estimated at US$215 billion per year this decade. The adaptation finance needed to implement domestic adaptation priorities is estimated at US$387 billion per year. Despite these needs, public multilateral and bilateral adaptation finance flows to developing countries declined by 15 per cent to US$21 billion in 2021. As a result of the growing adaptation finance needs and faltering flows, the current adaptation finance gap is now estimated at US$194-366 billion per year. At the same time, adaptation planning and implementation appear to be plateauing. This failure to adapt has massive implications for losses and damages, particularly for the most vulnerable. This report identifies seven ways to increase financing, including through domestic expenditure and international and private sector finance. Additional avenues include remittances, increasing and tailoring finance to Small and Medium Enterprises and a reform of the global financial architecture. The new Loss and Damage fund will also need to move towards more innovative financing mechanisms to reach the necessary scale of investment. Underfinanced, Underprepared. The adaptation finance needed to implement domestic adaptation priorities is estimated at US$387 billion per year. This report identifies seven ways to increase financing, including through domestic expenditure and international and private sector finance. The need for adaptation is urgently growing as the climate crisis unfolds and worsens. To accompany the launch of the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) , listen to this collection of 11 case studies which spotlight the challenges facing humanity and the adaptation solutions that can help address the problem. Progress on climate adaptation is slowing on all fronts when it should be accelerating to catch up with rising climate change impacts and risks, according to a new United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report. © 2024 UNEP"

        "content": "As greenhouse gas emissions hit new highs, temperature records tumble and climate impacts intensify, the finds that the world is heading for a temperature rise far above the Paris Agreement goals unless countries deliver more than they have promised. The report is the 14 edition in a series that brings together many of the world’s top climate scientists to look at future trends in greenhouse gas emissions and provide potential solutions to the challenge of global warming. The report finds that there has been progress since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. Greenhouse gas emissions in 2030, based on policies in place, were projected to increase by 16 per cent at the time of the agreement’s adoption. Today, the projected increase is 3 per cent. However, predicted 2030 greenhouse gas emissions still must fall by 28 per cent for the Paris Agreement 2°C pathway and 42 per cent for the 1.5°C pathway. As things stand, fully implementing unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) made under the Paris Agreement would put the world on track for limiting temperature rise to 2.9°C above pre-industrial levels this century. Fully implementing conditional NDCs would lower this to 2.5°C. The EGR report calls for all nations to accelerate economy-wide, low-carbon development transformations. Countries with greater capacity and responsibility for emissions will need to take more ambitious action and support developing nations as they pursue low-emissions development growth. The report looks at how stronger implementation can increase the chances of the next round of NDCs, due in 2025, bringing down greenhouse gas emissions in 2035 to levels consistent with 2°C and 1.5°C pathways. It also looks at the potential and risks of Carbon Dioxide Removal methods – such as nature-based solutions and direct air carbon capture and storage. The Emissions Gap Report is UNEP's spotlight report launched annually in advance of the annual Climate negotiations. The EGR tracks the gap between where global emissions are heading with current country commitments and where they ought to be to limit warming to 1.5°C. Each edition explores ways to bridge the emissions gap. The world is witnessing a disturbing acceleration in the number, speed and scale of broken climate records. At the time of writing, 86 days have been recorded with temperatures exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels this year. Humanity is breaking all the wrong records on climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions and the global average temperature are hitting new highs, while extreme weather events are occurring more often, developing faster and becoming more intense. © 2024 UNEP"

Without profound changes to these sectors and a drastic cut to carbon footprints, there is little hope of protecting the planet from the devastating effects of a warmer world. This live feed will keep you up-to-date with all the latest news from the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as the to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan. In what is probably an overlooked section of the draft texts released earlier today, the decision on who will host COP31 in 2026 won't be decided until June next year at the earliest. Both Turkey and Australia - co-hosting with one or more Pacific island nations - want to host the event, but neither is willing to withdraw their candidacy. Of the 29 COPs, six have been held in the southern hemisphere and 23 in the northern hemisphere. The new draft texts have just been released by , and the key takeaway is that developing countries should receive US$250 billion per year by 2035 for climate action. This is to come from \"a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources.\" While it also \"calls for a finance target of US$1.3 trillion by 2035, it also \"invites developing countries to make additional contributions\". These figures will see lots of back and forth over the rest of the day, but at least there are figures to work with now. How developing countries will react to this text remains to be seen however. Hundreds of scientists from around the world are in the midst of drafting a landmark report to help government leaders and other decision makers counter some of the world’s most acute environmental ills. The , will provide a comprehensive overview of the latest environmental research and provide decision makers with a roadmap for addressing the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss including desertification and pollution and waste. The European Union released its first (BTR) this morning, highlighting the importance of transparency in achieving the Paris Agreement goals. The EU’s BTR revealed a 37 per cent drop in net greenhouse gas emissions since 1990, with a potential pathway to a 90 per cent net greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2040. Transparency is a key component of the Paris Agreement. Countries submit their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - their plans on how they will reduce emissions – every five years, with the next round of NDCs due in February 2025. As part of this, most countries are expected to submit their first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) this month. BTRs are progress reports that provide information on national emissions levels and mitigation efforts as well as adaptation measures. They provide a snapshot of progress in achieving the NDCs goals. For more information on why transparency matters, check out this handy video: Talks are still deadlocked in Baku on a number of issues, particularly climate finance – with disagreement about how much developing countries should receive annually by 2030 and where that money should come from. Developing countries want US$1.3 trillion a year, but the draft text released yesterday had just an “X” where a figure should be, illustrating how far apart negotiators are. The EU has said it wants more money to come from the private sector, while developing countries want the money to come in the form of grants, not loans. About 80 of the most vulnerable countries represented by ministers from the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean yesterday. It included a proposal to finalise a deal on grant-based public money and agree on roadmap to COP29 in Brazil on which sources could bridge the gap to $1.3 trillion. They said redirecting and other sources of public finance towards climate action could be a solution, as could levies on aviation and shipping as well as taxes on wealth and major polluters. The COP29 Presidency has said it will aim to release a new draft of texts later today with a view to sending out the final text later this evening, although no one in Baku is expecting COP29 to finish this evening. Nature-based Solutions are key to solving the interlinked crises we now face. That was the message from UNEP’s Executive Director, Inger Andersen at . She highlighted how Nature-based Solutions help to: “Cut greenhouse gas emissions and increase adaptation to climate impacts under the Paris Agreement. That halt and reverse biodiversity loss under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. That meet land degradation neutrality goals under the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. That deliver on the SDGs and more.” Andersen also highlighted how these solutions are not just good for the climate, for nature and for people, but also good for business. “Much of the global economy is dependent on nature and its services. UNEP recognizes this by supporting Nature-based Solutions and Ecosystem-based Adaptation through nearly 90 global projects, restoring 324,000 hectares and benefiting 3.5 million people.” It’s the (most likely) final day in Baku, with negotiations coming down the wire. The hope is that the multiple gaps between countries can be bridged, and a final text is released that enables countries most vulnerable to climate change to transition to a sustainable future and protect themselves from the effects of climate change. Yesterday the COP Presidency announced that the revised presidency texts would be released late on Friday. We will keep you posted on developments as they happen. Narrated by Don Cheadle, learn about and the leaders, activists and entrepreneurs building scalable climate solutions across the world. Every fraction of a degree matters, every climate action counts. There have been calls for the world not to go backwards on cutting emissions after some countries expressed dismay that the draft text released earlier today was not strong enough on emissions cuts - which are necessary if the world is to avoid devastating climate chaos. , which includes Costa Rica, France, Greenland, the Marshall Islands and other nations, released a statement on Thursday calling for nations to stick to their 2023 pledge to begin the transition away from fossil fuels. At least year's COP28 in Dubai, countries agreed to \"transition away from fossil fuels\" but that line was missing from the draft text released earlier today in Baku. Colombian Environment Minister, Susana Muhamed pointed out the necessity of such a transition: \"What is the point of having an agreement and a convention if we cannot deal with the issue that creates the problem,” she asked. This was echoed by Ed Miliband, the UK minister for energy security and net zero, who said that in a world facing increasing disasters, “standing still is a retreat”. Duong Khanh Ly, the founder of a tea cooperative in northeast Viet Nam, had a problem. Severe downpours would often soak tea leaves that had been left outside to dry, spoiling entire batches and cutting into the profits of the co-operative’s 15 female members. So, Duong approached CHIASE, a non-governmental organization and partner of the United Nations’ programme, which helps women become more resilient in the face of climate change. Launched in 2018, EmPower is led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and UN Women. The effort is designed to tackle a problem many women face across the Asia-Pacific region: a lack of access to credit. © 2024 UNEP"

        "title": "Methane emissions tracking system proves its worth, but action to plug leaks must accelerate",
        "meta_description": "A high-tech system that identifies major methane leaks has delivered 1,200 notifications to governments and companies over the last two years, yet just one per cent of notifications were responded to according to new UN Environment Programme (UNEP) data.",
        "content": "– A high-tech system that identifies major methane leaks has delivered 1,200 notifications to governments and companies over the last two years, yet just one per cent of notifications were responded to according to new UN Environment Programme (UNEP) data. Despite commitments under the Global Methane Pledge to slash emissions 30 per cent by 2030, highlights that methane plume alerts from the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS), part of UNEP’s International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO), represent an untapped opportunity for immediate climate action. Atmospheric methane is the second biggest driver of anthropogenic global warming after carbon dioxide (CO ) and is over 80 times more powerful than CO in the near-term. Global methane emissions must be reduced 40-45 per cent by 2030 to achieve cost-effective pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C. Yet shows atmospheric concentrations of methane rising at record speed over the past 5 years. “To have any chance of getting global warming under control, methane emissions must come down, and come down fast,” said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director. “We now have a proven system to identify major leaks so they can be quickly stopped – often with simple repairs. We are quite literally talking about screwing bolts tighter in some cases. “Governments and oil and gas companies must stop paying lip-service to this challenge when answers are staring them in the face. Instead, they should recognise the significant opportunity this presents and start responding to alerts by plugging leaks that are spewing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere. The tools are ready, the targets are set – now it is time to act.” While methane responses must rapidly grow, there are examples of nations and companies responding – proving the value of data-driven solutions like MARS. In 2024, IMEO verified action to reduce emissions from major leaks in Azerbaijan and the United States. In Algeria and Nigeria MARS notifications and engagement led to direct action from the governments and oil and gas companies to address large methane leaks. In the Algerian case, which saw methane leaks take place for years, the annual avoided emissions are equivalent to 500,000 cars being taken off the road. In Nigeria case, the six-month leak emitted methane equivalent to 400,000 cars being driven for a year and was able to be fixed in under two weeks by simply replacing faulty equipment. Beyond addressing major emissions seen from space, the systems exist for industry to manage its methane footprint. UNEP’s (OGMP 2.0), an initiative for oil and gas companies to measure and reduce their methane emissions. OGMP 2.0 added 20 members over the past year, growing to 140 members covering more than 40 per cent of global production. 2024 is the first year that OGMP 2.0 began awarding its “Gold Standard reporting” to companies that report their emissions at the highest data quality levels. So far in 2024, 55 companies have achieved Gold Standard reporting. Moving all companies across the sector to OGMP 2.0 Gold Standard emissions reporting is necessary to effectively target mitigation with measurement-based data and track performance against pledges to reduce emissions, such as the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter announced at COP28. IMEO has also launched the to spark further action. The platform delivers open, reliable and actionable global methane emissions data to drive impactful methane mitigation action by governments and companies, while providing transparent, reliable data to civil society and media. IMEO is also stepping up its work on methane emissions from other sources with a new Steel Methane Programme. Methane emissions from metallurgical coal used in steel production represent on average 30 per cent of steel’s near-term climate footprint. These emissions can be mitigated at roughly one per cent of the price of steel. The new programme provides a framework for reducing the climate footprint of the steel sector as the industry transitions to green alternatives. MARS is being expanded to cover metallurgical coal production and identify further mitigation opportunities. : : \"Methane emissions are a powerful driver of climate change, and the EU is determined to cut down these emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. Credible data is essential to achieve the goals of the Global Methane Pledge. As importing markets, like the EU, increasingly demand cleaner fuels and transparency on emissions, UNEP’s IMEO is delivering data that enables informed decision-making and drives accountability. I therefore welcome the comprehensive report that is launched today.” Methane is a very aggressive greenhouse gas. However, it has one advantage: it is much easier to reduce than CO2. We have to use these low-hanging fruits. As we work towards our ambitious climate goals, we need every tool available to mitigate methane emissions effectively. UNEP’s IMEO is delivering precise, data-driven insights to enable swift action. Germany is committed to supporting these innovative measures, which demonstrate that with the right data, we can achieve substantial reductions and drive global climate progress. It is now up to the polluters to avoid methane slip as far as possible. The techniques for this are available. This is more than indicated in view of the ongoing global climate change.\" : \"For Nigeria, acting on methane emissions is not just about climate responsibility, but also about local health and sustainable development. Nigeria is proud to partner with UNEP’s IMEO and the European Commission on scientific research to measure emissions across sectors and enable methane action in Nigeria. We are committed to using these insights to further our emissions reduction goals and fulfill our commitment as a Global Methane Pledge Champion.\" : \"The data and transparency UNEP’s IMEO provides are invaluable for accountability and action. The Global Methane Hub supports this initiative, recognizing the critical role of reliable data in turning pledges into emission reductions. We need to scale these efforts to bring integrity and independent verification of mitigation claims.\" UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment. It provides leadership and encourages partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations. , UN Environment Programme © 2024 UNEP"

        "meta_description": "Kenyan boarding schools are embracing energy efficiency through a new project supported by UNEP.",
        "content": "Shelton Nyakundi, an 18-year-old student at the Menengai boarding school in Nakuru, Kenya, believes one simple thing could make the difference between the academic success and failure of many pupils: light. Nyakundi says to save money, his school switches off its inefficient incandescent lights at 10 p.m. depriving students of valuable studying time. “Right now, lack of light is a limiting factor, both in the evenings and in the mornings,” says Nyakundi, who wants to work in healthcare when he graduates. The is supporting a pilot project aiming to brighten the future of Nyakundi and his classmates. The effort is outfitting with low-cost, energy-efficient light-emitting-diodes or LED lighting, which will allow school administrators to save money and keep lights on longer. The project is a collaboration with , a UN-hosted initiative, and Kenya’s Ministry of Education. It is part of by Kenya to improve energy efficiency, which is a key component of the country’s plans to expand access to affordable renewable power. “Energy efficiency is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to improve living standards and counter climate change globally and it does not require fundamental changes to existing energy systems,” says John Christensen, Director of the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre. Data from the International Energy Agency suggests that energy efficiency globally could deliver of the emissions cuts necessary to meet the goals of the on climate change, which aims to keep global warming well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. At COP28 Dubai last year, to double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements every year until 2030. UNEP’s also highlighted the need for countries to outline in their Nationally Determined Contributions how they plan to achieve these energy efficiency improvements. Embracing energy efficiency – and LED lights in particular – could pay big dividends in countries struggling to power their schools. Globally, 25 per cent of primary schools and about 15 per cent of secondary schools lack access to electricity, affecting 186 million children, . Even in schools with electricity, inefficient lighting means many struggle to afford electricity bills, resulting in outages. Lighting is responsible for about half of electricity consumption in Kenya’s schools, according to by the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre. That is largely due to a reliance on incandescent bulbs, which have a filament that is heated until it glows, and fluorescent lighting, which generates gas from atomic collisions. Both those processes are inefficient compared to LED lighting, which passes an electrical current through a microchip, illuminating tiny light sources. In Kenyan schools, LEDs are freeing up resources that can be reinvested in other needs, such as schoolbooks, sports equipment, and teacher training. Menegai High School’s principal, John Ngunyi, said the switch to LEDs, which began in September, will benefit more than 2500 students. “The LED system will increase the amount of time that the students have for studying and the amount of time that they can have the lights on,” he says. The LED bulbs are provided by the , a charity arm of Signify, a global lighting manufacturer. Eric Otenio, Signify’s Program Manager for Sub-Saharan Africa, highlights that LED bulbs are much easier on students’ eyes. “They reduce flickering and therefore eyestrain and headaches,” he says. He also points out that LED bulbs need to be replaced much less frequently than fluorescent bulbs, thereby reducing waste. As school principal Ngunyi points out, it is not just the students who will benefit from the new lighting system: “[In the past] we limited the lights for the cooks and the watchmen, telling them not to put the lights on until a certain time.” Once the new LED lights are installed, Ngunyi says he won’t worry about the school’s month-end electricity bill. The LED lighting pilot project will be completed by the end of 2024 and will see more than 10,000 traditional fluorescent lamps replaced. That is expected to result in savings of more than US$213,000 a year across the 100 schools, a reduction in their current power bills. It will save power equivalent to the release of 460,000kg of carbon dioxide annually. “This is a win-win for schools,” says Christensen. “And it highlights the huge impact something relatively simple to implement can have on the lives of students.” © 2024 UNEP"

        "content": "Hundreds of scientists from around the world are in the midst of drafting a landmark report to help government leaders and other decision makers counter some of the world’s most acute environmental ills. The , will provide a comprehensive overview of the latest environmental research and provide decision makers with a roadmap for addressing the triple planetary crisis of , and . The report is being prepared under the stewardship of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The (UNEA), the world’s top decision-making body on the environment, the seventh edition in 2022. UNEP subsequently established the , which includes 25 experts from Member States and 10 representatives from major groups and stakeholders to guide the report’s creation. UNEP will publish GEO-7 at UNEA-7 in December 2025. To learn more about how governments will inform and benefit from GEO-7, UNEP spoke with Edgar Gutierrez-Espeleta, a co-chair of the report and former Minister for Environment and Energy of Costa Rica from 2014 to 2018. : GEO is an assessment of the latest science. We use all the reports that are already out there, and we review everything so policymakers can see the problem and be motivated to take the action needed. GEO-7 will mark, as we say in Spanish, (a before and after). From GEO-7, we're going to start looking at things differently. We are trying to bring a synergistic view to the equation, not a siloed view, so that we can develop solutions to put on the table for decision makers. Its 21 chapters cover basically everything about the state of the environment. : GEO-7 is very focused on solutions. We're providing readers not only solutions pathways, but also outlooks. One focus is what will happen in years 2050 and 2100 if we follow the current business-as-usual scenario. That is very useful for decision makers to realize how important it is to act now to change the direction where we are headed. Environmental issues are no longer just environment issues. They affect the economy, social security, housing, agriculture, transport, the health sector – everything. GEO-7 makes those connections, providing insights into how, when we end environmental degradation, we can tackle other issues as well. : It is very important. The Intergovernmental and Multi-stakeholder Advisory Group approves the way forward, outlining the budget, approach and scope. The body has already provided feedback about the report’s scope and how to manage problems. We maintain very close contact with Member States and every time the authors for GEO-7 meet, we also have a meeting with this body. : Member States have provided names of scientists who can parts of the report. This is a process that is engaging more than 300 scientists around the world, but the more scientists are engaged, the better the report will be. There are plenty of possibilities for people to engage, like writing, reviewing and editing. It is also very important for scientists from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Eastern Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean to bring their knowledge, inputs and views so that we can enrich GEO-7. : We're already producing the second draft, which is going to include an executive summary that will be appealing to policymakers. We have executive summaries for each chapter, and we are producing a summary aimed solely at decision makers. : GEO has prompted a lot of integrated environmental assessments at the . But with GEO-7, we are expecting to go beyond that. For example, social media plays an important role. There is a team thinking about how we are going to reach new audiences, how we are going to disseminate this to different segments of the population – youth, universities and policymakers. This is an important part of GEO-7. : I will be very, very happy if GEO-7 can influence policymaking decisions at all levels and move ministers of environment, finance, industry, agriculture and more to stop environmental degradation. We have to realize that if we keep on doing business as usual, we are not going to have enough land to produce food to eat in . Once you are in politics, you are not always worrying about what is going to happen in 2050. Instead, you’re worried about what's happening in the next three years because then elections come, and you need votes. But that sort of vision is taking us closer to the abyss. We need to think in the long term, and we need to be brave enough to take action. I think GEO-7 will contribute to this if it is read properly. © 2024 UNEP"

The report describes the opportunities offered by limiting emissions of the so-called short-lived climate pollutants. Reductions of these pollutants will limit the rate of short-term warming, and when sustained and combined with reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, they help to limit long-term warming, which is the ultimate aim of closing the emissions gap.

The science clearly shows that reconnecting with our ancient habitats, be it by walking in forests or plunging into cool lakes, produces mood-boosting endorphins. Being in nature is good for our mental health because it feels like a homecoming. So, humanity undoubtedly is biodiversity, part of a complex web of interdependent species that has evolved over billions of years. And in a closed system such as Earth, what goes around comes around. Two viruses have spilled over to humans per year for a century, most devastatingly in the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate change could lead to 250,000 extra deaths each year from 2030-2050. Antimicrobial resistance, strongly linked to environmental pathways, is currently predicted to claim 39 million lives between 2025-2050. When we harm biodiversity, we harm ourselves. Humanity is at least finally learning. The acknowledges that the health of humans, animals, plants and the wider environment are bound together. calls for the One Health approach to be integrated into National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans. And, of course, the Global Action Plan on Biodiversity and Health is on the agenda of this . We must adopt this action plan and implement it with a holistic, systemic approach that unifies action across health, environment, finance, industry and agriculture. One Health means One Society and One Economy. Everything is connected. At the forefront of efforts should be Indigenous Peoples, who never forgot that humanity is part of nature, not above it. Indigenous peoples could help to solve many of the problems we face, if only we would make space for them to lead – which is why it is so powerful that Colombia has made advancing traditional knowledge a priority at COP16. Our health cannot be separated from the health of the planet and its many species. So, I call on leaders to adopt and implement the global action plan. Listen to traditional knowledge. Integrate biodiversity and health considerations into all sectors and aspects of development. And ensure that biodiversity is conserved and restored for the health and resilience of all species, not just our own. © 2024 UNEP"

        "content": ": Un système de haute technologie qui identifie les principales fuites de méthane a envoyé 1 200 notifications aux gouvernements et aux entreprises au cours des deux dernières années, mais seulement 1 % des notifications ont été traitées, selon les nouvelles données du Programme des Nations Unies pour l'environnement (PNUE). Malgré les engagements pris dans le cadre du Pacte mondial sur le méthane de réduire les émissions de 30 % d'ici 2030, ( Un œil sur le méthane :rapport 2024 de l’observatoire international des émissions de méthane) souligne que les alertes au panache de méthane émises par le système d'alerte et de réaction au méthane (MARS), qui fait partie de l'Observatoire international des émissions de méthane (IMEO) du PNUE, représentent une occasion inexploitée d'agir immédiatement en faveur du climat. Le méthane atmosphérique est le deuxième facteur de réchauffement climatique d'origine anthropique après le dioxyde de carbone ( ) et il est plus de 80 fois plus puissant que le à court terme. Les émissions mondiales de méthane doivent être réduites de 40 à 45 % d'ici à 2030 si l'on veut trouver des solutions rentables permettant de limiter le réchauffement de la planète à 1,5 °C. Or, montrent que les concentrations atmosphériques de méthane ont augmenté à une vitesse record au cours des cinq dernières années. « Pour avoir une chance de maîtriser le réchauffement de la planète, les émissions de méthane doivent diminuer, et diminuer rapidement », a déclaré Inger Andersen, Directrice exécutive du PNUE. « Nous disposons désormais d'un système éprouvé pour identifier les fuites majeures afin de pouvoir les arrêter rapidement, souvent par de simples réparations. Dans certains cas, il s'agit littéralement de resserrer les boulons. « Les gouvernements et les compagnies pétrolières et gazières doivent cesser de relever ce défi du bout des lèvres, alors que les réponses leur sautent aux yeux. Ils doivent au contraire reconnaître l'opportunité considérable que cela représente et commencer à répondre aux alertes en colmatant les fuites qui rejettent dans l'atmosphère du méthane qui réchauffe le climat. Les outils sont prêts, les objectifs sont fixés - il est maintenant temps d'agir. Alors que les mesures de lutte contre le méthane doivent rapidement se développer, il existe des exemples de pays et d'entreprises qui réagissent, prouvant ainsi la valeur des solutions basées sur les données telles que MARS. En 2024, l'IMEO a vérifié les mesures prises pour réduire les émissions dues à des fuites importantes en Azerbaïdjan et aux États-Unis. En Algérie et au Nigeria, les notifications et l'engagement de MARS ont conduit les gouvernements et les compagnies pétrolières et gazières à prendre des mesures directes pour lutter contre les grandes fuites de méthane. Dans le cas de l'Algérie, où des fuites de méthane ont eu lieu pendant des années, les émissions annuelles évitées sont équivalentes à 500 000 voitures retirées de la circulation. Dans le cas du Nigeria, la fuite, qui a duré six mois, a émis du méthane équivalant à la circulation de 400 000 voitures pendant un an et a pu être réparée en moins de deux semaines en remplaçant simplement l'équipement défectueux. Au-delà des émissions majeures observées depuis l'espace, il existe des systèmes permettant à l'industrie de gérer son empreinte en matière de méthane. Le (OGMP 2.0) du PNUE est une initiative permettant aux compagnies pétrolières et gazières de mesurer et de réduire leurs émissions de méthane. L'OGMP 2.0 a accueilli 20 nouveaux membres au cours de l'année écoulée, pour atteindre 140 membres couvrant plus de 40 % de la production mondiale. L'IMEO a également lancé la afin de susciter de nouvelles actions. Cette plateforme fournit des données ouvertes, fiables et exploitables sur les émissions de méthane au niveau mondial afin d'inciter les gouvernements et les entreprises à prendre des mesures efficaces de réduction des émissions de méthane, tout en fournissant des données transparentes et fiables à la société civile et aux médias. L'IMEO intensifie également ses travaux sur les émissions de méthane provenant d'autres sources en lançant un nouveau programme sur le méthane dans l'acier. Les émissions de méthane provenant du charbon métallurgique utilisé dans la production d'acier représentent en moyenne 30 % de l'empreinte climatique à court terme de l'acier. Ces émissions peuvent être réduites pour environ un pour cent du prix de l'acier. Le nouveau programme fournit un cadre pour la réduction de l'empreinte climatique du secteur de l'acier à mesure que l'industrie se tourne vers des solutions vertes. Le programme MARS est en cours d'extension pour couvrir la production de charbon métallurgique et identifier d'autres possibilités d'atténuation. : « Les émissions de méthane sont un puissant moteur du changement climatique, et l'UE est déterminée à réduire ces émissions de 30 % d'ici à 2030. Des données crédibles sont essentielles pour atteindre les objectifs du Pacte mondial sur le méthane. Alors que les marchés importateurs, comme l'UE, exigent de plus en plus de carburants plus propres et de transparence sur les émissions, l'IMEO du PNUE fournit des données qui permettent de prendre des décisions en connaissance de cause et de rendre des comptes. Je me réjouis donc du rapport complet qui est présenté aujourd'hui ». Le méthane est un gaz à effet de serre très agressif. Il présente toutefois un avantage : il est beaucoup plus facile à réduire que le CO2. Nous devons utiliser ces fruits à portée de main. Alors que nous nous efforçons d'atteindre nos objectifs climatiques ambitieux, nous avons besoin de tous les outils disponibles pour atténuer efficacement les émissions de méthane. L'IMEO du PNUE fournit des informations précises et fondées sur des données afin de permettre une action rapide. L'Allemagne s'est engagée à soutenir ces mesures innovantes, qui démontrent qu'avec les bonnes données, nous pouvons parvenir à des réductions substantielles et faire progresser le climat mondial. Il appartient désormais aux pollueurs d'éviter autant que possible les rejets de méthane. Les techniques pour ce faire sont disponibles. C'est plus qu'indiqué compte tenu du changement climatique mondial en cours ». : « Pour le Nigeria, agir sur les émissions de méthane n'est pas seulement une question de responsabilité climatique, mais aussi de santé locale et de développement durable. Le Nigeria est fier de s'associer à l'IMEO du PNUE et à la Commission européenne dans le cadre d'une recherche scientifique visant à mesurer les émissions dans tous les secteurs et à permettre une action sur le méthane au Nigeria. Nous nous engageons à utiliser ces connaissances pour atteindre nos objectifs de réduction des émissions et remplir notre engagement en tant que champion du Pacte mondial sur le méthane ». : « Les données et la transparence fournies par l'IMEO du PNUE sont inestimables pour la responsabilité et l'action. Le Hub mondial du méthane soutient cette initiative, reconnaissant le rôle essentiel de données fiables pour transformer les engagements en réductions d'émissions. Nous devons intensifier ces efforts afin d'assurer l'intégrité et la vérification indépendante des déclarations d'atténuation.

        "meta_description": "The 8th World One Health Congress – one of the world’s largest forums dedicated to advancing One Health science and policy - kicks off in Cape Town, South Africa.",
        "content": "How do you make the people of the world healthier? For the longest time, the answer was to treat the myriad ailments that plague the human race. But in recent years, experts have come to have a more expansive view of health. Many are finally acknowledging that human health is inextricably linked to the health of animals, both wild and domestic, and the health of the planet. This philosophy is embodied in what is known as the approach. It posits that people can’t be healthy if they are drinking polluted water or living side-by-side with disease carrying livestock, and calls for holistic solutions that make people, animals and the planet better off. “The environment is an essential pillar of the One Health approach,” says Doreen Lynn Robinson, Director of Biodiversity and Land at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) “Tackling the triple planetary crisis of , , and will help foster a sustainable future where people, animals and the planet can thrive together,” she says. From 20 – 23 September, scientists, policymakers, representatives of international institutions, civil society and the private sector will gather in Cape Town, South Africa for dedicated to advancing the One Health approach. The meeting comes ahead of the 16 Conference of the Parties to the Convention of Biological Diversity in Cali, Colombia. At this key October global gathering, countries are expected to adopt an international plan designed to bolster biodiversity and improve human health. Ahead of those gatherings, we sat down with UNEP’s Robinson to discuss the central role that the environment plays in achieving the long-term goals of One Health. One Health is based on the principle that you cannot have healthy people in an unhealthy environment and that the health of humans, animals and ecosystems are deeply intertwined. Addressing one aspect without considering the others will only lead to incomplete or unsustainable solutions. : One Health has traditionally been concerned mostly with public and animal health. That has sometimes come at the cost of understanding how biodiversity loss, pollution and climate change can exacerbate health risks, including the spread of antimicrobial resistance and diseases such as , and . At the same time, the environment is the source of health solutions, as it provides the ecosystem services to offer clean water and air, nutrient rich and diverse diets and medicines. The Cape Town congress will explore these links. There will be that examines how intensive livestock rearing has fostered the spread of zoonotic diseases through pathogens that jump between animals and humans. Also on the agenda will be a session on how the overuse of antibiotics is feeding the rise of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics. As well, the gathering will look at how to better integrate the viewpoints of women, youth and into the One Health approach. We know that healthy ecosystems act as natural buffers between wildlife, livestock and humans, and can reduce the chances that diseases will jump between the three groups. Unfortunately, industrial agriculture, deforestation and other human activities are shrinking natural spaces. This changes many factors tied to disease risk, including potentially driving up risks from those pathogens capable of causing a pandemic. UNEP is the world’s leading authority on the environment, and we have spent more than five decades working to conserve, restore and sustainably use ecosystems. We’re bringing that experience to the , and helping countries and communities around the world rebuild their natural defense against many health threats, from disease to malnutrition to respiratory and water-borne illnesses. Implementing the GBF by promoting healthy ecosystems, means unpolluted water, breathable air, non-toxic food, better management of interactions between humans and wild animals to avoid spread of disease, strengthened traditional knowledge for medicines and well-being and many other things. One Health can contribute to achieving the by fostering collaboration across sectors to find solutions that achieve real co-benefits. One Health practitioners can jointly manage medical waste much better, including chemicals and plastics, so that it doesn’t wind up in our rivers and oceans. They can change farming and land use practices to reduce land degradation and halt the conversion of healthy ecosystems which are currently eating away at the very foundation for life on earth for all of us. The Biodiversity and Health Action Plan is essentially a bridge that connects the environment and human health. It will include recommendations designed to help countries bolster their biodiversity, including by protecting and restoring natural spaces, while at the same time, improving the health of people. It encourages governments to take a holistic view when making policy, including, for example, linking national health strategies with national plans to protect biodiversity. The one health approach will be important for implementation of this plan and so it is essential that parties adopt the plan at the COP. We need all hands on deck. Governments must incorporate One Health principles into national policies, including through creating regulations that address the interconnection between human health, animal health and ecosystems. We need financial investments in One Health that go well beyond a disease only focus, including funding for research and the implementation of on-the-ground projects. We need to build skills and capacities of human and animal health professionals and environmental practitioners on the One Health approach, so they can deliver critical integrated solutions in communities around the world. This is especially the case in developing countries where the necessary financial resources and capacity are comparatively limited. And we need to raise awareness about One Health, and particularly the environmental aspects, among the public. Yes. Progress has already been made in a lot of these areas. But there’s no doubt we need to ramp up these efforts if we’re going to create a healthier future for all living things on this planet. © 2024 UNEP"

        "meta_description": "Greater transparency in environmental pledges is needed to combat the climate crisis, experts say.",
        "content": "To meaningfully address the mounting impacts of the climate crisis, humanity must bolster transparency and accountability at all levels, including in pledges from non-state actors (NSAs), according to a new report from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). As the world contends with increasing extreme climate events, such as droughts, floods and wildfires, NSAs can play a critical role in strengthening climate action, experts say. However, their role in national climate efforts remains largely undocumented, according to the UNEP report, prepared with support from the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre (UNEP-CCC) and Danish think tank Concito. The report evaluates national transparency efforts to suggest how to better integrate NSA actions into countries’ policies under the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) of the Paris Agreement. This can ensure stronger climate action and build trust and confidence among Member States. \"In the ongoing battle against climate change, it is becoming increasingly evident that non-state actors, including non-governmental organizations, businesses, cities and local communities, have significant potential to strengthen and support national climate efforts,” said John Christensen, Director of the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre and lead author of the report. “Regrettably, there is a real gap between national efforts under the Enhanced Transparency Framework and the actual contributions of NSAs. “With better integration in national efforts, NSAs can actively respond to government policies, link and strengthen their own climate strategies – including specific emission reduction targets – bolster technical expertise and capacity, and aid in the local execution of national policy objectives.” The foundation of the global climate regime lies in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, primarily through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The credibility of this international accord hinges on countries’ ability to fulfill their obligations, document results transparently, and report progress effectively. However, not all commitments are subject to the same criteria and benchmarks, allowing certain actors, such as fossil fuel companies, to make incomplete pledges that UN Secretary-General António Guterres earlier this year as “rank deception” and a “toxic cover-up”. The ETF therefore plays a pivotal role in documenting climate action and monitoring individual countries' progress to ultimately drive increased collective ambition under the Paris Agreement. aims to help bolster connections between NSAs and the ETF. NSA commitments – including credible annual disclosures of greenhouse gas data, standardization of methods and protocols, independent verification – are critical to addressing the climate crisis. Linking these to ETF standards enhances these pledges’ credibility and stimulates greater action and ambition from both governments and NSAs, experts say. By analysing how transparency efforts have evolved under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and what can be learned from this process, the report highlights the need to build on a sound scientific foundation, maintain strong monitoring, reporting, and verification efforts, and enhance capacity for actors who may lack the capability to participate. Achieving these ambitions requires participation from all stakeholders, according to the report. © 2024 UNEP"

The call for action comes amid growing concerns over the detrimental impact of land degradation, drought and desertification on the continent’s socio-economic stability, food security, and environmental sustainability. The call came as Environment Ministers concluded the 10th Special Session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment ( ) with the adoption of the on 6 September, which made the call for a drought management protocol and expressed deep concern over the environmental challenges Africa faces – particularly rising temperatures and land degradation – and stressed that inaction weakens social and ecosystems resilience across African countries. \"Prolonged droughts are resulting in adverse consequences, including loss of livelihoods, food and water insecurity, conflicts, and forced displacement. These challenges undermine poverty eradication efforts and threaten the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Africa Union ,” said Seyoum Mekonen Hailu, Ethiopia’s State Minister of Planning and Development (in charge of Environment and Climate Change) and President of the special AMCEN session. Ministers highlighted the integral work of the Africa Groups of Negotiators as they engage in several upcoming international conferences and negotiations and noted that the special session provided a clear mandate and solidly endorsed the common African positions, as well as strengthened global and regional partnerships involving governments, international organizations, civil society, academia, local communities, and the private sector. H.E. Robert Beugré Mambé, Prime Minister of Côte d’Ivoire, emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating: \"The survival of our economies and people is at stake. In times like these, it is essential for Africa to work in synergy to tackle climate challenges. Together, we are strong.\" “Africa is a continent of solutions. Solutions to renewable energy in the form of vast solar, wind and hydro resources, and critical minerals. Solutions to food security, with fertile lands and competent farming communities. Solutions for innovation, as Africa has both youth and experience in a population eager to put its shoulder to the wheel for growth, prosperity, opportunity and development,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. Ahead of international meetings – Conferences of the Parties (COPs) - on , , , and later this year, UNEP’s Executive Director rallied the African Ministers to unite as they seek to address the growing impact on the continent of the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution and waste. “African nations can go to these COPs with a strong position on land. Link land restoration, land management and land productivity to climate pledges and to national biodiversity strategies and action plans,” she added. “Public and private finance needs to ramp up. Food systems need to reform. And pollution needs to be addressed. In this last regard, African nations can help deliver a strong instrument to end plastic pollution at the final round of talks in Busan at the end of this year.” Speaking at the special session, Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of UNCCD, highlighted the need to revise development policies to address the root causes of land degradation. “The land must not be seen only as a source of extraction: extraction of agricultural products, extraction of minerals, and extraction of water resources. Nor must the land be seen only through the lenses of exploitation,” he said. “As the land is our most precious asset for our food, our clothes, our fuels, and our animals' feed, we need to adopt a managerial rather than an exploitative attitude. An asset — especially such a precious asset — ought to be managed, with a whole-of-government and a whole-of-society approach.” The Abidjan Declaration also emphasized the need for innovative financing models to unlock the USD 1.2 trillion required to implement the . In 2023, over $400 billion was spent on clean energy projects globally, but only $2.6 billion reached African nations. “In Africa, as in all regions, the climate crisis is an economic sinkhole, sucking the momentum out of economic growth. It is African nations and people who are paying the heaviest price. But it would be entirely incorrect for any world leader — especially in the G20 — to think that although this is all incredibly sad, ultimately, it’s not my problem” said Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ). As the international community looks ahead to COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, UNFCCC’s Executive Secretary called for a new international climate financial goal, firmly grounded in the needs of developing countries. “COP29 must signal that the climate crisis is core business for every government, with finance solutions to match,” he added. Astrid Schomaker, Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), highlighted the growing leadership of African nations in establishing effective coordination bodies that support the alignment of various Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs). “We have seen a number of African countries set up coordination bodies that support dialogue and alignment across various Multilateral Environmental Agreements. These experiences should be replicated across the continent and beyond,” she said, emphasizing the importance of collaborative approaches in environmental governance. Requested by the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment at its 17 ordinary session, UNEP and the African Development Bank also presented a teaser of the soon to be launched during this special session in Abidjan; the Atlas highlights Africa's rich natural resources and the urgent need for its sustainable management. Africa holds 8% of the world’s natural gas, 12% of its oil reserves, and 30% of global mineral deposits. Its fisheries are valued at over $24 billion, and it contains more than 60% of the world’s undeveloped arable land. Ministers also endorsed an on advancing Africa’s common positions at Conferences of the Parties and other meetings. The 10 Special Session of AMCEN, held on 5 and 6 September, followed a Regional Consultative Meeting of UNEP Major Groups and Stakeholders and an Expert Group Meeting focusing on the severity of droughts due to rising global temperatures and land degradation. The sets the environmental agenda in Africa. Established in 1985, the Conference brings together African governments, institutions and development partners to craft polices aimed at tackling the continent’s most pressing environmental issues. Its mandate is to provide advocacy for environmental protection in Africa; to ensure that basic human needs are met adequately and in a sustainable manner; to ensure that social and economic development is realized at all levels; and to ensure that agricultural activities and practices meet the food security needs of the region.

        "meta_description": "Buoyed by several recent rulings, a growing number of countries and rights groups are going to court to compel fossil fuel companies, and others, to act on climate change.",
        "content": "So far, it has been a successful year in the courts for climate change activists. In April, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Switzerland under European law to combat climate change. And last month, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea – a United Nations body – said countries have to safeguard the ocean from greenhouse gas emissions. These are the latest victories in an ongoing legal battle over climate change action. Backed by a series of landmark rulings, citizens, non-profit groups and disaster-wracked countries are increasingly turning to courts to compel governments and fossil fuel producers to address the . This year promises to be a seminal one for climate litigation, experts say, with several key cases to be heard in courts around the world. \"We have seen an accelerating wave of climate litigation in national and sub-national court rooms since we started tracking this seven years ago,” says Andrew Raine, Deputy Director of the Law Division at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “This year is particularly significant as litigation has also recently started – for the first time – in international courts and tribunals.\" One Caribbean island nation, Antigua and Barbuda, is at the forefront of this push. It has backed a requesting the International Court of Justice to weigh in on the obligations of states in respect of climate change. That case, still in progress, comes with the country facing increasingly severe weather. In 2017, devastated the nation of 93,000 people, leaving it with a US$220 million recovery bill. At the same time, warming waters have bleached many of the country’s coral reefs while rising sea waters are eroding beaches and damaging the tourism industry, a key source of revenue. Zachary Phillips is a Crown Counsel within the Attorney General’s Chambers of Antigua and Barbuda and a member of the country’s delegation to the (UNFCC), a global agreement to counter the climate crisis. He has clear memories of Irma. “Ninety-six per cent of all infrastructure on Barbuda was completely destroyed,” he says. “Hurricanes are something I have experienced since I was a child but I have seen an increase in their severity.” A released last year revealed the number of climate change litigation cases rose to 2,180 in 2022 from 884 in 2017. The type of cases has varied, with some plaintiffs challenging the lack of enforcement of climate-related laws. Other litigants are seeking to keep fossil fuels in the ground and hold corporations liable for damage to the environment. The groups pursuing redress in the courts and tribunals are diverse. They include nations , like Antigua and Barbuda, mainly part of coalitions, such as the . Cities, such as , have also launched cases, as have civil society groups. One of those groups included Swiss seniors who in the European Court of Human Rights that their health was threatened by heatwaves made worse by the climate crisis. Indigenous Peoples too, are increasingly going to court, arguing that the climate crisis is affecting their culture, their access to food and water, and ultimately their lives. The raft of cases comes with the climate crisis deepening and the world greenhouse emissions in line with the , negotiated under the UNFCCC. Does this rise in climate cases showcase the fact that international climate diplomacy is failing, as some have suggested? “I think the argument that the pursuit of this sort of litigation will undermine the UNFCCC process is a red herring,” Phillips says. “I think both are necessary to achieve the goals we need because no state alone can solve climate change.” This is echoed by UNEP’s Raine. “It is too early to say multilateral diplomacy has failed but it is true that it is not succeeding fast enough,” he says. “A lot of climate litigation we have seen focuses on seeking to address government responses that are inadequate to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.” Environmental law has been strengthened in recent years, with the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. Meanwhile, environmental courts and tribunals in at least 67 countries have opened their doors to foreign plaintiffs, which have allowed local companies to be sued for their environmental transgressions abroad. Raine says climate litigation is becoming an increasingly powerful tool. He mentions a number of successful climate litigation cases, including questioning the constitutionality of Mexican policies that would limit renewable energy. The organization argued that this would effectively prevent Mexico from meeting its emissions reductions targets. In other , Brazil’s Supreme Court recognized the Paris Agreement as a human rights treaty, which enjoys “supranational” status, placing it above national laws. A Dutch court ordered oil and gas company Shell to comply with the Paris Agreement and reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. And the UN Human Rights Committee that Australia’s government is in violation of its human rights obligations to Torres Strait Islanders by not doing enough to slow climate change, the first ruling of its kind. Later this year, advisory opinions are set to be delivered by the and the in the case backed by Antigua and Barbuda. For Phillips, the outcome of the latter case will be key, which is taking a broad look at “the scope of international law” and the responsibilities countries have to address climate change. Phillips says island nations, like Antigua and Barbuda, are suffering deeply from climate change. He believes courtroom victories will help them push for more concrete action on the crisis during negotiations with other countries. “Ultimately, the right support from these international tribunals and courts will allow us to say ‘the [status quo] is wrong.'” © 2024 UNEP"

It calls on decision makers to take immediate action to address pressing environmental issues to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as other internationally-agreed goals, such as the Paris Agreement. 1. UNEP’s sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6) is the most comprehensive report on the global environment since 2012. It shows that the overall environmental situation globally is deteriorating and the window for action is closing. 2. GEO-6 shows that a healthy environment is both a prerequisite and a foundation for economic prosperity, human health and wellbeing. It addresses the main challenge of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: that no one should be left behind, and that all should live healthy, fulfilling lives for the full benefit of all, for both present and future generations. 3. Unsustainable production and consumption patterns and trends and inequality, when combined with increases in the use of resources that are driven by population growth, put at risk the healthy planet needed to attain sustainable development. Those trends are leading to a deterioration in planetary health at unprecedented rates, with increasingly serious consequences, in particular for poorer people and regions. 4. Furthermore, the world is not on track to achieve the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals or other internationally-agreed environmental goals by 2030; nor is it on track to deliver long-term sustainability by 2050. Urgent action and strengthened international cooperation are urgently needed to reverse those negative trends and restore planetary and human health. 5. Past and present greenhouse gas emissions have already committed the world to an extended period of climate change with multiple and increasing environmental and society-wide risks. The sixth Global Environment Outlook, or GEO-6, is the world’s most comprehensive environmental report, covering a range of topics, issues and potential solutions. At present, the world is not on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. UNEP's GEO-6 calls for policy interventions that address entire systems in order to lead to healthy lives for all people. Nairobi, Kenya, 13 March, 2019 – The most comprehensive and rigorous assessment on the state of the environment completed by the UN in the last five years was published today, warning that damage to the planet is so dire that people’s health will be increasingly threatened unless urgent action is taken. The report, which was produced by 250 scientists and experts from… UN Environment’s Sixth Global Environmental Outlook (GEO-6) is the most comprehensive assessment of the state of the world's environment. The report also offers a rigorous analysis of our prospects for a healthy future. We’ve made progress, but we have a long way to go. It’s time for us all to comprehend the transformations that will be required to protect our planet’s health. © 2024 UNEP"

        "content": "About 250 environmental scientists this week in Nairobi, Kenya, to discuss an advanced draft of the latest , a landmark report expected to showcase solutions to some of the planet’s most-pressing environmental challenges. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has issued a reviewers from around the world, and ensure the report presents robust science and peer-reviewed evidence and data. This will be the , since 1995. The series has become a go-to scientific resource for policymakers, providing them with peer-reviewed data and evidence-based analysis on everything from pollution to climate change. GEO-7 is produced by hundreds of experts from around the world under the stewardship of UNEP. The , the world’s top decision-making body on the environment, the latest edition in 2022. Expected to be published in December 2025, it will be the first report in the series to focus on solutions to the triple planetary crisis of , , and . Its long-term goal is to help humanity live more sustainably. Putting together such a wide-ranging report is an immense undertaking and the GEO-7 drafting process has not been without its fair share of challenges. One has been enlisting the expertise of reviewers from around the globe. We recently sat down with Nyovani Madise, the GEO-7 co-chair and a director at the African Institute for Development Policy, to discuss the importance of GEO-7 and the vital role that reviewers play in the drafting process. This is a truly global assessment of the state of the environment. It takes stock of where we are now and how the triple planetary crisis of , , and are impacting our lives, our livelihoods and the world’s ability to achieve the . When we look at where things are, especially with respect to the triple planetary crisis, we are not where we should be. And more worryingly, we are not moving in the right direction if we want to live in peace with nature. GEO-7 will be a solution-focused report. It will say to governments and policymakers: here are the range of options that you can adopt to achieve agreed targets as well as socio-economic goals. Yes, we need more energy. Yes, we need more development. Yes, we need more natural resources. But here are ways we can provide all those more efficiently and more sustainably, and not at the expense of nature and not by continuing business as usual, which is how we got ourselves into this mess. What is taking place in Nairobi is the third writers’ workshop where they are working not only on their respective chapters but also working together. They are discussing and responding to the comments and questions from a first set of reviewers. The same way that the environmental crises facing us are interdependent, the report will be made up of chapters that are interconnected, so that the solutions the report proposes will be holistic. It takes time and a great deal of effort to bring together this team of more than 250 scientists and experts to author one document that is innovative and solutions-oriented. Another big challenge has been the availability of new and fresh empirical research. We are using existing models that need to be updated. Right now, we need more expert reviewers from around the world that can ask: “Is this document scientifically sound? Does this resonate with me given what I know about this subject?” The more diverse the pool of reviewers, the better the report will be. I would like to encourage scientists, especially women and those who are in universities and think tanks in the Global South, to heed our call for reviewers and participate. As the co-chair of GEO-7 and as a scientist, the reason why I accepted to be part of this process is because I wanted to know that there is representation from my part of the world. The document is advocating for specific solutions and the reviewers will tell us if the solutions being proposed will work in their specific contexts. That evidence is important because we can incorporate it into the final report. If we are going to encourage policymakers to adopt a set of solutions, they need the assurance that the science is robust and peer-reviewed. © 2024 UNEP"

        "content": "Two of the largest reservoirs in America, which provide water and electricity to millions, are in danger of reaching ‘dead pool status,’ a result of the climate crisis and overconsumption of water, experts say. Lake Mead, in Nevada and Arizona, and Lake Powell, in Utah and Arizona, . ‘Dead pool’ status would mean the water level in the dams was so low it could no longer flow downstream and power hydroelectric power stations. The Lake Mead reservoir, which is the largest artificial body of water in America, was created in the 1930s by the construction of the Hoover Dam, an engineering masterpiece. Lake Powell, the second largest, was created in the 1960s with the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam. “The conditions in the American west, which we're seeing around the Colorado River basin, have been so dry for more than 20 years that we're no longer speaking of a drought,” said Lis Mullin Bernhardt, an ecosystems expert at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “We refer to it as “aridification” – a new very dry normal.” Lake Mead and Lake Powell not only provide water and electricity to tens of millions in Nevada, Arizona, California, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and Mexico, but they also provide irrigation water for agriculture. Experts warn that as the crisis deepens, water cuts will need to be introduced, but this may not be enough. “While regulating and managing water supply and demand are essential in both the short and long term, climate change is at the heart of this issue,” said Maria Morgado, UNEP’s Ecosystems Officer in North America. “In the long term, we need to address the root causes of climate change as well as water demands.” Over the past 20 years, were caused by floods, droughts and other water-related events. With more frequent droughts, people in water-scarce areas will increasingly depend on groundwater because of its buffer capacity and resilience to climate variability. Increases in water demand due to growing populations and irrigation for agriculture have been compounded by climate change impacts such as reductions in precipitation and temperature rises. A rise in temperature leads to increased evaporation of surface water and baking of the earth, decreasing soil moisture. This is part of a wider trend affecting hundreds of millions of people across the planet. As climate change wreaks havoc on the Earth’s interconnected natural systems, drought and desertification are swiftly becoming the new normal, everywhere from the United States to Europe and Africa. , a 2022 report from the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, found that since 1970 weather, climate and water hazards have accounted for 50 per cent of all disasters and impact 55 million people globally every year. The report also found that 2.3 billion people face water stress annually. Drought is also one of several factors that impacts land degradation, affecting half the world’s population and impacting croplands, drylands, wetlands, forests and grasslands. , of which UNEP is one of the leading members, was set up to protect and restore ecosystems around the world.

        "meta_description": "Burundi’s farmers and fishers are adapting to climate crisis with help from a UNEP-supported project.",
        "content": "It was a late evening in April 2018 when Philbert Ntaciyica, exhausted from the non-stop heavy rain battering his roof, wondered if his farm would survive this latest storm. When the 12-hour downpour finally eased in Nzove, a village perched on a hillside in north-eastern Burundi, Ntaciyica emerged from his home to find no crops or topsoil. All had been washed downhill by the deluge, and along with them, his livelihood. “We had nothing left,” said Ntaciyica. “We were forced to sell our livestock. Our children couldn’t eat well. They went from two meals a day to one.” Along with most other men in the village, the father-of-six was forced to leave his wife and young children behind and travel to neighbouring Rwanda for work. The storm that ravaged Ntaciyica's village is part of a wave of extreme weather that has struck Burundi in recent years, a product of climate change, scientists say. Although the nation greenhouse gas emissions per capita than almost any other country on Earth, it bears a disproportionately heavy burden from the climate crisis. The situation is only set to deteriorate. Temperatures are expected to rise between in the country by 2050, while rainfall patterns are projected to become , leading to protracted dry seasons, more flooding and increased erosion. This will put a mounting strain on agriculture, food security and access to safe water across the country. In the years to come, Burundi, like much of Africa, will face the monumental challenge of adapting to these changes. Countries will need solutions, like developing drought-resilient agriculture, building seawalls to protect coastal cities, improving water security to withstand droughts, and a whole lot more. Recent studies have predicted African countries on average, may have to spend up to on climate adaptation than they do on healthcare. Yet the gap in financing for adaptation is both stark and widening. The estimated adaptation costs in the developing world are than the finance currently provided. A United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) project funded by the Adaptation Fund is helping Ntaciyica and 2,000 farmers like him adopt to less predictable weather in Burundi. In partnership with Burundi’s Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock, the project, called the Adapting to Climate Change in the Lake Victoria Basin initiative, has provided funding and training for farming cooperatives to plant 230,000 trees, including avocado and grevillea, to help prevent soil erosion. Not only do the trees absorb carbon, their roots keep the soil in place and their leaves provide shade from the equatorial sun, slowing evaporation and locking moisture in the soil. In this region, farmers tend to till the soil vertically along the slope, which makes the topsoil even more susceptible to erosion from increasingly extreme rainfall. To stop soil from sliding down the hillside, the project is helping farmers to construct terraces along the contours of 240 hectares of farmland and subsequently stabilizing the terraces by planting elephant grass along their fringes. The good news for Ntaciyica is that heavy rains no longer wash away his best soil. His harvests of beans and cassava have increased, his goats have extra food from the elephant grass and he has more money to invest in his children’s education. “The contours help us to prevent soil erosion and landslides,” he said, gazing up the hill at his farm. “Because the water remains in those contours, it keeps the land moist and we get better harvests. Where we used to harvest one sack, now we get two.” Having seen the positive results, Ntaciyica’s neighbours are now constructing their own terraces lined with soil-binding grasses. Further downhill, Lake Rweru fisher Ezechiel Bizimana blames increased erosion and landslides upstream on declining fish stocks. He has seen his catch gradually fall over his lifetime and says that the lake has already lost three species of fish. Climate change is making things worse, he says, as reduced rainfall has lowered the water level in the lake. “I started fishing when I was 10 years old,” Bizimana recalls. “We used to get 50kg a day, but now we rarely get more than 25kg.” Nutrient-rich soil particles carried by floods from deforested upland areas can upset lake ecosystems, lowering the oxygen level in the water. The silt also clogs fish gills and spoils spawning grounds. In parts of the lake near where the terraces have been constructed, Bizimana said he has observed an improvement in water quality, hinting at a potential reversal in fortunes for the depleted fish stocks. Like the farmers, Bizimana and around 30 other fishers have received support from the project. They are among some of the first in East Africa to try out a new fish-drying kiln constructed by the project, which creates a better-tasting, longer-lasting smoked fish. Not only does less fish go to waste but the end product can fetch a 50 per cent mark-up at the market. Crucially, the dryer uses almost 97 per cent less firewood than traditional smokers, reducing deforestation and providing further protection for the lake’s ecosystem. As Ntaciyica’s and Bizimana’s experiences show, protecting and harnessing nature upstream pays dividends for people downstream. In all, the livelihoods of 45 million people across Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya rely on the natural resources of the Lake Victoria Basin, which climate change is putting under ever-greater pressure. The UNEP-supported project in Nzove is building the capacity of the five governments to establish a regional framework to guide adaptation actions and provide a platform for countries to share best practices. Regional policy frameworks, informed by experiences on the ground, are vital for adapting to transboundary climate impacts, say those involved. “The project is demonstrating how small steps taken on the ground, underpinned by a coherent adaptation strategy, can significantly enhance people’s lives and livelihoods,” says Jessica Troni, Head of UNEP’s Climate Change Adaptation Unit. “Scaling-up such initiatives across the five countries that rely on the Lake Victoria Basin ecosystem has the potential to help millions of farmers and fishermen become more resilient to climate change.” © 2024 UNEP"

        "content": "Each morning in Addis Ababa, the bustling capital of Ethiopia, the same scene plays out. As the sun rises, thousands of commuters jostle for space on public minibuses. Others hop on the city’s light rail line, the first network of its kind in Africa. Notably absent are bicycles; cyclists are not something seen regularly on these streets. Ephrem Bekele Woldeyesus wants to change that. The 34-year-old co-founded a community organization, Along the Way, that aims to make cycling common in the capital, in part to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the climate crisis. “It’s good for the environment and people’s health,” Woldeyesus said of cycling. “But here, people think it’s not safe. There are too many cars.” Woldeyesus is among a growing number of campaigners and government officials who want to make cycling and walking safer in Africa’s cities, where roads are notoriously dangerous. They believe that will lead more people to choose what’s known as active mobility, reducing gridlock and helping to counter a climate crisis that is already on the continent of 1.3 billion. “Walking and cycling has huge benefits for people and the planet, improving health, reducing our carbon footprint and improving air quality.” Urban transport will be a focus of , taking place from 4-8 September in Nairobi, Kenya. The annual event, which will feature policymakers from across the continent, is designed to help African states navigate the climate crisis, including by cutting their greenhouse gas emissions. The region, though, is contributors to climate change. In many ways, Ethiopia has become a model for the environmental potential of active mobility. The country, with support from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), has launched an ambitious effort to convince citizens to keep walking and to take up cycling while steering clear of soot-spewing vehicles. The centrepiece of the push is the country’s Non-Motorized Transport Strategy. Launched in 2020, it sets several 10-year targets, including the construction of 3km of footpaths and 2km of bike paths per 10,000 people. It also aims to keep the number of kilometers travelled by private motor vehicle to 2020 levels and reduce fatalities of pedestrians and cyclists by 80 percent below 2019 levels. That is considered crucial for encouraging people to take the two-wheel plunge. In Ethiopia, there are around , according to the World Health Organization. The fatality figure is considered high given that there are only 1.1 million cars for a population of 99 million. Along with the active mobility strategy, Ethiopia has also launched road safety and transport plans while forging a partnership with the private sector to improve walking and cycling infrastructure. “Cycling is beneficial because it is environmentally friendly, economical and has health benefits,” said Fetiya Dedegeba, Deputy Executive Director of the Ethiopian Road Safety and Insurance Fund. The active mobility movement is spreading across Africa. In Nairobi, all new roads are built with a footpath and a bike path. Twenty per cent of the Nairobi city transport budget is dedicated to active mobility, a policy UNEP has helped push. Rwanda has introduced fortnightly car-free days where roads are turned over to walkers, joggers, roller skaters and cyclists. Guraride, an app that allows users to rent bikes and electric-powered two wheelers, has also been introduced. As well, the country, with the help of UNEP, developed a that calls for all new roads to be built with traffic calming measures and adequate sidewalks, making them safer for cyclists and pedestrians. Across much of Africa, though, roads remain perilous. The continent is home to of global road traffic deaths, despite only having 3 per cent of the world’s registered vehicles. An average of 260 pedestrians and 18 cyclists are killed in Africa every day. That is largely due to a lack of infrastructure, poor urban planning and bad driving. Experts believe tackling those safety concerns could lead to a flowering of active mobility across the continent, something that would bring with it a range of benefits. “Walking and cycling have huge benefits for people and the planet, improving health, reducing our carbon footprint and improving air quality,” said Rob de Jong, head of UNEP’s mobility unit. A UNEP found that a person who cycled instead of taking five short car trips a week would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they are responsible for by 86kg a year. The move away from cars and minibuses, many of which are , would also help to reduce other types of airborne contaminants, said de Jong. “Many of these vehicles emit 10 times what they should,” said de Jong, who added that in many African countries automobile numbers double every decade. “Motor vehicle ownership is rapidly increasing so this is something we need to be critically aware of.” In Ethiopia, Seble Samuel, a cycling advocate, set up a campaign called Streets for the People, which, on the last Sunday of each month, sees thoroughfares closed to cars. On those days, the streets take on a party feel as hundreds of cyclists are joined by skateboarders, rollerbladers, joggers and families picnicking. The movement started in Addis Ababa but has now spread to other Ethiopian cities, such as Jimma Mekelle and Bahir Dar. “I’d lived in South America and seen how open street days could bring communities together,” said Samuel. “In Ethiopia, cycling is seen as something poor people do. If we lift those barriers…. we can tackle air pollution while promoting healthy and sustainable transport.” . © 2024 UNEP"

        "meta_description": "The switch to more efficient lighting could save three power plants worth of energy and help cut greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "content": "Sitting at the base of Islamabad’s Margalla Hills is the Raziuddin Siddiqi Memorial Library, a four-storey building packed with more than 2 million books, CDs and DVDs. Along with being one of Pakistan’s largest libraries, Raziuddin Siddiqi is unique for another reason: on entering the building one won’t hear the tell-tale flicker of fluorescent lights. That is because the library has replaced all 103 of the fluorescent tubes on its ground floor with energy-efficient light-emitting-diodes (LEDs), part of a complete overhaul of its lighting system. The LEDs use around one-quarter the power of the library’s old setup and provide better illumination. “We understand the importance of energy-efficient lighting both in terms of the environment and as a cost saving measure,” says Anwar Ejaz, the chief librarian. The library lighting overhaul was part of a larger project supported by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the and the Pakistan National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority. The effort encourages homeowners, companies and the private sector to switch from power-hungry incandescent bulbs and florescent lights to high-quality energy-efficient lighting products. The transition could help save three power plants worth of energy by 2030. That is considered an important step for a country facing power shortages and aiming to reduce its emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases. “While energy efficiency seems like a relatively small thing to do, and it often gets overlooked, its impact can be huge,” says Paul Kellett, the team leader of UNEP’s programme. “It has the potential to be a game changer.” Kellett’s comments come just ahead of the first on 26 January, which is showcasing how energy efficiency can help counter climate change. According to the International Energy Agency, needed to achieve the targets of the . Pakistan relies on oil, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, coal, hydroelectricity and nuclear energy for its power. During summer, when demand for air-conditioning peaks, the country faces an . This leads to rolling black outs, which limit economic growth and make life difficult for citizens. The energy sector is the most significant contributor to the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. In 2018, Pakistan emitted of carbon dioxide equivalent, nearly 45 per cent of which came from energy. By 2050 energy is expected to make up 64 per cent of total emissions in Pakistan. is still without access to electricity. As people are connected to the power grid, demand will rapidly increase, making energy efficiency more important, say observers. Alongside its work in energy efficiency, the Government of Pakistan has taken a number of steps to combat climate change. These include the project. Launched in 2014, the project aims to turn 350,000 hectares of degraded land into forest, which will sequester over 148 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over the next 10 years. The government has also pledged to derive 60 per cent of its energy from renewable sources and said no new coal power plants will be built. Along with the work at Raziuddin Siddiqi library, the UNEP-backed energy efficiency project supported the development of regulations to facilitate the national switch to energy-efficient lighting. The project also helped to strengthen national monitoring, verification and enforcement capacity and to roll out a country-wide LED lighting awareness campaign. The initiative is valued at US$7.4 million and received core funding from the Global Environment Facility. “The project is part of a far-reaching drive to bring more efficient lighting projects to Pakistan,” said Kellett. By 2030, the transition to energy-efficient lighting in Pakistan could deliver 1.3 terawatt hours of annual electricity savings, the equivalent of three 100-megawatt power plants. That would spare building owners more than US$290 million in annual electricity costs. The embrace of efficient lighting could also prevent the release of nearly 1.2 megatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually, the equivalent of taking more than 630,000 cars off the road. UNEP’s has found that based on current government policies, the world is on track to warm by a potentially catastrophic 2.9°C by century’s end. The report found that to meet the goals of the humanity needs to reduce greenhouse gases by unprecedented levels over the next seven years. “Projects such as this are crucial in helping countries reach their climate pledges,” says Kellett. “We know we need to reduce emissions and projects such as this can show us how.” © 2024 UNEP"

        "meta_description": "In Mexico rainwater harvesting holds the key to battling impacts of climate",
        "content": "The city of Xalapa, Mexico is bordered by more than 5,300 hectares of mountain forest, a sprawling green sponge that soaks up rainwater and slowly, predictably, releases it to residents downstream. At least, it used to. A combination of climate change and deforestation is ravaging Xalapa’s protective tree cover. This is threatening water supplies for around 600,000 people and leaving Xalapa’s bare slopes vulnerable to landslides. Enter , an initiative led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and funded by the . It is helping Xalapa’s residents build a protective buffer of plants and trees high in the city’s hills. This defensive shield is being paired with the construction of rainwater harvesting tanks, which are helping residents to contend with a surge in droughts, another byproduct of the climate crisis. “Xalapa is a paradox,” said Sergio Angón, National Project Coordinator for CityAdapt. Despite its 1,400mm of rainfall a year, he said, it still has water shortages. “This is the impact of climate change.” The type of work being done in Xalapa is known as climate change adaptation and was a focus of discussions last month in Panama, where leaders gathered for . The event was a precursor to the , also known as COP28, which takes place later this month in the United Arab Emirates. COP 28 comes with climate change’s impacts accelerating around the world. Government policies now in place could see the world by century’s end, potentially setting off a cascade of extreme weather, including droughts, heatwaves and floods. Developing countries will need to spend up to US$387 billion annually to contend with the fallout, according to UNEP’s . They now have access to just a fraction of that total. That is one of the reasons the Xalapa effort, which relies on a combination of low-cost natural and built infrastructure, is considered so important. The capital of the state of Veracruz, the city gets nearly 38 per cent of its drinking water from the cloud forests that loom above it. But urban sprawl – Xalapa’s population has grown seven-fold in the last 30 years – is eating away at tree cover, said Angón. Experts say the cloud forest that surrounds Xalapa is one of the most endangered ecosystems in Mexico and is down to 1 per cent of its original coverage. Since 2017, has been aiming to re-establish the balance between the forest and the city by protecting and restoring ecosystems. The project produced an assessment of Xalapa’s vulnerabilities to climate change. That made clear the city’s greenbelt, which includes a hill named Estropajo and the Molinos de San Roque wetland, was vital to filtering water, increasing groundwater supplies and preventing floods. Project teams, in tandem with local government officials, have worked to revive the greenbelt, sowing more than 6,000 plants, including 3,900 trees. Many of those trees were given to local households, who were taught how to care for them. “We were delighted to work with UNEP on this project,” said Juan Carlos Contreras, Xalapa’s Secretary of the Environment. “In Xalapa, we are on the front line of the fight against climate change and nature-based solutions play a crucial role in protecting us.” Recognizing the greenery would take time to pay dividends, CityAdapt also helped build 12 rainwater harvesting systems in schools and public buildings. Designed to counter droughts, the systems provide more than 20,000 residents with a guaranteed supply of water. Their success led the municipality to install more than 100 other systems, the vast majority in homes, benefitting another 1,200 people. “Rainwater harvesting systems can be make or break for vulnerable climate-hit communities, and when combined with ecosystem restoration and protection, the results are even stronger,” says Jessica Troni, Head of UNEP’s Climate Change Adaptation Unit. The Universidad Veracruzana, one of Mexico’s top-ranked schools, teamed with UNEP to build three rainwater harvesting systems. The institution had long battled to provide students with water, sometimes being forced to truck it in. “During water shortages, Xalapa often only had enough municipal water for a few days per week,” said Laura Bello, who heads up the university’s sustainability group. “We’ve seen just how important low-cost adaptation solutions, like rainwater harvesting, can be for water security in cities.” Along with Xalapa, CityAdapt is working to support Kingston, Jamaica and San Salvador, El Salvador contend with the climate crisis. By pairing green infrastructure, like forests, with grey infrastructure, like water harvesting tanks, it is aiming to increase the climate resilience of close to 100,000 people. “With grey infrastructure the benefits can be more immediate, while green infrastructure is more holistic with added benefits, such as promoting biodiversity and urban amenities,” said Troni. “A combined grey-green approach takes the best of both worlds.” and UNEP’s work with the Global Environment Facility on © 2024 UNEP"

        "meta_description": "The world is warming faster than at any point in recorded history, but we can avoid the worst of those effects. The key is to limit global warming to an average of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. So how do we get there? Here is a roadmap for six key sectors.",
        "content": "The world is warming faster than at any point in recorded history. This is radically changing the Earth’s climate and releasing a wave of extreme weather, including wildfires, hurricanes, floods and droughts. But humanity can still avoid the worst impacts of this climate crisis. To do that, we must prevent the Earth’s temperature from rising more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The only way to avoid catastrophic climate change is to rapidly slash our emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. These emissions, which come largely from burning fossil fuels, have continued to rise in recent decades despite a raft of international accords, including the Paris Agreement. To keep the 1.5°C temperature target alive, the world needs to cut 2030 emissions by 42 per cent. This must be done in tandem with climate adaptation. National Adaptation Plans in particular are crucial for ensuring climate resilience is built into each of the sectors. A little math tells us that to reach that target, we need to reduce our annual emissions by 22 gigatonnes, or 22 billion tonnes of CO equivalent. That might seem like a lot. But by focusing on key sectors, we can get there. By 2025, every country must commit to new National Determined Contributions (NDCs), these NDCs must cover all emissions and sectors. Global ambition in the next round of NDCs must bring global GHG emissions in 2035 to levels consistent with the 1.5°C pathway. Extrapolated from and data from What are these sectors and how and many gigatonnes of emissions can we slash from each? This sector is responsible for about and has an emission reduction potential of 13.6 gigatonnes annually, with agriculture accounting for 91 per cent of these emissions on average. Agriculture, forestry and other land-based industries (AFOLU) are major contributors to climate change. The world can reduce emissions by 7.3 gigatonnes annually if it halts deforestation, ecosystem degradation and restores ecosystems. These actions would also improve air quality, bolster food and water security and shore up rural economies. As well, they could be key contributors to reduce biodiversity loss. Most importantly, investments in land, freshwater and marine ecosystems can make a major contribution to increasing climate resilience (known as 'ecosystem-based adaptation'). The global energy supply system – which includes the production of electricity and heat – is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions, churning out 20 gigatonnes of CO2-eq per year. We can cut 12.6 gigatonnes of emissions annually from the sector by, in part, increasing renewable energy capacity and improving energy efficiency rate. Equivalent to taking 7 billion passengers cars off the road. This transition could also create millions of jobs, improve air quality, save consumers on their electricity bills and expand electricity access to people around the world. Clean energy can also be vital for adapting to climate change. Utilising a diverse variety of renewable energy sources can buffer against potential disruptions from climate impacts, ensuring consistent energy supply. Greenhouse gas emissions from the industry sector in 2019 reached has the potential to reduce its emissions by yearly. It can do this, in part, by electrifying production processes, embracing new fuels, develop innovation in high-emission sectors (steel, cement, aluminium), and decarbonizing oil and gas through methane abatement and carbon management technologies. Industries can increase their resilience to climate impacts by incorporating climate risk and projections into business plans and future investments. The global transport sector has the highest reliance on fossil fuels of any sector. It is responsible for , which represents 15 per cent of the global total emissions. These emissions are set to double – growing faster than any other industry. Most of this growth will take place in the Global South - in countries which already today are suffering disproportionately from high petroleum fuel prices. We could reduce emissions in the transport sector by 3.8 gigatonnes annually by switching to electric vehicles, more fully embracing public transit and better designing cities so that their citizens require less travel. Shifting to locally generated low-carbon electricity instead of using imported petroleum fuels for motorised transport will reduce fuel import bills, increase energy security and add to local value creation. To build resilience, climate risk and vulnerability assessments should be incorporated into planning the design, construction and operation of transport infrastructure to withstand extreme weather conditions. The construction and operation of the world’s buildings is responsible for . They are responsible for and 37 per cent of energy and process-related carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions. The emissions reduction potential in buildings is and 2 Gt for direct and indirect emissions (electricity and heat). According to the IPCC, the building sector mitigation policies can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 90 per cent in developed countries and up to 80 per cent in developing countries, and help lift up to 2.8 billion people in developing countries out of energy poverty. To decrease emissions in the building sector, we must minimize excess floor space, reduce energy intensity of buildings, reduce emissions intensity of energy use in buildings, and decrease emissions from construction, especially embodied carbon. An integrated approach to both adaptation and mitigation in the sector is essential. Buildings designed with climate adaptation can also contribute to reduced energy consumption and thus mitigation. Fluorinated gases (F-gases) comprise of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), as well as nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). They cut across all sectors. The United Nations Environment Programme works across sectors to support the transition to a low-carbon, more resilient future where we reduce emissions and ensure the sectors can also adapt to the climate impacts that are expected. We enable science-based decision-making, capacity support and institutional strengthening and provide tools and guidance on legal and financial frameworks that enable climate-smart development.

        "content": "On the busy streets of Togo’s capital, Lomé, change is afoot amongst some of the city’s motorcycle taxi drivers. They’re going electric. At a battery swapping station, drivers are quick to share their enthusiasm for their new e-motorcycles, replacements for the petrol-powered models they once rode. “I can say there are four advantages or benefits to using an electric motorcycle,” says Aounon Yao, who recently switched from driving a combustion-powered motorcycle. “Firstly, the electric motorcycle is half the price to run. Secondly, it doesn't explode in the event of an accident. Thirdly, it reduces noise and air pollution. And fourthly, it is healthy to ride.” However, even with the clear benefits to switching to e-motorcycles, the transition away from the combustion engine has been slow across Africa. There are an estimated two- and three-wheelers on the road in Africa, corresponding to an estimated annual market value of US$4.8 billion. Less than 1 per cent of these vehicles are electric. Most of the two- and three-wheelers are still using internal combustion engines and rely on fossil fuels. When burned, fossil fuels pollute the air and warm the planet. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the (GEF) are assisting governments from 41 countries to accelerate the uptake of e-mobility as part of the . The programme has been helping Togo move towards its goals by supporting the development of a national e-mobility policy. The policy aims to put in place regulatory and fiscal mechanisms to make electric vehicles mainstream. Mery Yaou, Director of the Environment at Togo’s , says one of the government’s objectives is to make the country a regional leader in e-mobility. “There are already almost 3,000 e-motorcycles on the road in Togo, so from Togo, I think the market will spread throughout the region,” says Yaou. Research shows that shifting two- and three-wheelers to electric has the potential to reduce between of carbon dioxide emissions every year. However, in Africa, only approximately 20,000 electric motorcycles have been deployed across the continent, amounting to less than . The reason for this slow uptake is multifaceted. Since the 1990s, two- and three-wheelers have exploded in popularity, primarily due to the failure of public transport services to serve the population in urban and rural areas. The absence of financing for electric motorcycle importers has held back development, as has limited battery charging and swapping infrastructure. Another need has been for the development and implementation of clear national strategies to promote, finance and scale-up low-carbon electric mobility. The world must cut greenhouse gas emissions by by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Fossil fuels, including oil, coal and gas, are responsible for nearly of carbon dioxide emissions. Experts say there is a pressing need for a shift to alternative energy sources. UNEP Director of the Industry and Economy Division Sheila Aggarwal-Khan says it is essential that low- and middle-income countries are part of a global shift to zero-emissions electric mobility – to meet the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement and to reduce air pollution. “With two and three-wheelers playing an important role in local economies, Africa has the potential to leapfrog the conventional mobility pathway by moving directly to electric vehicles,” Aggarwal-Khan says. “Togo is showing how a combination of private sector initiative and government support can accelerate the introduction of e-mobility that meets local market needs, from the bottom up.” Battery-powered transportation is cleaner than fossil-fuel-based transit, but it comes with its own costs. Lithium-ion batteries rely on the extraction of minerals—especially lithium and cobalt—while improper battery disposal can harm the environment. Alongside work to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles in Togo and around the world, UNEP is ramping up efforts to develop a circular economy for electric vehicle batteries. By promoting innovative battery design and increasing recycling in the battery industry, countries can reduce the need for virgin raw materials. Meanwhile, in Togo, the message is clear. “Do your utmost to change your combustion motorcycle for an electric one,” electric motorbike driver Amegan Kpe Yao says. “Given that the environment is everything, we must not contribute to its degradation.” © 2024 UNEP"

        "meta_description": "In Panama, solar power provides a solution to heating water and reducing deforestation.",
        "content": "A few dozen kilometres inland from northern Panama’s coast is the Hato Chami school. Set amid winding roads, green trees and stunning mountains, it has more than 1,000 pupils, most of whom hail from one of Panama’s largest indigenous groups, the Ngäbe. The single-storey school stands out from other buildings in the impoverished Hato Chami region because of the solar water heaters fitted to its roof. The recently installed devices allow students to take hot showers and make it easier for staff to boil water when preparing meals. “People think that because Panama is a hot country there is no need for hot water,” said Luis Navntoft, an advisor at , a broad-based partnership that installed the solar water heaters. “They are often not aware about the need for heat, either for hot water or cooking.\" Termosolar is funded by the and supported by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the National Secretariat of Energy, the Ministry of the Environment, Banco General, the Technological University of Panama and the Panama Green Building Council. Innovative Partnerships like Termosolar are expected to be a focus of discussions on 20 September as world leaders gather for the in New York. Part of the UN General Assembly, the event is designed to help supercharge the global effort to both counter and adapt to the climate crisis. “People think that because Panama is a hot country there is no need for hot water. They are often not aware about the need for heat, either for hot water, cooking or conditioning.” Hato Chami is not unique in Latin America and the Caribbean. Many schools, hospitals and homes are without hot water. Electric water heaters are expensive and until recently solar was an untapped commodity. Many communities rely on firewood for heating – with the chopping of trees leading to deforestation. Globally, trees soak up 30 per cent of emissions from industry and fossil fuels, but every year 10 million hectares of forests are , with deforestation accounting for 11 per cent of carbon emissions. Projects like Termosolar Panama can help keep trees in the ground. “Hot water is one of the easiest things to make sustainable, through solar thermal,” said Geordie Colville, UNEP’s Chief of Energy and Climate. “But even in tropical countries, such as Panama, where the sun is plentiful, a large proportion of water is heated by non-sustainable means.” Alongside countering deforestation, solar hot water heating could also help Panama cut its reliance on fossil fuels, particularly liquefied petroleum gas. A driver of climate change, according to Termosolar Panama the fuel is used to heat most of the over 30 million litres of hot water Panamanians use daily. Termosolar Panama is part of a wider Panamanian effort to move away from fossil fuels. This includes a national strategy to deploy 1 million square meters of solar thermal technology throughout the country by 2050. When fully implemented, Panama’s National Solar Thermal Plan will prevent the release of 2.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and save Panamanians more than US$110 million annually on fossil fuel bills. “[Termosolar Panama] gives me an explosion of good feelings,” said Rosilena Lindo, the Deputy Secretary of Energy in Panama. “It is building a family around solar in Panama and really helping raise awareness and capacity.” Raising awareness was one of Termosolar Panama’s key objectives, as was carrying out pilot projects like the one at Hato Chami school. “We knew we had to raise awareness around solar,” said Jesús Gonzalez, project manager of Termosolar Panama. “There was no real understanding in Panama that fossil fuels were used to heat water, or the amount of hot water that could be produced. We also knew we needed to prove it worked, which is why pilot projects are so important.” Termosolar Panama has deployed 430 square metres of solar water heaters. Alongside Hato Chami school, they were installed in health facilities, including three large hospitals, hotels, factories, farms and homes. The project focused on developing local skills and supply chains. As a result, all installations were done by local workers. “It was important to us that the technology could be implemented by local suppliers,” said Gonzalez. “Not only [will that] create jobs but, more importantly, technology know-how has been developed locally, either for installing or manufacturing solar thermal systems.” At the Hato Chami school, the installation of solar water heaters was done together with , a social purpose organization that began by using surfing to help at-risk children develop social, academic and physical skills. “Hot water is one of the easiest things to make sustainable, through solar thermal.” During the pandemic, Waved founder Bastian Barnbeck noticed the Hato Chami school kitchen was rundown and ill-equipped. Cooks were using large amounts of wood, which was bad for the environment, and heating water was ineffective and slow. Waved set out to build a new kitchen and reached out to the Termosolar Panama project team. Termosolar decided that Waved’s community-led approach would make a good pilot project, and it donated and installed the equipment. “We listened to the community and their needs and designed something that worked for them,” said Barnbeck, “Not only was the new kitchen easier to use but it was better for the environment.” Barnbeck believes it is this community-led approach that has made Termosolar Panama a success, a sentiment echoed by Lindo, who helped launch the project and believes it has regional and international appeal. The success of Termosolar Panama demonstrates the viability of solar thermal as an alternate fuel to help lower the country’s dependence of liquefied petroleum gas. According to a , replacing this fuel with renewable energy could create over 93,000 jobs in Panama by 2050, or 133,000 if part of the technology was built locally. If Panama switched to entirely renewable energy, carbon dioxide emissions could fall by 91 per cent by 2050, also reducing Panama’s energy costs by US$22 billion. Moving towards renewable energy, such as solar thermal, could bring the wider Latin America and Caribbean region a net benefit of US$1.3 billion by 2050, or about 20 per cent of the 2019 regional GDP. “Termosolar Panama is helping bring thermal heating to the attention of Panamanians,” Colville said. “It is offering solutions that will help us reduce emissions and save money, but this project provides an example that can be replicated globally.” © 2024 UNEP"

        "content": "Every year, humanity clears of forests, an area equivalent to the size of Portugal. The loss of these ecosystems is devastating for and the who rely on forests for food, water and other essentials. But deforestation has another, often-overlooked peril: it is stoking climate change. The felling of trees in tropical areas alone releases more than of planet-warming greenhouse gasses every year. That is more than four times the combined total of aviation and shipping. As countries prepare to update their national climate pledges in 2025, a key part of the landmark on climate change, experts are urging them to include concrete targets to end deforestation and restore forests. Without those provisions, experts say, countries will be hard pressed to rein in a climate crisis that is and unleashing of around the world. “Not only do forests support rich biodiversity and provide for human societies and economies but they play a vital role in stabilizing our climate,” says Mirey Atallah, head of the Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience branch of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “If we are to have any hope of slowing climate change, we must halt deforestation.” Here is a closer look at how forests can counter the climate crisis. Trees are some of the planet’s most important warehouses of carbon, absorbing the element from the air via photosynthesis, and storing it in their leaves, roots and trunks. But when trees decay or are burned, they release stored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. This is a greenhouse gas that traps heat near the Earth’s surface, raising temperatures and propelling climate change. At the same time, the loss of trees means forests are no longer able to absorb as much carbon from the air as before, a double hit for the climate. Human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, are pushing greenhouse gas emissions to , sparking climatic upheaval, including flooding, droughts and wildfires. These catastrophes and cause trillions of dollars in economic losses each year. And they are poised to get worse. UNEP data shows that based on current national commitments, the planet this century, well above the goals of the Paris Agreement and enough to trigger widespread . Cutting emissions quickly by saving and restoring forests is considered vital. A big one. To keep global warming below 1.5°C, a key goal of the Paris Agreement, the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions by annually by 2030. Halting deforestation could reduce emissions by , according to the , a partnership between UNEP, the UN Development Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. Protecting and restoring forests is one of many nature-based solutions that countries can use to limit greenhouse gas emissions. found these strategies could help cut emissions anywhere from 10 gigatonnes to 18 gigatonnes a year by 2050. No. Driven by the expansion of agriculture, deforestation continues at a breakneck pace. The world has lost of forests since 1990, found the Food and Agriculture Organization. That is an area about half the size of China. From 2015-2020, the rate of deforestation was 10 million hectares a year, an area about the size of Portugal. All 195 signatories of the climate treaty adopted in 2015 must submit Nationally Determined Contributions. These climate plans outline how countries are going to reduce emissions and can include everything from investments in renewable energy to the promotion of more sustainable farming practices. Despite the climate-change-fighting ability of forests, only 40 per cent of the most deforestation-prone countries have measures to protect forests in their nationally determined contributions, found a . With a new round of pledges due in 2025, Atallah says this is a “golden opportunity” for policymakers to incorporate concrete targets for protecting and restoring forests. The first step is to set clearly defined targets for stopping deforestation and restoring forests within nationally determined contributions, says Atallah. The often-complex drivers of deforestation, including resource extraction and the unchecked expansion of agriculture, will require national dialogues and trade-offs. National climate plans should also consider the diverse perspectives of Indigenous Peoples, rural communities, women and young people, found the UN-REDD report. Developing countries, which are home to the vast majority of deforestation, also need technical and financial support to live up to their commitments to protect forests. UNEP is working with countries to ensure that payments for forests, be those from the development community or from carbon markets, reflect the true value of forest ecosystems and provide a meaningful funding flow to developing countries. According to a , forest carbon prices should rapidly climb to US$30-US$50 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to have impact. Currently, they are at or below US$10 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is by any measure, way less than it costs to maintain forests. “We are running out of time to tackle the climate crisis,” says Atallah. “If countries do not make real progress in protecting forests and cutting emissions with this round of nationally determined contributions, it may be too late to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.” © 2024 UNEP"

Forests have a mitigation potential of over 5 GtCO2e per year by halting forest loss and degradation, and sustainable forest management, conservation and restoration (REDD+). REDD+ is a climate change mitigation solution developed by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Its framework, the so-called Warsaw Framework was adopted in 2013 at COP 19 in Warsaw and provides the methodological and financing guidance for the implementation of REDD+ activities. The Paris Climate Agreement recognizes REDD+ and the central role of forests in Article 5. REDD+ reduces deforestation through the conservation and sustainable management of forests and supporting developing countries in turning their political commitments, as represented in their Nationally Determined Contributions, into action on the ground. Forests mitigate climate change because of their capacity to remove carbon from the atmosphere and to store it in biomass and soils. When forests are cleared or degraded, they can become a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by releasing that stored carbon. It is estimated that globally, deforestation and forest degradation account for around 11 percent of CO2 emissions. To date, 118 countries have included forest and land use in their Nationally Determined Contributions pledges. This represents 162 million hectares of restored, reforested and afforested land, which is in line with the Bonn Challenge and the New York Declaration on Forests. Since 2008 the UN-REDD Programme (UNEP, FAO and UNDP) has been supporting 65 partner countries in their nationally led efforts to become “REDD+ ready” and qualify for results-based payments. As of today, UN-REDD countries have submitted forest emissions reductions equal to taking 150 million cars off the road for a year. And UN-REDD has channeled and mobilized more than USD 1 billion since inception. Within the UN-REDD Programme, UNEP leads on private sector engagement, safeguards, knowledge management and communications. Key facts  During 2015–2020, the rate of deforestation was estimated at 10 million hectares per year. Currently 11% of all carbon emissions stem from deforestation – more than emissions from all means of transport combined. Limiting climate change to well below 2C cannot be achieved without REDD+. Halting deforestation and forest degradation can avoid emissions of more than 5 gigatons CO2e/year. Forest conservation and restoration can provide more than one quarter of the emissions reductions needed in the next two decades. The goals of the Paris Agreement cannot be met without the world's forests: their mitigation potential by 2030 is about 5 gigatons/year, on par with that of industry and only behind the energy sector. Forests, however, are more than that. Protecting the world's forests is crucial to meet the Sustainable Development Goals: they provide an array of critically important ecosystem services including habitat for biodiversity of global significance and livelihoods for vulnerable and indigenous communities. Forests and woodlands are important stores of planet-warming carbon dioxide, soaking up 30 per cent of emissions from industry and fossil fuels. But every year, the world loses 10 million hectares of forests, an area larger than Portugal. Deforestation and forest degradation account for approximately 11 percent of carbon emissions. If deforestation were a country, it would rank third in carbon dioxide emissions behind China and the United States of America. An annual outlay of $1 million in forest management can generate from 500 to 1,000 jobs in many developing countries, and 20 to 100 in most developed and middle-income countries. Investments in forests can become a backbone for COVID-19 recovery efforts in rural economies in developing countries. For more information visit UN-REDD or learn more about UNEP's work on forests.",

The difference between these two values is known as the ‘emissions gap’. In line with previous editions, the report highlights key opportunities to bridge this gap. This edition of the report presents an overview of options for enhancing the ambition of NDCs, while strengthening actions through a suite of domestic policies tackling climate change. Next to the role of governments it also assesses the role of non-state and subnational actors in bridging the emissions gap, examines the role of fiscal policy reform in creating incentives for low carbon investments and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and assesses how acceleration of innovative approaches can help bridge the emissions gap, while simultaneously transforming societies. The Emissions Gap Report 2018 finds that it is still possible to keep global warming below 2°C, but the technical feasibility of bridging the 1.5°C gap is dwindling. Global carbon dioxide emissions increased in 2017, after a three-year period of stabilization. If the emissions gap is not closed by 2030, it is extremely unlikely that the 2°C temperature goal can still be reached. © 2024 UNEP"

It analyses adaptation finance against the background of the provisions laid out in the Paris Agreement, and benefits from the insights included in the NDCs © 2024 UNEP"

        "content": "This is the fourth edition of the UN Environment Adaptation Gap Reports. Since 2014, these reports have focused on exploring adaptation gaps, characterized as the difference between the actual level of adaptation and the level required to achieve a societal goal. The adoption of the Paris Agreement established a global goal on adaptation of “enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view to contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation response in the context of the temperature goal”. As the Paris Agreement is now being implemented, important decisions are about to be made on how to report on, and take stock of, progress towards this global goal. The Adaptation Gap Reports focus on providing policy-relevant information to support such efforts. The focus of the 2018 report is dual: The examines the gaps that exist in a number of areas that are central to taking stock and assessing progress on adaptation, namely the enabling environment as expressed through laws and policies, key development aspects of adaptive capacity, and the costs of and finance needed for adaptation. The of the report focuses on the adaptation gap in one particular sector, namely . Based on the available scientific evidence on climate impacts and health outcomes, the second part provides an overview of the global adaptation gap in health, followed by a specific focus on three key areas of climate-related health risks: heat and extreme events, climate-sensitive infectious diseases, and food and nutritional security © 2024 UNEP"

INC Media Team ( ) in-person meetings, Bangkok, Thailand 24 - 28 August 2024 from IISD: Earth Negotiations Bulletin | – The of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment (INC-4), concluded today in Ottawa with an advanced draft text of the instrument and agreement on intersessional work ahead of the (INC-5) in November. More than 2,500 delegates participated in INC-4, representing 170 Members and over 480 Observer organizations including - non-governmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, and UN entities. INC-4 marked the Committee's largest and most inclusive gathering to date, with Observer participation increasing by almost fifty per cent. Over the course of INC-4, worked on negotiating the of the international legally binding instrument. Delegates discussed, among other things: emissions and releases; production; product design; waste management; problematic and avoidable plastics; financing, and a just transition. INC Members also agreed on intersessional work – expert meetings that take place between the official INC sessions – that is expected to catalyze convergence on key issues. In addition, Members decided to create an Open-ended Legal Drafting Group to form at INC-5, serving in an advisory capacity by reviewing elements of the draft revised text to ensure legal soundness. “We came to Ottawa to advance the text and with the hope that Members would agree on the intersessional work required to make even greater progress ahead of INC-5. We leave Ottawa having achieved both goals and a clear path to landing an ambitious deal in Busan ahead of us,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). “The work, however, is far from over. The plastic pollution crisis continues to engulf the world and we have just a few months left before the end of year deadline agreed upon in 2022. I urge members to show continued commitment and flexibility to achieve maximum ambition.” The fourth session follows INC-1 in Punta del Este in November 2022, INC-2 in Paris in May/June 2023, and INC-3 in Nairobi in November 2023. INC-5 – set to be the end of the INC process – is scheduled for November 2024 in Busan, the Republic of Korea. “Canada is committed to reaching a final agreement at INC-5 in the Republic of Korea before year end. We are no longer talking about “if” we can get there, but “how.” Together we can land one of the most significant environmental decisions since the Paris Agreement and the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework,” said said Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “We are doing everything we can to raise the international profile of the plastic pollution crisis so that the agreement gets the global attention it deserves to cross the finish line.” The Chair of the INC, Ambassador Luis Vayas said: “During these seven days of intense deliberations, you – the delegates – have managed to build on and advance the revised draft text of the instrument, providing streamlined text and entering textual negotiations on several elements,” Ambassador Vayas said. “At the same time, we also leave with a much clearer picture of the work that remains to be done, if we are to deliver on the promise that Members have made through UNEA Resolution 5/14.” “We are all united by our strong shared commitment to deliver an international legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution. It is this spirit of multilateralism which has guided our discussions here in Ottawa,” he added. “We have found some common ground, and we are walking this path together until the end. I firmly believe that we can carry this same spirit forth to Busan to deliver on our mandate.” Ambassador Vayas thanked the Government of Canada for hosting the session, as well as the Committee Members, Observers, co-facilitators, support staff, and the INC Secretariat, and his team. “It has been an ambitious timeline of just 18 months and four sessions to get us to this point, and we are now firmly on the road to Busan. Compromise and commitment remains strong at this advanced stage of the negotiations,” said Jyoti Mathur-Filipp, Executive Secretary of the INC Secretariat. “Members should arrive in Busan ready to deliver on their mandate and agree a final text of the instrument. This is more than a process – it is the fulfilment of your commitment to saving future generations from the global scourge of plastic pollution.” United Nations Environment Assembly requested the Executive Director of UNEP to convene an intergovernmental negotiating committee, to begin its work during the second half of 2022, with the ambition of completing its work by the end of 2024. The INC is tasked with developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, henceforth referred to as “the instrument”, which could include both binding and voluntary approaches, based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic. – The fourth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment (INC-4), opened today in Canada’s capital, Ottawa. The session aims to advance negotiations so that the Committee can finalize, at its in November, the text of the instrument. Members will also decide on intersessional work – informal INC sessions taking place between the official meetings – required between the INC-4 and INC-5, to support the further development of the text. INC-4 is the penultimate stage of the negotiations; it follows three earlier rounds of negotiations: INC-1, which took place in Punta del Este, in November 2022, INC-2, which was held in Paris in June 2023, and INC-3, which happened in Nairobi in November 2023. “We are seeing convergence on eliminating the uses that are problematic and avoidable. We will continue to need plastic for specific uses, such as renewable energy technologies. But there is growing agreement that short-lived and single use can go,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme. “We can be proud of what we have achieved. But a job half-done is a job not done. Time is against us – both in terms of finalizing the instrument and how much more the planet can take. As we deliberate, plastic pollution continues to gush into ecosystems,” she added. “So, I ask for INC-4 to show energy, commitment, collaboration, and ambition. To make progress. And set the stage for INC-5 to finalize an instrument that will end plastic pollution, once and for all.” INC-5, to be held in Busan, the Republic of Korea, from 25 November to 1 December 2024, is intended as the end of the INC process. It will be followed by a Diplomatic Conference where Heads of State will sign the agreement. “We are here seeking to advance these negotiations and deliver a treaty because collectively we have recognized that multilateral cooperation – this INC process, a new legally binding international instrument – have a critical role to play in providing the effective and impactful solutions needed to end plastic pollution. The spirit of multilateralism is: “together, we are stronger”,” said Luis Vayas Valdivieso, Chair of the INC. “Let us negotiate with accountability and integrity –grounded in the scientific evidence and facts on the scale and urgency of ending plastic pollution. Let us also approach this task with optimism, that it is both necessary and possible for us to achieve this new treaty,” he added. The start of INC-4 was preceded by regional consultations and a conversation with Observers, and Canada hosted a Partnerships Day and a Ministerial Day on the sidelines of the session. “Agreeing to a global agreement on plastic pollution by the end of 2024 would mark one of the most significant environmental decisions and would be a first-of-its-kind agreement to unite the world around a shared goal to end plastic pollution,” said Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “Canada has put in place a number of measures to stem the tide of plastic pollution at home, and we are keen to keep up the momentum for a global agreement that aligns with our ambition. We welcome delegations, partners, and stakeholders from around the world to Ottawa for INC-4 to continue the ambitious work needed to achieve this united goal.” At the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly in February 2024, Canada convened the other host countries of the INC process – France, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, and Uruguay – for a Ministerial meeting, under the umbrella of the Host Country Alliance, to galvanize momentum toward the global instrument. “Seize this opportunity, make these seven days count, deliver a text that is as close as possible to the final agreement that we all want to see,” said Jyoti Mathur- Filipp, Executive Secretary of the INC. “You delegates know the issues that need to be addressed at this session, and that flexibility will be needed to reach consensus. This is the only way forward.” United Nations Environment Assembly requested the Executive Director of UNEP to convene an intergovernmental negotiating committee, to begin its work during the second half of 2022, with the ambition of completing its work by the end of 2024. The INC is tasked with developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, which could include both binding and voluntary approaches, based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic.

The full life cycle. This means rethinking everything along the chain, from polymer to pollution, from product to packaging,” she added. “We need to use fewer virgin materials, less plastic and no harmful chemicals. We need to ensure that we use, reuse, and recycle resources more efficiently. And dispose safely of what is left over. And use these negotiations to hone a sharp and incisive instrument to carve out a better future, free from plastic pollution.” “We now have had the opportunity to have the first round of discussion on all elements of the future instrument,” Chair of the INC, Gustavo Adolfo Meza-Cuadra Velasquez, said. “It is my hope that by the end of the session, the Committee will agree on a mandate for a revised draft and possible intersessional work to prepare for that fourth and fifth sessions,” he added. “I am confident that we can make substantive progress here at our third session and capitalise on the Nairobi spirit, consensus and ambition.” The start of INC-3 was preceded by a on 11 November, also in Nairobi, during which delegates engaged in initial, informal exchanges of views, as well as regional consultations on 12 November.

Some examples of how the Secretariat endeavoured to engage stakeholders throughout the process include: Some of the options the committee is considering include: from IISD: Earth Negotiations Bulletin. – Over 2,500 in-person and virtual delegates from 147 countries, engaged in the . The meeting set the foundation to shape the global instrument to end plastic pollution, with many governments confirming their desire to have an instrument that addresses the full life cycle of plastics, protecting human health and the environment, with special attention paid to the unique circumstances of those countries most in need. expressing that knowledge, shared responsibilities and optimism are key elements on the road ahead for negotiators. , “We must eliminate and substitute problematic and unnecessary plastic items and ensure that plastic products are designed to be reusable or recyclable. Important that we find our way towards an ambitious multilateral instrument that ensures plastic products are circulated in practice, not just in theory.” She went on to emphasize: “To get this done, the deal must cover the full life cycle: from considering different types of polymers and plastic products to developing safe and environmentally sound waste management. Crucially, we must ensure that these actions take into account the principles of a just transition so that nobody is left behind.” Several delegates indicated the instrument should take a combined approach with legally binding core obligations, control measures and voluntary elements to address the entire plastics lifecycle. Furthermore, many delegates emphasized the need to ensure strong monitoring and reporting mechanisms as part of the success of the future instrument. In summarizing the discussions, INC Chair Ambassador Gustavo Meza-Cuadra (Peru) stated: “‘It is clear that we have started to see areas of convergence in the development of the future instrument.” Jyoti Mathur-Filipp, INC Secretariat Executive Secretary, indicated that the outcome of the first session is a mandate that is deeply crucial in moving towards developing a draft text for the instrument within two years. She stressed the need for an ambitious and meaningful outcome of the INC process. The deliberations were preceded by a which opened on 26 November with around 900 participants taking place in person and online. that plastics are one of the biggest examples of unsustainable consumption and production, of “use and throw away,” with harmful implications for human health and the environment and announced the country's new return deposit system for plastic packaging. Finally, INC Chair, Ambassador Gustavo Meza-Cuadra called for broad and inclusive participation in this process, without losing sight of the ultimate objective, to protect the environment and human health from the impacts of plastic pollution. The next session, INC-2, will be held in Paris, France the week of 22 May 2023. Countries are expected to build on the outcomes of Punta del Este, Uruguay and begin negotiating on the options for elements towards an international legally binding instrument, based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastics as called for by . UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment. It provides leadership and encourages partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations. In February 2022, at the resumed fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-5.2), a historic resolution (5/14) was adopted to develop a legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, with the ambition to complete the negotiations by end of 2024. The instrument is to be based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic. , Media Officer, UN Environment Programme from IISD: Earth Negotiations Bulletin INC Secretariat: Registration enquiries: Media enquiries: to prevent harassment, including sexual harassment, at UN System events. © 2024 UNEP"

        "meta_description": "The United Nations Core Values—integrity, professionalism and respect for diversity—are shared principles and beliefs that underpin the work of UNEP and guide the actions and behaviour of personnel.  UNEP personnel are required to   Become acquainted and comply with the relevant policies, rules and regulations,  Demonstrate zero tolerance for prohibited conduct by themselves and others,   Raise awareness and take action if they witness prohibited conduct, for example, by reporting prohibited conduct, and  Undertake relevant mandatory and non-mandatory training.  Prohibited conduct Prohibited conduct refers to a staff member’s failure to comply with United Nations regulations, rules and internal policies.  The following United Nations rules, regulations and administrative issuances address prohibited conduct: ST/SGB/2018/1/REV.1 – Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2002/13 – Status, Basic Rights and Duties of United Nations Staff Members ST/AI/2017/1 – Unsatisfactory conduct, investigation and the disciplinary process ST/SGB/2018/1 – Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2019/8 – Addressing discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment and abuse of authority Acts that constitute prohibited conduct include, but are not limited, to the following: Sexual harassment, Sexual exploitation and abuse Harassment: Harassment is any unwelcome conduct that might reasonably be expected or perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another person when such conduct interferes with work or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions intended to annoy, alarm, abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another. Discrimination: Discrimination is any unfair treatment or arbitrary distinction based on a person’s race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, disability, age, language, social origin or other similar shared characteristic or trait. Fraud and corruption: Fraud encompasses any act or omission whereby an individual or entity knowingly misrepresents or conceals a material fact in order to obtain an undue benefit or advantage for himself, herself, itself or a third party, or to cause another to act to his or her detriment. Corruption refers to any act or omission that misuses official authority or seeks to influence the misuse of official authority in order to obtain an undue benefit for oneself or a third party. Fraudulent acts are any intentional misconduct that misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party to obtain a financial benefit or other benefit or to avoid an obligation and seek to evade detection. Abuse of authority: Abuse of authority is the improper use of a position of influence, power or authority against another person. This is particularly serious when a person uses their influence, power or authority to improperly influence the career or employment conditions of another, including, but not limited to, appointment, assignment, contract renewal, performance evaluation, working conditions or promotion. Other prohibited conduct includes unauthorised outside activities, misrepresentation, forgery, false certification or failure to disclose a material fact in connection with United Nations claims and benefits, acts or omissions in conflict with the general obligations of a staff member, misuse of United Nationsvproperty, medical and dental fraud, and misuse of office, including breach of confidentiality and abuse of privileges and immunities. Reporting prohibited conduct Information about possible prohibited conduct may be brought to the attention of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) Investigation hotline or the Executive Director of UNEP (with a copy to OIOS). A formal report should be detailed enough to allow for a review of the report. All anonymous reports should be filed with OIOS. All reports of possible prohibited conduct are reviewed through a preliminary assessment to decide on the need for an investigation. OIOS, or UNEP, investigates reports of possible prohibited conduct through fact-finding panels, which are set up to make findings of fact that will help others determine whether prohibited conduct took place. A disciplinary process is conducted, following which disciplinary measures are implemented. Procedure for addressing prohibited conduct 1. Receipt of the complaint by UNEP or OIOS The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), through its Investigations Division (OIOS/ID), retains the ultimate authority to review all complaints about unsatisfactory conduct. In view of this, UNEP is required to transfer all complaints received to OIOS/ID. OIOS/ID must then decide whether to review  and investigate the complaint or refer it to UNEP for appropriate action – such as conducting a preliminary assessment, taking interim administrative and managerial actions, and requesting assistance from the Ombudsman’s office to conduct mediation or coaching. There is no timeline for this phase of the process. 2. Preliminary assessment and investigation by UNEP Upon receipt of a referral from OIOS/ID, UNEP conducts a preliminary assessment. The purpose of the preliminary assessment is to determine whether an investigation should be initiated. A preliminary assessment is not a formal investigation process and does not require investigators.  It is primarily carried out by the Corporate Services Division/Legal Section or Corporate Services Division/Human Resources Section of UNEP, under the supervision of the UNEP Executive Director. Following the preliminary assessment, Corporate Services Division recommends actions to be taken, whether case  closure, administrative or managerial actions, or the initiation of an investigation.  The Executive Director makes the decision to initiate an investigation, based on a recommendation from the Corporate Services Division. The timeline to conduct a preliminary assessment is three months. 3. Investigation If a decision is made to investigate a report of possible unsatisfactory conduct, the Executive Director  will appoint a fact-finding panel.  The fact-finding panel comprises OIOS/ID-trained United Nations staff members,  staff members with prior investigation experience, or retired staff members who have conducted workplace investigations and have received OIOS/ID training. Under  ST/SGB/2019/8 - Addressing discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment and abuse of authority, the Executive Director is required to appoint OIOS/ID-trained investigators to a fact-finding panel for complaints of harassment, abuse of authority, or discrimination. Other reports of unsatisfactory conduct listed in ST/AI/2017/1-Unsatisfactory conduct, investigation and the disciplinary process can be handled by trained investigators and/or current or retired United Nations staff members with prior investigation experience. Investigations conducted by fact-finding panels appointed by the Executive Director should comply with the Investigators' Toolkit. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance (DMSPC) maintains a roster of investigators who have been trained by OIOS/ID across the United Nations. Investigators on the roster can serve as investigators for any United Nations entity in need of one.  The UNEP roster currently includes 13 trained investigators. Investigators are appointed only for the purpose of a fact-finding investigation, either by OIOS/ID or by the Executive Director. Following an investigation, the fact-finding panel must prepare an investigation report to document the findings. Upon completion of the investigation, the fact-finding panel submits the report to the Executive Director. The Executive Director reviews the investigation report, following an investigation conducted by the fact-finding panel, and decides whether the reported conduct is found to be substantiated, may amount to misconduct and should, therefore, be referred to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources (ASG/OHR) for further review and disciplinary process as necessary. If the conduct is not substantiated by facts, the matter will be closed. The Executive Director will also decide whether to take managerial or administrative action. 4. Timeline  It takes one month to set up the fact-finding panel after the decision to launch an investigation is reached.  There is no time limit for the investigation. 5. Disciplinary process Upon referral of the investigation report by OIOS/ID or UNEP, the ASG/OHR reviews to decide whether to initiate a disciplinary process, should the facts indicate that the conduct of the alleged offender may amount to misconduct. There is no timeline for the review of the investigation report by the ASG/OHR. If the ASG/OHR initiates a disciplinary process, the alleged offender is provided with formal allegations of misconduct, together with the investigation report and supporting documentation. The alleged offender is entitled to seek legal advice and provide comments. Further investigation by the ASG/OHR may be necessary.  Upon receipt of formal allegations, the staff member has one month to respond. Upon conclusion of the disciplinary process, the ASG/OHR may (a) Close the case with no action, (b) Refer the case to the Executive Director for managerial or administrative action and/or (c) Recommend to the Under-Secretary-General for Management (USG) to (a) Decide that the facts are established to the requisite standard of proof, (b) Impose disciplinary measures if the facts have been established and the behaviour amounts to misconduct, (c) Take administrative or managerial action where necessary, and (d) Decide on recovery of financial loss to the organisation in full or in part. ASG/OHR informs the affected individual of the decision of the USG following the disciplinary process, with a copy to the Executive Director of UNEP.   Retaliation/Whistleblowing 1. Protection against retaliation/whistleblowing According to ST/SGB/2017/2 REV. 1 - Protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct and for cooperating with duly authorized audits or investigations, retaliation is any direct or indirect detrimental action recommended, threatened or taken against an individual who officially reported misconduct or otherwise cooperated with duly authorised audits or investigations. If established, retaliation constitutes misconduct, which is subject to possible sanction. Pursuant to the Secretary-General’s Bulletin (SGB), the United Nations Ethics Office reviews requests for protection. The bulletin encourages individuals to report fraud, corruption and other potential misconduct without the fear of retaliation. Whistleblowers can file reports anonymously to OIOS. The SGB enhances protection for those who report misconduct (any violation of the organisation’s regulations and rules by staff members) or wrongdoing (by any person that would be harmful to the interests, operations or governance of the United Nations), and for those who cooperate with duly authorised audits or investigations. The ability to report misconduct or wrongdoing without fear of retaliation is a critical element to building an organisational culture of integrity, transparency and accountability. A request for protection against retaliation should be submitted to the United Nations Ethics Office within six months of becoming aware of the retaliation. 2. Procedure  Requests for protection against retaliation or whistleblower reports should be made by anyone who has reported misconduct or participated in an investigation or audit and believes that he/she/they have been retaliated against. In such a case, the concerned individual(s) should contact the United Nations Ethics Office. The United Nations Ethics Office is responsible for enforcing the anti-retaliation policy, which protects those who report wrongdoing. The United Nations Ethics Office conducts “preliminary reviews” of retaliation complaints to ascertain whether a prima facie case of retaliation exists. Such a preliminary review is not considered an investigation. However, if the Ethics Office finds a prima facie case of retaliation, it then refers the matter to OIOS. OIOS conducts a full investigation, through setting up a fact-finding panel and gathering facts from different concerned persons.  At the conclusion of the fact-finding investigation, OIOS transmits the findings to the United Nations Ethics Office for review and action. The United Nations Ethics Office makes the final decision after reviewing the investigation report. Upon its recommendation, the UNEP may be requested to take administrative or managerial actions. The process of addressing protection from retaliation/whistleblowing has been isolated from the concerned United Nations entity and will be handled by the UN Ethics Office to ensure impartiality in the review of such complaints. The United Nations Ethics Office produces annual reports of its activities to the Secretary-General. Information on the activities of the United Nations Ethics Office, including the number of reports received for  protection against retaliation, can be viewed online. Fraud and corruption UNEP has adopted a zero-tolerance approach to misconduct – including fraud and corruption involving its staff members, other United Nations personnel or third parties in relation to their work with UNEP. “Zero tolerance” means that UNEP will pursue all allegations of fraudulent acts involving any individual or entity covered by UN regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies and procedures. The appropriate administrative/disciplinary measures or contractual remedies will be applied if fraudulent acts are substantiated in accordance with UN procedures concerning prohibited conduct. Furthermore, UNEP may, where deemed appropriate, recover loss suffered by the organisation or refer matters involving credible allegations of criminal fraudulent acts to national authorities. The United Nations has established a dedicated framework on fraud and corruption in ST/IC/2016/25 - Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat (the “Framework”). The Framework promotes a culture of integrity and honesty within the organisation by providing information to staff members on how to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and corruption. UNEP has translated the Framework into the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Guidelines (UNEP AFAC Guidelines), which aims to strengthen the organisation’s prevention of and response to incidents of fraud and corruption by providing: Concrete and practical advice to UNEP staff members in identifying potential risk areas; A clear and user-friendly guide and reference for both external and internal audiences for awareness of controls put in place by UNEP, which are aimed at monitoring fraud and corruption; and A consolidated procedure for sanctioning fraud and corruption. On 9 December 2022, United Nations Under-Secretary-General Ms Catherine Pollard launched the Secretariat’s “Fraud and Corruption Awareness Handbook.” This helps staff understand how fraud and corruption can manifest in the various processes and functions of the Secretariat. It includes case studies reflecting some of the most common types of fraud and corruption experienced in the organisation, as well as red flags and indicators that may point to the possible presence of fraud and corruption. In addition, it contains references to mechanisms and channels for reporting fraud and corruption, as well as highlights of the process of investigations and imposition of sanctions. The Handbook is available in English and French. How to report fraud and corruption Reporting fraud and corruption follows the same procedure as reporting other prohibited conduct. Confidentiality of the process The process for dealing with prohibited conduct is confidential in order to protect the integrity of the process and the rights of those involved. To the greatest extent possible, the identities of complainants and witnesses are kept confidential and only disclosed to those who have a legitimate reason to know about the process.

        "content": "The United Nations —integrity, professionalism and respect for diversity—are shared principles and beliefs that underpin the work of UNEP and guide the actions and behaviour of personnel. UNEP personnel are required to Become acquainted and comply with the relevant policies, rules and regulations, Demonstrate zero tolerance for prohibited conduct by themselves and others, Raise awareness and take action if they witness prohibited conduct, for example, by reporting prohibited conduct, and Undertake relevant mandatory and non-mandatory training. Prohibited conduct refers to a staff member’s failure to comply with United Nations regulations, rules and internal policies. The following United Nations rules, regulations and administrative issuances address prohibited conduct: Acts that constitute prohibited conduct include, but are not limited, to the following: Information about possible prohibited conduct may be brought to the attention of the or the of UNEP (with a copy to OIOS). A formal report should be detailed enough to allow for a review of the report. All anonymous reports should be filed with OIOS. All reports of possible prohibited conduct are reviewed through a preliminary assessment to decide on the need for an investigation. OIOS, or UNEP, investigates reports of possible prohibited conduct through fact-finding panels, which are set up to make findings of fact that will help others determine whether prohibited conduct took place. A disciplinary process is conducted, following which disciplinary measures are implemented. The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), through its Investigations Division (OIOS/ID), retains the ultimate authority to review all complaints about unsatisfactory conduct. In view of this, UNEP is required to transfer all complaints received to OIOS/ID. OIOS/ID must then decide whether to review and investigate the complaint or refer it to UNEP for appropriate action – such as conducting a preliminary assessment, taking interim administrative and managerial actions, and requesting assistance from the Ombudsman’s office to conduct mediation or coaching. There is no timeline for this phase of the process. Upon receipt of a referral from OIOS/ID, UNEP conducts a preliminary assessment. The purpose of the preliminary assessment is to determine whether an investigation should be initiated. A preliminary assessment is not a formal investigation process and does not require investigators. It is primarily carried out by the Corporate Services Division/Legal Section or Corporate Services Division/Human Resources Section of UNEP, under the supervision of the UNEP Executive Director. Following the preliminary assessment, Corporate Services Division recommends actions to be taken, whether case closure, administrative or managerial actions, or the initiation of an investigation. The Executive Director makes the decision to initiate an investigation, based on a recommendation from the Corporate Services Division. The timeline to conduct a preliminary assessment is three months. If a decision is made to investigate a report of possible unsatisfactory conduct, the Executive Director will appoint a fact-finding panel. The fact-finding panel comprises OIOS/ID-trained United Nations staff members, staff members with prior investigation experience, or retired staff members who have conducted workplace investigations and have received OIOS/ID training. Under , the Executive Director is required to appoint OIOS/ID-trained investigators to a fact-finding panel for complaints of harassment, abuse of authority, or discrimination. Other reports of unsatisfactory conduct listed in ST/AI/2017/1- can be handled by trained investigators and/or current or retired United Nations staff members with prior investigation experience. Investigations conducted by fact-finding panels appointed by the Executive Director should comply with the . The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance (DMSPC) maintains a roster of investigators who have been trained by OIOS/ID across the United Nations. Investigators on the roster can serve as investigators for any United Nations entity in need of one. The UNEP roster currently includes 13 trained investigators. Investigators are appointed only for the purpose of a fact-finding investigation, either by OIOS/ID or by the Executive Director. Following an investigation, the fact-finding panel must prepare an investigation report to document the findings. Upon completion of the investigation, the fact-finding panel submits the report to the Executive Director. The Executive Director reviews the investigation report, following an investigation conducted by the fact-finding panel, and decides whether the reported conduct is found to be substantiated, may amount to misconduct and should, therefore, be referred to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources (ASG/OHR) for further review and disciplinary process as necessary. If the conduct is not substantiated by facts, the matter will be closed. The Executive Director will also decide whether to take managerial or administrative action. It takes one month to set up the fact-finding panel after the decision to launch an investigation is reached. There is no time limit for the investigation. Upon referral of the investigation report by OIOS/ID or UNEP, the ASG/OHR reviews to decide whether to initiate a disciplinary process, should the facts indicate that the conduct of the alleged offender may amount to misconduct. There is no timeline for the review of the investigation report by the ASG/OHR. If the ASG/OHR initiates a disciplinary process, the alleged offender is provided with formal allegations of misconduct, together with the investigation report and supporting documentation. The alleged offender is entitled to seek legal advice and provide comments. Further investigation by the ASG/OHR may be necessary. Upon receipt of formal allegations, the staff member has one month to respond. Upon conclusion of the disciplinary process, the ASG/OHR may (a) Close the case with no action, (b) Refer the case to the Executive Director for managerial or administrative action and/or (c) Recommend to the Under-Secretary-General for Management (USG) to (a) Decide that the facts are established to the requisite standard of proof, (b) Impose disciplinary measures if the facts have been established and the behaviour amounts to misconduct, (c) Take administrative or managerial action where necessary, and (d) Decide on recovery of financial loss to the organisation in full or in part.

        "meta_description": "The Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme, at its twenty-seventh and first universal session held in February 2013, in paragraph 17 of decision 27/2, decided to enhance transparency and openness in its work, and in this regard requested the Executive Director to establish a written access-to-information policy.Subsequently, the Executive Director established the UNEP Access-to-Information Policy on 6 June 2014, which was implemented on an interim basis. Having undertaken a process of its review, the Executive Director establishes the present Policy that supersedes the above-mentioned interim policy.The Executive Director recognizes that in order for UNEP to fully carry out its mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly in its resolution 2997 (XXVII) and other relevant resolutions, it is critically important to disseminate and make accessible the information concerning its work or information generated through its programme, in particular with respect to environmental information as widely as possible. In particular, in the context of Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, it is of fundamental importance for UNEP to make environmental information available to Member States, other stakeholders and the public in general with a view to supporting their efforts in achieving sustainable development.For the purpose of this Policy, “environmental information” means any information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material form on:(a) The state of elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites, biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms, and the interaction among these elements;(b) Factors, such as substances, energy, noise and radiation, and activities or measures, including administrative measures, environmental agreements, policies, legislation, plans and programmes, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment within the scope of subparagraph (a) above, and cost-benefit and other economic analyses and assumptions used in environmental decision-making;(c) The state of human health and safety, conditions of human life, cultural sites and built structures, inasmuch as they are or may be affected by the state of the elements of the environment or, through these elements, by the factors, activities or measures referred to in subparagraph (b) above.At the same time, UNEP has an obligation to handle sensitive information in an appropriate manner consistent with the relevant rules and practice of the United Nations. This Policy endeavors to strike an appropriate balance between the need to grant the public maximum access to information in the UNEP’s possession, including environmental information, and UNEP’s obligation to respect the confidentiality of information regarding its Member States, partners, employees and other parties.The Policy will be reviewed and may be updated as necessary by the Executive. Such review of the Policy will be undertaken in consultation with Member States and relevant stakeholders.The PolicyUNEP is committed to making information relating to its work, in particular environmental information, available to the public.The Policy is guided by openness. Any information in the custody of UNEP, in particular information concerning the work of UNEP in accordance with its mandate given by the General Assembly in resolution 2997 (XXVII) and other relevant resolutions (such as resolutions 47/190, S-19/2 and 66/288), including environmental information generated and maintained through programmes of UNEP, is available to the public, in the absence of a compelling reason for confidentiality in line with the exceptions to the Policy listed in paragraph 5 below.Information made available to the publicThe information relating to the following functions

If a request of information is denied, the requestor may seek the review of the decision by addressing a letter to the Access-to-Information Panel established pursuant to paragraph 17 below, providing reasons for the appeal. Every request for appeals will be acknowledged. The Panel will review the denial of requests to disclose information concerned or portion of such information to a member of the public. The Executive Director will have the authority to take a final decision concerning the request for information in question. In case of rejecting an appeal, UNEP will provide the requestor with a reason for such rejection. That review should normally be completed within sixty (60) working days of being requested. The outcome of the review will be communicated to the requestor The Access-to-Information Panel is hereby established. The Panel consists of three members, all appointed by the Executive Director: two UNEP staff members and one individual, in his/her personal capacity, from outside of UNEP. Members of the Panel will be selected on the basis of the following criteria: in-depth knowledge and thorough understanding of UNEP policies, structures, programmes and operations at Headquarters, Regional and Sub-regional or Country Office levels; thorough knowledge of, and familiarity with, information disclosure and access to information policies; and proven ability to work with UNEP partners. Members will serve for a term of two years, which may be extended for another term at the discretion of the Executive Director. The Panel’s primary function is to assist the Executive Director to review appeals relating to a request for information and to determine whether the Policy has been properly applied, and to submit its conclusion and relevant recommendations to the Executive Director. In addition, the Panel assists the Executive Director to monitor the implementation of the Policy. The Panel will deliberate with the presence of three members. The Chair of the Panel will be selected from amongst, and by the Panel members. The Panel may develop, as appropriate, more detailed procedures for the review of denied requests, review the implementation of the Policy and provide recommendations on changes which should be made, as well as re-examine the Policy on a regular basis in light of operational and other changes within UNEP. The Panel will meet virtually or in situ whenever there is an appeal for review. The Panel may also meet to consider policy matters related to the Policy and its application, as necessary. In extraordinary circumstances, the Executive Director or such officials as the Executive Director so authorizes may disclose certain information covered in the list of exceptions set out in paragraph 5 above, if the overall benefits of such disclosure outweigh the potential harm to the interests protected by the exceptions. This may include situations in which the disclosure of certain confidential information would be likely to avert imminent and serious harm to public health or safety, or imminent and significant adverse impacts on the environment. Such disclosure by the Executive Director or the authorized official would be on the most restricted basis necessary to achieve the purpose of the disclosure. The disclosure of information received from a Government or a third party in confidence requires the written consent of the Government or the third party concerned. © 2024 UNEP"

The GEO assessments, and their consultative and collaborative processes, have worked to bridge the gap between science and policy by turning the best available scientific knowledge into information relevant for decision makers (UNEP 2016). Following a very successful UN Environment Assembly, the resolution on the future of the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) was approved by Member States on 2 March, 2022. The seventh edition of GEO (GEO-7) preparations began with the inaugural meetings of GEO-7, which are the ad hoc open-ended meeting of the of the GEO meeting and the . This was held on 19-22 September 2022. Experts nominated by Member States and UNEP-accredited stakeholders attended the of the seventh Global Environment Outlook. The second ad hoc open-ended meeting of the seventh Global Environment Outlook was held on 17-20 October 2022 in a hybrid format. This reviewed and adopted the draft scoping document of GEO-7. The meeting also convened expert dialogues on , and identified in GEO-6 as requiring transformation. The were presented at a side event titled \" ,\" hosted by the 9th Annual Subcommittee Meeting of UNEP's Committee of Permanent Representatives. GEO-7 proposes to build on key findings from GEO-6 and those of other significant assessments, which are: GEO-7 will also continue to assess the state and trends of the global environment, the implications for human well-being, and the achievement of the SDGs, as well as provide an outlook that provides useful guidance on the possible environmental and socio-economic consequences of the transformational changes needed. This will ensure continuity with previous GEOs and allow GEO-7 to provide some updates on the environmental impact of the global pandemic and recent disasters and conflicts. For the outlook, GEO-7 may be able to provide modelling and scenario analysis of the socio-economic effects (both positive and negative) of different solution pathways. This analysis will provide additional rationale for Member States to implement the proposed solutions pathways. These outcome documents provide an overview of the GEO-7 meeting proceedings and the key decisions taken. They are a key point of reference in the GEO-7 process. GEO-7 will focus on assessing solutions pathways for policymakers, providing them with sufficient guidance on the practical steps for policy development and adoption, implementation, timing, potential challenges, ways to assess and manage synergies, trade-offs, unintended consequences and harness the potential socio-economic benefits of these transformations. The GEO procedures were examined and adopted during an intergovernmental, multi-stakeholder, and expert meeting convened by the UNEP Executive Director from September 19 to 22, 2022, pursuant to the UN Environment Assembly resolution UNEP/EA.5/Res.3. The GEO newsletter, GEO Matters, documents the process, activities and events of the Global Environment Outlook.

For example, protecting coastal habitats like mangroves provides natural flood defences; reforestation can hold back desertification and recharge groundwater supplies in times of drought; and water bodies like rivers and lakes provide natural drainage to reduce flooding. These nature-based approaches have a significant potential to boost increase humanity’s climate resilience while simultaneously protecting the natural world. The United Nations Environment Programme’s Global Adaptation Network conducted a stakeholder dialogue process to assess the most crucial barriers to ecosystem-based adaptation and how they can be overcome. This report aims to provide an overview of the main findings and conclusions of this process across three different regions: Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. This report is an output of the Global EbA Fund, which is implemented jointly by UNEP and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

A rapid increase in population size and widespread poverty in the area have led to increasing pressure on the lagoon for resources. This unsustainable use of the lagoon system is being compounded and exacerbated by the effects of climate change. To respond to these observed challenges the project will improve the technical and institutional capacity of policy- and decision-makers in Albania to implement adaptation interventions, especially ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA).

        "content": "Urban Ecosystem-based Adaptation for climate-resilient development in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal The Kathmandu Valley in Nepal is urbanizing rapidly due to rural-urban migration. Urban expansion is causing ecosystem degradation and affecting the provision of crucial ecosystem services such as flood attenuation, soil stabilization and groundwater recharge. Further, inadequate urban planning has resulted in the establishment of informal settlements in hazard-prone areas that are characterized by limited basic services. This, together with the impacts of climate change, is putting poor urban communities often living in these informal settlements at risk. To address this problem, UNEP and its partners are working to build climate change resilience of urban communities by implementing urban ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation (EbA). Urban EbA enhances urban ecosystems’ ability to provide key ecosystem services which can help buffer vulnerable urban communities from extreme weather events such as floods, landslides improving these communities’ resilience to climate change. The adaptation interventions of this project include developing technical guides and policy briefs to mainstream urban EbA, improving the knowledge base of EbA through awareness raising programmes and implementing urban EbA interventions on the ground, such as rehabilitating and restoring ecosystems and establishing urban green spaces.

        "content": "Catalysing ecosystem restoration for climate resilient natural capital and rural livelihoods in degraded forests and rangelands of Nepal In Nepal, natural resources in forest and rangeland ecosystems underpin many local industries, but due to unsustainable land use practices, soil erosion is increasing which is reducing soil fertility and affecting water supplies. This, together with the impacts of climate change, poses a threat to local and indigenous communities that depend on ecosystem goods and services for their livelihoods. To address this problem, UNEP and its partners are working to build climate change resilience by implementing ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation (EbA) in degraded forests and rangelands in mid-hill and high mountain areas and to generate awareness of EbA and increase understanding on the role of EbA in climate change adaptation. Traditional knowledge, coupled with scientific research, is used to develop an integrated suite of adaptation interventions to restore forests and rangelands, improve livestock management, reduce soil erosion, increase water harvesting and develop additional livelihood options from forests, rangelands, and agro-ecosystems. These interventions are enhancing the capacity of the ecosystems to adapt to climate change and provide important goods and services to indigenous and local communities. In doing so, these ecosystems are providing a buffer from extreme weather events and temperature increases improving communities’ resilience to climate change. This project will build on several ongoing baseline projects, including the Leasehold Forestry Programme (LFP), the Multi-Stakeholder Forestry Project (MSFP), the Tree Improvement Programme (TIP), the Building Climate Resilience of Watersheds in Mountain Eco-Regions project (BCRWMER) and the Livestock Service Development and Extension Programme (LDSEP).

The project aims to address the vulnerability of urban communities to climate change in three medium-sized cities: San Salvador (El Salvador), Kingston (Jamaica) and Xalapa (Mexico) through the implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation approaches and their integration into urban planning. In San Salvador, a degraded watershed will be restored with reforestation and conservation agriculture approaches. This will reduce runoff and erosion during heavy rainfall and increase ground water recharge. In Kingston, a watershed will be restored using native tree species to mitigate the impacts of floods and droughts. In Xalapa, revegetation and soil conservation will be undertaken along a stream using species adapted to flooding. At the urban landscape scale, permeable walkways will be constructed to promote rainwater infiltration, and an artificial wetland and a riparian park will be established. At the household scale, ecological sanitation plans will be developed, and rainwater harvesting systems constructed at schools and public buildings.

Crucially, wetlands and forests also reduce the negative impacts of climate change on local communities by absorbing excess rainwater into the ground during floods and providing sources of water during droughts. However, the increased demand for food, timber and other ecosystem services has led to the degradation of these ecosystems, which in turn, reduces their ability to protect communities against the impacts of climate change. UNEP is now supporting the Government of Zambia to improve the climate resilience of local people living near wetlands by strengthening the capacity of local communities and local governments to implement interventions. This is being achieved by piloting ecosystem-based adaptation measures in sites across the Bangweulu and Lukanga wetlands (and adjacent forest ecosystems) and by providing training to the local and national governments on adaptation planning and implementation. Knowledge and lessons learned on the benefits and execution of the nature-based solutions will also be disseminated with an aim of promoting the upscaling of such approaches in other areas in the country.

As climate change evolves with increasing temperatures and more erratic rainfall in Sudan, there is a need to find approaches that can reduce the vulnerability of small-holder rain-fed farmers and pastoralists. Exemplifying the looming threat, the Sahara Desert is advancing from North to South at a rate of about one mile per year, eliminating grazing land and water holes. To combat these challenges, the Sudan EbA project is being implemented with the overall aim of increasing the resilience of livelihoods and agricultural systems in the White Nile State through EbA approaches. The project is carrying out rangeland regeneration, afforestation, rainwater harvesting and drought-tolerant agriculture. At least 6,800 households will be provided with access to climate change-resilient food and water sources. The project is building 10 water reservoirs and wells, and at least 3,200 men and women will be given access to solar-powered hand pumps for these wells. Around 200 rainwater harvesting pits will be installed across 2,000 community farms. Communities are also being trained in climate-proof livelihood practices, such as poultry breeding and home-garden farming. Drawing on an analysis of the economic and social benefits from ecosystem-based adaptation approaches, the project will support the Higher Council for Environment and Natural Resources to advocate for the integration of EbA approaches into key sector policies (e.g. agriculture, land and water) and national development plans to enable wider replication of such activities in other regions.

O WASP é liderado pelo Programa das Nações Unidas para o Meio Ambiente (PNUMA), pela Organização Meteorológica Mundial (OMM), pela Convenção-Quadro das Nações Unidas sobre a Mudança do Clima (UNFCCC), pelo Painel Intergovernamental sobre as Mudanças Climáticas (IPCC), pelo Fundo Verde para o Clima (GCF), pelo Fundo Global para o Meio Ambiente (GEF) e pela Universidade das Nações Unidas (UNU). O WASP dispõe de um painel internacional com uma estrutura de administração multissetorial constituída por um grupo de gestão, um comitê científico e um comitê de política e finanças. Saiba mais Visão A visão central do WASP é a de um mundo em que as lacunas de conhecimento sobre a adaptação climática sejam supridas para os formuladores de políticas nos governos, nas empresas e na sociedade civil. Há uma ênfase especial no conhecimento científico relevante para as políticas, com prioridade às necessidades de pesquisa nos países em desenvolvimento vulneráveis. Essa visão engloba três componentes principais:  1. Catalisar suprindo as lacunas de conhecimento atuais O WASP catalisa pesquisas que abordam as necessidades de conhecimento para as ações e a tomada de decisões de adaptação. Nesta categoria, algumas ações incluem: identificar lacunas de conhecimento e supri-las por meio da promoção de pesquisas relacionadass; contribuir para o GT II do IPCC, as ações práticas de ​​adaptação e as políticas por meio do processo da UNFCCC; e responder às necessidades identificadas pelas organizações patrocinadoras do WASP. Este componente da visão seria apoiado por plataformas e parcerias do WASP que podem ajudar a catalisar essas pesquisas. 2. Catalisar suprindo possíveis lacunas futuras de conhecimento O WASP, por meio do envolvimento com a comunidade científica da adaptação em geral, incluindo o GT II do IPCC, identifica as principais incertezas e limitações nas áreas científicas subjacentes relevantes para a adaptação (ciências sociais e naturais) e trabalha para solucioná-las. Isso incluiria o preenchimento de nichos/lacunas não abordados por outros, levando em conta o trabalho inovador, as tendências emergentes e o pensamento vanguardista. Assim como no parágrafo 2.1 acima, este componente da visão seria também apoiado por plataformas e parcerias do WASP que podem ajudar a catalisar essas pesquisas. 3. Disponibilizar orientações relevantes para as políticas por meio de produtos do WASP  Isso inclui produtos da autoria de membros do WASP e outros peritos que podem incorporar orientações baseadas em evidências com o objetivo de suprir as lacunas identificadas relevantes para o planejamento, a implementação e a avaliação da adaptação; por exemplo, o uso de dados científicos do WASP para produzir resumos de políticas de adaptação.

        "content": "Building Resilience in the Coastal Zone through Ecosystem-Based Approaches to Adaptation in the Greater Maputo Area The Republic of Mozambique is located in East Africa, with over 60% of the population living on the coast. It is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in Africa due not only to its physical location, but also the socio-economic issues that amplify the negative effects of climate change and decrease the population’s capacities to cope and adapt. However, the country also hosts many natural resources and ecosystems that offer multiple goods and services to the local populations, including services and benefits for adapting to climate change. This project aims to reduce the vulnerability of urban and peri-urban communities in the Greater Maputo Region (home to 3 million people) to current and future climate risks by addressing the degradation of ecosystems - and their services - and enhancing the capacity of communities to adapt. The project will do so by strengthening the capacity of municipal and district authorities to plan and implement , restore mangrove and riparian ecosystems, promote climate-resilient livelihood, diversify economic activities, and increase the available knowledge and public awareness on the benefits of ecosystem-based adaptation interventions.

This coupled with inadequate urban planning and drainage systems are leading to severe flooding in the major cities of Vientiane, Paksan, Savannakhet and Pakse. This project is building climate resilience of local communities in these cities through the implementation of an integrated approach to flood management to reduce the impacts of urban flooding and to help manage climate change induced floods in a long-term. The project activities include strengthening technical capacity and knowledge management for Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), developing city-level flood management strategies, and implementing urban EbA solutions, including protecting and restoring wetlands and urban streams along the Mekong River. The project is also supporting the production and dissemination of information on local, regional, and international levels to build technical capacity for the implementation of urban EbA interventions. Overall, the project is contributing to a paradigm shift of urban flood management from hard ‘grey’ infrastructure towards innovative use of integrated ‘green’ infrastructure, such as urban EbA solutions.

        "content": "Promoting climate resilience in the rice sector through pilot investments in Alaotra-Mangoro, Madagascar In Madagascar, UNEP and partners are working to build resilience to the impacts of climate change in the rice production sector. The project is comprised of three components: 1) strengthening of technical and scientific capacities; 2) implementation of a rice production cycle that is resilient and adapted; and 3) leveraging policy change in the rice sector. The project is implemented in the Alaotra-Mangoro region, the primary rice production area in Madagascar. Climate change is expected to affect rainfall patterns and decrease overall water availability. This, together with continued environmental degradation, poses a serious risk to rice yields and livelihoods in the region. The project is piloting an integrated rice cultivation model that will achieve sustainable yield increases under a changing climate. Concrete changes to rice production practices (from inputs to harvest management) are being implemented, including measures to restore ecological services. Climate-resilient rice varieties have been selected through participatory field testing, and dynamic agricultural calendars have been developed and distributed to the local population. The dissemination of climate information, forecasts and early warning is also being improved. Water infrastructure for irrigation has been upgraded, reforestation activities have been undertaken, and improved livestock and land management approaches (e.g. crop rotation and inter-cropping) have been introduced. All these activities will lead to sustainable increases in rice yields. To prevent post-harvest losses, the project is also developing storage facilities with phytosanitary control, serving as trading points and markets.

        "content": "Adapting coastal zone management to climate change in Madagascar considering ecosystem and livelihoods The increased frequency and intensity of climate-related hazards (including floods, droughts and tropical storms) is threatening the livelihoods, health and well-being of populations living in the coastal zones of Madagascar. Most local communities in these areas live below the poverty line and rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture and coastal resources to support their livelihoods. The project aims to address the adverse effects of climate change on the coastal communities in four regions of Madagascar. For example, UNEP is helping the government to support communities to rehabilitate mangrove habitats and other shoreline vegetation, which can provide natural flood defenses and protection against sea-level rise and coastal erosion. Hard coastal protection infrastructure (sea-wall and groynes) will also be rehabilitated to complement the natural infrastructure interventions. Efforts are underway to climate-proof and diversify local livelihoods to increase resilience towards unpredictable changes in climate. These activities include the diversification of crops, the introduction of improved agricultural, fishing and crab production techniques, and modified fishing calendars that avoid overfishing by accounting for new climate parameters and the spawning and breeding times of different species. These activities reduce the need for land clearing and mangrove deforestation while generating income and food production.

In Cambodia, UNEP and partners are helping people adapt to climate change by improving agricultural resilience, reforesting vast swathes of natural land, and establishing ‘home-gardens.’ Unabated deforestation and climate change have dried out soils and caused a fall in rainfall for some parts of the country. In response, this project trained people to grow trees in specially constructed nurseries and carry out patrols to halt illegal logging. The project is restoring at least 1,875ha of land, and forests, wildlife and water are already returning. From mountains to the coast, the project is helping rural Cambodians to set up small farms and irrigation systems to improve both diets and incomes. The project has repaired falling yields and failed harvests of staple crops - such as rice - by training farmers on climate forecasting and how to plant paddies with more resilient varieties. The agricultural productivity will be increased for at least 1,900 family agriculture areas.

        "meta_description": "Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) is an annual UNEP flagship publication. The report's primary objective is to inform the negotiators of the UNFCCC Member States, and the broader UNFCCC constituency, about the status and trends within climate adaptation at global and regional levels. The AGR also provides a set of science-based options to policymakers and decision-makers to increase ambition in adapting to climate change across key climate-sensitive sectors. Since 2014, UNEP has produced science-based assessments of the adaptation gap with the purpose of facilitating an adequate adaptation response in the context of the temperature and adaptation goals of the UNFCCC process. The adaptation gap is the difference between actually implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to climate change impacts, and reflecting resource limitations and competing priorities. An expert and stakeholder meeting, convened in mid-January 2020, discussed the future framing of the AGR and agreed on a general structure for future AGRs focuses on bringing together multiple sources of information (e.g. scientific literature, international donor project documents, and countries’ reports to the UNFCCC) to move towards an answer to the fundamental question: are we globally on track for successful adaptation commensurate with emissions’ pathways? As well as tracking progress, efforts to answer this question can help to highlight gaps in progress, for example in specific sectors, sections of society, or geographies that will need prioritization and international support to progress towards climate resilience.  To date, seven global AGRs and one intermediary update report have been produced: The first report AGR 2014 provided a preliminary approach to assessing adaptation gaps and initial assessments of adaptation gaps in three important areas: finance, technology, and knowledge. An intermediary update report prepared for COP 21 in Paris, France, in 2015.  The AGR 2016 provided a more in-depth assessment of the adaptation finance gap and its projected development up to 2050, focusing on global estimates of the costs of adaptation as well as the financing available for adaptation. The AGR 2017, launched in 2017 at COP 23 in Bonn, Germany, focused on a key question arising in the wake of the global goal on adaptation specified in the Paris Agreement: What are the ways forward to assess progress towards this global goal? The AGR 2018, launched during COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, had two parts: Part One examined the gaps that exist in a number of areas central to taking stock and assessing progress on adaptation; Part Two had an in-depth focus on assessing the global adaptation gap in health. The AGR 2020, launched on 14 January 2021, provided the first recurrent assessment of the global status and progress of the adaptation process across three core elements (planning, financing, and implementation). In addition, this year’s report took a thematic deep dive into the status and progress of Nature-Based Solutions in adaptation. The report also provided an initial outlook on overall results in adaptation at the global level taking a forward-looking approach.  The AGR 2021, launched on 4 November 2021, found that while policies and planning for climate change adaptation are developing, finance and implementation are still far behind where they need to be. In addition, the report finds that the opportunity to use the fiscal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize green economic growth that also helps nations adapt to climate impacts such as droughts, storms, and wildfire is largely being missed. The AGR 2022, launched on 3 November 2022, found that country adaptation plans, strategies, laws and policies are getting better at prioritizing disadvantaged groups (such as Indigenous peoples), however financing to turn these plans and strategies into action isn’t following. In addition, the implementation of adaptation actions (concentrated in agriculture, water, ecosystems and cross-cutting sectors) is increasing, although without a step change in support, adaptation actions could be outstripped by accelerating climate risks, further widening the adaptation implementation gap. The AGR 2023, launched on 2 November 2023, finds that progress on climate adaptation is slowing when it should be accelerating to catch up with these rising climate change impacts.  With the need to adapt to accelerating climate change, the importance of the AGR will grow in the coming years as it will provide updates on progress across key adaptation indicators. To maximize the value-added of the AGR in relation to the post-Paris process, the AGR Steering Committee favors a multi-year planning process. This implies that each subsequent AGR builds on the previous year’s content. Adaptation Research Alliance (ARA) As part of the UK COP 26 Presidency Adaptation & Resilience campaign, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO) is working with partners to develop an international Adaptation Research Alliance for launch at COP 26. This global collaborative effort will seek to catalyze increased investment and capacity for action-orientated research that supports effective adaptation to climate change – primarily in developing countries – at the scale and urgency demanded by the science. Following the soft launch at the Gobeshona Global Conference, a development phase of nine months will ensure that partners conduct the groundwork necessary for launching an ambitious, transformative, and credible ARA at COP26. WASP is a key partner in this endeavor. International Platform of Adaptation Metrics (IPAM) The formulation of standardized adaptation metrics is one of the great trans-disciplinary challenges of our time. Building knowledge and consensus on adaptation metrics are critical for climate adaptation policy and business imperatives at all scales, functions, and sectors, to articulate and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and for investment decision-making at scale. We are working with IPAM so as to find a common purpose to address these concerns.",

These impacts, coupled with rapid urbanization and coastal development, water pollution, and deforestation make the Mediterranean region increasingly vulnerable to climate change. Funded by the Global Environment Facility, a project is increasing the climate resilience of the marine and coastal areas in Albania, Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Montenegro, and Tunisia. It aims to achieve this by strengthening the capacities of these countries to implement and to access international climate financing with a view to influencing wider development processes. One of the main objectives is to mainstream climate adaptation measures into Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plans. The project is convening 200+ key stakeholders in 2 priority coastal areas to identify solutions for coastal resilience, while promoting knowledge exchange on adaptation planning. The project is part of the larger USD 43.4 million GEF-funded ) that aims to reduce the major transboundary environmental stresses affecting the Mediterranean Sea and its coastal areas, while strengthening climate resilience and water security, and improving the health and livelihoods of coastal populations.

This project involves building an interactive web-based platform for knowledge-sharing. The project is producing documentaries, funding guidance, policy briefs and planning tools for adaptation activities. On-the-ground ecological restoration will rehabilitate 29 hectares of mangrove forests in the Seychelles, thus providing natural flood barriers. community-based watershed habitat is being restored in Nepal with over 500,000 seedlings planted, and in attempts to control desertification in Mauritania, it is restoring 450 hectares of multi-use desert greenbelt. Through these interventions, UNEP is regulating water quality, flow and storage, thereby improving freshwater provision and food security. These interventions increase the supply of non-timber forest products, such as fruit, nuts and fiber. Biodiversity is boosted by the added protection from extreme weather events, especially when it comes to shoreline defense from coastal storm surges. Furthermore, by protecting marine spawning grounds, UNEP is strengthening the production of fisheries and the associated economic benefits.

        "meta_description": "Adaptation at Altitude : Mountains at the frontline of climate change  Geographical scope: Global and interregional (South Caucasus, East Africa, Hindu Kush Himalaya, Andes, as well as Alps and Carpathians) Time frame: 2020-2023 Partners: Mountain Research Initiative, CONDESAN, ICIMOD, Stockholm Environment Institute, University of Geneva, Zoi Environment Network Co-financiers: Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) Contributions to SDGs: 15.4., 13.2., 13.3. Environmental challenge Given the unprecedented speed and magnitude of climate change in mountains adding to rapidly changing conditions, it is crucial that practical adaptation solutions be developed and implemented. The IPCC WGII cross-chapter on mountains finds that current adaptation efforts are insufficient to address future risks in mountain regions. It is often the coupled effects of poverty, dependence on degrading natural resources and high exposure to natural hazards where climate change puts mountain ecosystems and livelihoods under additional pressure. Effective adaptation must take an inclusive approach that addresses climate-related risks together with other socio-economic developments. This can enable mountain communities to conserve, restore and sustainably manage the key ecosystem goods and services on which their livelihoods depend.     Addressing mountain-specific challenges and exploiting opportunities to adapt to changing future environments require a regional approach due to the cross-border nature of mountain ranges. Cooperation and exchange at regional levels tap into local (traditional) knowledge, address challenges of mutual concern and support the development of adequate and regionally-tailored solutions. Strengthening regional dialogue can also help ensure that adequate mountain adaptation policies are taken on board at national levels. Programme The overall objective of the Adaptation at Altitude programme is to increase knowledge on climate change and appropriate adaptation solutions in mountains. This is then fed into science-policy platforms for informed decision-making in national, regional and global policy processes. As a result, the long-term desired impact is to increase the resilience of both mountain communities and ecosystems to climate change. The programme – which has been initiated and fully funded by the Swiss Agency of Development of Cooperation (SDC) – aims to respond to the above challenges with four goals: To improve the availability and use of mountain observation data and information on climate change impacts in mountains; To integrate mountain climate change adaptation into planning and policy processes; To strengthen and apply knowledge on climate change adaptation solutions in mountains; To ensure that major global policy processes take climate change adaptation in mountains into account. UNEP is deeply involved in the second component, which also promotes interregional dialogue and exchange.

The overall objective is to promote collaboration among partners and across mountain regions on innovative approaches that provide mutual benefits and enhance the effectiveness of actions towards inclusive sustainable mountain development. Activities include the publication of evidence-based innovative approaches in the open access, peer-reviewed journal titled “Mountain Research and Development” (MRD), hosting several webinars, and organizing a first Mountain Innovation Fair as well as an award.

        "meta_description": "New UNEP report shows how buildings and community spaces can be constructed to increase resilience to climate change, especially in developing countries.",
        "content": "The past decade was the hottest in human history. Apocalyptic fires and floods, cyclones and hurricanes are increasingly the new normal, and emissions are 62 per cent higher now than when international climate negotiations began in 1990. The evidence is clear. We are in a race against time to adapt to a rapidly changing climate – one of the three planetary crises we face along with biodiversity loss, pollution and waste. Accounting for , the construction industry will play an important role in achieving our goal to limit global warming to well below 2°C. According to some estimates, investing in more resilient infrastructure could also save humanity a from climate change damages. UNEP’s new report, shows how buildings and community spaces can be constructed to increase resilience, especially in developing countries, where settlements are largely self-built. The report also demonstrates how combining ‘grey’ building solutions with ‘green’ can have promising results. As kicks off, we look at five ways to make buildings resilient to climate change with some examples from the region: Studies show that by 2050, . Coupled with the ‘ which makes cities warmer than the surrounding rural area, this puts urban dwellers at high risk. But nature provides powerful solutions. Communities can create urban forests and green spaces to reduce heatwaves in cities as trees and other plants cool the surrounding environment by offering shade and releasing water through their leaves. Structural designs can also help reduce heat inside buildings. In Vietnam, traditional housing designs such as the optimum orientation of buildings, high-rise rooms, and large openings improve ventilation. Trombe walls - heavyweight structures of concrete, stone, or other heavy material that capture solar heat are used in China, Chile, and Egypt. Green roofs and reflective surfaces can also reduce temperatures in and around buildings. Climate change is affecting rainfall patterns across the world. Rainwater harvesting and recharge systems that capture water on the roofs of buildings are commonly used to store water during drought and reduce flood risk during heavy rains. The collected water can be stored in tanks and used inside the building during periods of drought. Another cost-effective, nature-based way to address droughts and flooding is to plant trees or other vegetation around buildings. The roots of the plants act like sponges to recharge groundwater, and during heavy rainfall, . In China, the Sponge Cities Project is piloting eco-engineering solutions to absorb and reuse rainwater in over 30 metropolises to reduce flooding risks. By 2025, and sea-level rise. In Kerala, India, flood-resistant houses are constructed on pillars to allow floodwater to flow underneath. On Malaysia’s coasts, buildings elevated 2 meters above the ground allow waterflow and wetland vegetation to grow underneath, with houses and public areas connected through elevated passages. One approach proposed in Bangladesh is to build a buoyant multi-purpose building that would rest on pillars with buoyant tanks that raise it during floods. The building would function as a community center and also provide emergency shelter during flooding. Cyclones and storms are . They can affect buildings in many ways, such as blowing off roofs and damaging the structures and foundations of the building. To mitigate this damage, communities can build round-shaped houses and consider optimum aerodynamic orientation to reduce the strength of the winds. Roof design also plays an important role. Strong connections between foundations and the roof are critical to building wind-resilient houses. Roofs with multiple slopes can stand well in strong winds, and installing central shafts reduces wind force and pressure to the roof by sucking in air from outside. Roofs that cover balconies or patios can also be designed to break during strong winds to prevent additional structural damage to the essential parts of the house. This is called frangible architecture or ‘planning for damage’ approach. Adapting to cold and temperate climates requires capturing heat and minimizing heat loss. Insulations in roofs, walls, ceilings, and double-glazed windows help to minimize heat loss and lead to more energy efficient buildings. In colder regions, Trombe walls can absorb heat by day and radiate it out by night when it is colder. Water has a high capacity to store heat and can be used in “water walls” – that instead of concrete, contain drums of water to store heat. Buildings should be also be oriented to maximize sun exposure, and external surfaces of walls should be painted dark. Green roofs that support plant growth on rooftops are used in many cities around the world and have been shown to provide insulation and reduce the energy demand for cooling during summer and heating during winter. © 2024 UNEP"

        "content": "Despite being responsible for only around 3 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, experts say that Africa will be the region hardest hit by climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) , the continent is warming faster than the global average, which is likely to bring devastating impacts, from extreme rainfall to drought to coastal flooding. In the years to come, preparing for the impacts of climate change, known as , will be key for African nations. Adaptation – reducing countries’ and communities’ vulnerability to climate change by increasing their ability to absorb impacts and remain resilient – is a key pillar of the . UNEP’s found that while nations have advanced in planning and implementation adaptation projects, huge gaps remain, especially in finance for developing countries. One approach to adaptation is rapidly gaining traction: . These draw on the systems of the natural world to overcome the challenges wrought by climate change – and their benefits can be huge. For example, protecting forests and mangroves alone could prevent in yearly climate-related losses. This week, leaders are gathering online for , where they will explore challenges and opportunities for . To mark the occasion, we take a look at how eight communities in Africa are using nature-based solutions to adapt to a changing world. Victorin Laboudallon, a grandfather and local celebrity from the Seychelles is planting forests to tackle climate change. The Seychelles, a nation of 115 islands off the east coast of Africa, is vulnerable to rising sea levels but mangrove forests provide natural seawalls that act as a buffer against flooding and storms. “If the mangroves are gone, the nation of Seychelles will be gone,” says Laboudallon. After retiring from a long career in environmental conservation, Laboudallon created his of volunteers to help reforest his country. Laughing, he explains how his surname means “friend of the mud” in his local creole language. In the Vatovavy Fitovinany region of Madagascar, erratic rains and droughts have led to sharply declining rice harvests. With support from the government and the , Vivienne Rakotoarisoa (pictured) and her family adapted by switching to livelihoods that are more drought resilient. For instance, rambo – or grey sedge – is a drought-tolerant aquatic plant, highly popular as a weaving material. Rakotoarisoa has provided a more stable income for her family in a changing climate. Women and children carry branches and twigs down from the forests on top of Anjouan Island, Comoros. Rising temperatures and deforestation are drying out the soil in the area, turning forests into deserts. To counter that, the government is plant 1.4 million trees in watershed habitats. The trees trap moisture in the ground and prevent erosion on farmland by binding the soil, helping to foster food security. A representative from Djibouti’s environment ministry inspects a tree nursery in the rapidly drying north. Djibouti is one of many African countries involved in the Great Green Wall of Africa, an ambitious plan to restore ecosystems along the southern frontier of the Sahara. The initiative is designed to prevent the spread of the desert and the consequent destruction of water supplies and livelihoods. Once completed, the Great Green Wall is expected to be the largest living structure on the planet, and by 2030. In the Eastern Cape, South Africa, the government embarked on a vast ecological experiment to restore huge swaths of degraded land by planting spekboom, an indigenous plant. Spekboom increases water infiltration in the ground, boosting groundwater supplies and reducing flooding. The plant also absorbs carbon dioxide faster than most other trees in dry conditions. Anthony Mills, CEO of AfriCarbon, says that new green jobs have been created through the restoration, which began in 2008. “We are hoping that spekboom thicket restoration can be a flagship pioneering programme for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration,” he said. The , launched in June this year, is a global call to action to restore the world’s ecosystems. Malawi is Africa’s third-largest tea producer but dwindling productivity, a consequence of climate change, has forced smallholder tea farmers to take up logging. This makes tea farming even more difficult. The felling of trees speeds erosion, removes an important buffer from floods and deprives farmers of the pollinating power of insects. The Malawi Tea Landscapes Adaptation Project is to restore forests and train in professions, like beekeeping or crafting, that are less damaging than logging. In the increasingly dry north east of the Gambia, a woman surveys her crops in a community garden. Droughts, erratic rains and rising temperatures combined with deforestation have fed desertification here. Nearly left the Gambia and entered Europe through the Mediterranean Sea between 2009 and 2019, the highest rate of any African country. But now, one of the largest development projects in the history of the Gambia is aiming to restore over 10,000 hectares of land and improve water security. Lamin Dibba, the Gambia’s Minister of Environment, says he hopes the project will not only support farmers, but also generate 25,000 green jobs to help provide local opportunities for the young men who risk their lives on the perilous journey to Europe. The Tanzanian government has been to protect biodiversity and adapt to climate change in the Kiteto District, home to many ethnic groups, including the semi-nomadic Maasai. Here, prolonged droughts and higher temperatures have triggered crop failures and food shortages since the 1990s. In July 2020, indigenous and community leaders from Olengapa received certificates of legal occupancy for their sacred sites and cattle grazing areas, which has helped to solve conflicts over land and natural resources. The same project planted an indigenous grass species, buffelgrass, to increase the climate resilience of local pastures, as the plant is more acclimatized to the increasing aridity of the rangeland.

        "content": "The Seychelles, a nation known for exquisite beaches and turquoise waters, has been described by some as a sinking paradise. “Nowadays you can see the water coming higher. It’s climate change,” says Godfrey Albert, 48, a Seychellois fisherman from Mahe Island. “At this time of year, we’re not supposed to have rain and yet we have rain. Everything has changed.” Beyond erratic rainfall, increasing coastal storms, and rising sea levels are eroding the shorelines and flooding people’s land. For a country where 80 per cent of economic activities occur in coastal regions, this poses a grave threat. Gesturing towards the open sea, Albert shrugs: “I told you, man. It’s a hard life in paradise.” These climate impacts are made even worse by the destruction of coastal mangrove forests that once surrounded many of the country’s 115 islands. Mangroves act as an extremely effective defence against coastal flooding and erosion by reducing the height and strength of waves. The fate of the fishing industry, which along with tourism is the most important source of income in the country, is tied to mangroves. The forests provide a breeding ground for fish before going out to sea, and the organic matter trapped in the roots offer vital nutrients for many fish species. Funded by the , a project worked with communities in the Seychelles – along with Mauritania and Nepal – to use nature to adapt to the impacts of climate change, a strategy termed The project, known as , was executed by the National Development and Reform Commission of China, through the Chinese Academy of Sciences. By planting mangroves across the Seychelles, demonstrated how countries can build the resilience of local communities against storms and floods while improving local fish stocks. The restored mangrove forests not only protect the land from the sea but also protect the sea from land by filtering out litter and sediment as it’s washed down from the mountains and into oceans. Without mangroves, the sediment covers the coral, killing fish and the local fishing businesses. “Mangroves play a big role in the sea. They filter everything,” says Missia Dubignon, a volunteer of the , a partner of . “Plant a tree, save a life,” says Dubignon with a smile. worked in three completely different ecosystems to promote knowledge-sharing: the coasts of Seychelles, the mountains of Nepal and the deserts of Mauritania. In Mauritania – one of the most arid countries in the world - the climate is becoming hotter and drier, devastating water supplies and crop yields. Here, used nature as a defence by planting ‘shelter belts’, a line of trees or shrubs that protects an area from extreme weather. The newly planted trees are shielding crops from wind erosion and desertification by holding together the soil and retaining moisture in the ground. Tree nurseries were constructed to supply the required trees, and trainings were given to local communities to understand which species are best for warding off desertification. In Nepal, increased monsoon rainfall and decreased winter rainfall is leading to crop losses from both droughts and floods. The sponge-like properties of many tree root systems can tackle these impacts by recharging groundwater supplies during intense rain, and absorbing water into the ground during flooding. Community-based restoration was carried out by to protect crop yields, with over 840,000 seedlings planted. is seen as a flagship initiative for South-South cooperation – enabling an exchange between countries in the Global South in the form of technology transfer, capacity-building, policy support or fundraising. During the project, China, Mauritania, Seychelles and Nepal regularly exchanged knowledge and best practices on ecosystem-based adaptation, including exchange visits to Mauritania and China. A was built to facilitate collaboration – it contains webinars, case studies, an ecosystem-based adaptation planning tool and other knowledge products. Research programmes were established in partnership with local universities to advance ecosystem-based adaptation science and measure the effects of the project’s restoration activities. Thirteen scientific papers were produced by the Nepal team, seven by Seychelles and 11 by Mauritania. This exchange of knowledge culminated in an array of publications and tools now used by practitioners across the Global South, such as the ecosystem-based adaptation planning tool A published in the journal captures some of the key outcomes of the project. Other publications that emerged from the project’s work in South-South cooperation, include a a resource guide for and a reference guide to Speaking at a 2019 conference, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said, “South-South cooperation will be vital to ensure mutual support and exchange of best practices to enhance adaptation.” From research programmes to on-the-ground restoration, demonstrates how to turn those words into action. © 2024 UNEP"

After a month of hearing the many stories of countrymen being extorted and killed in Libya, drowning in the Mediterranean or becoming beggars on the streets of Europe, a weakened Camora and 140 other Gambians flew home, vowing to start a farming business on home soil. “We go to Senegal to get vegetables—why don’t we try in this country? We can encourage people to grow and stay here,” said Camora, who set up the Association of Returnees from the Back Way. The Gambia is one of the world’s smallest nations, with a population of under 2 million, yet so many Gambians have left that the as one of the world’s top six nations for migration via Libya and the Mediterranean. As a sliver of land with a river running through it to the west African coast, The Gambia is highly susceptible to climate change, and its people very vulnerable after decades of dictatorial rule by President Yaya Jammeh, who was ousted in 2016. Increasingly frequent and severe floods and droughts have caused erosion and damaged agricultural lands, while rising temperatures, erratic rainfall and increasing deforestation and poor farming practices have dried up or washed away soils, leading to degradation and desertification. “In many of these rural areas, the environment and natural resource conditions are one of the driving reasons for migration,” said Alagie Manjang, Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Natural Resources. The rural exodus of largely young people means that 53.5 per cent of Gambians now live around the capital Banjul, where a lack of opportunities drives many young people to set their sights further afield, said Lamin Dibba, The Gambia’s Minister of Environment, Climate Change and Natural Resources. “Most of them think that Europe is the solution, so they leave to look for greener pastures abroad,” he said. Bubu Jallow, a meteorologist and one of The Gambia’s leading climate change negotiators, said that a 30 per cent reduction in rainfall over the past 50 years has caused people to abandon their fields. “This influx from the rural to the urban has been happening since the 1970s, because the rains in this country really failed after 1968,” he said. Fatou Jammeh Touray is Governor of The Gambia’s Upper River Region, where there has been a massive exodus of youth, and many losses. “So many young people have died,” he said, recalling meeting one family that lost seven sons to boats sinking in the Mediterranean in 2016. Touray and other politicians are keen to dispel the myths spread through social media that Europe, a short hop across the “river”, is a poor man’s paradise. Camora’s Association of Returnees from the Back Way is looking to stop young people from leaving The Gambia and helping those who return to go back to farming by getting land in the most hard-hit provinces. The Association has already managed to secure some areas of degraded land by approaching village chiefs, and hopes that young people will be given more opportunities as the government tries to build a green economy. Dibba wants to create 25,000 green jobs for young people in their communities to stem migration and stop The Gambia from becoming even more dependent on importing food, as villages empty of young people “and they are left with only old people who don’t have the strength to till the soil”. He has high hopes of turning the tide against migration, rural poverty and the country’s food insecurity with a US$25.5 million large-scale Ecosystems-based Adaptation project. “This project is the single largest natural resource development project ever launched in the history of the development of this country,” he announced at the launch of the project in January 2018 in Banjul. The Ecosystems-based Adaptation project will in four regions by rehabilitating degraded farmland, savannahs and forests with native species, and developing a sustainable, natural resource-based economy managed by local communities. “The project will rehabilitate up to 10,000 hectares of degraded forest and wildlife parks through reforestation, enrichment planting, conservation of rare or endangered species as well as the restoration of 3,000 hectares of abandoned and marginal agricultural lands,” said Dibba. UN Environment will implement the project, largely funded by the , over the next six years with the aim of helping at least 11,500 households directly and 46,500 indirectly, of which half will be women, across four target regions. “We all left this country to look for greener pastures and we’ve returned back to look for it here,” said Camora. “We have to believe in ourselves and say that we are Africans, not Europeans, and people there might be further ahead than us here in The Gambia, but as youths we need to encourage Gambians so that they can stay and do well here.” © 2024 UNEP"

        "content": "“When I was younger, everything was normal, even the rain,” Vivienne Rakotoarisoa reminisces. “But nowadays everything is irregular. When we start planting, the rain doesn’t come anymore.” In days past, family life in Madagascar’s Vatovavy Fitovinany region followed the seasons. Rice seeds were always sown in October to coincide with the onset of the rainy season. But today, the seasons are unpredictable. “There have been times when it doesn’t rain for seven months. Farming is difficult and it’s generally harder to earn money.” Droughts and erratic precipitation are just some of the climate-related challenges Vivienne and her community face today. Madagascar also ranks third on the World Bank’s list of countries most vulnerable to increased frequency and intensity of storms as a result of global warming—with the island’s large coastal population particularly at risk. Over the last 20 years, extreme weather events such as flooding, cyclones and high temperatures have taken a heavy toll on the nation’s rural communities, severely affecting agriculture, livelihoods and access to basic necessities. “From 1997, the flooding got heavy—worse than before,” explains 50-year-old Vivienne who lives with her husband, brother and son in Mangatsiotra village on Madagascar’s south-eastern coast. “Access to the town is hard... children can’t go to school and we can’t go to the hospital.” On top of these challenges, flooding also causes saline intrusion into water sources, affecting both drinking water and agricultural productivity—a serious challenge in a country affected by seasonal food insecurity, particularly during the ‘hunger season’, the period between one harvest and the next. Alternating periods of drought and flooding have made the typical staple crop, rice, an unreliable food and livelihood source: “In a bad year, the rice is only enough to eat for one month,” Vivienne says. Today though, Vivienne has found a more reliable crop to cultivate. As the conversation turns to her handmade hat, she wears a proud smile. The woven hat, made from a reed known locally as ‘rambo’, represents a turning point in the fortunes of her family: she crafted it herself from her own rambo plantation. Rambo—or Grey Sedge ( ) —is a drought-resistant aquatic plant. Although it isn’t edible, it is more resilient than rice and its popularity as a handicraft material in Madagascar makes it a valuable crop. With poor rice harvests in recent years having jeopardized local food stocks and income, rambo is fast becoming a popular alternative crop that can be grown year-round. Weaving is not a new skill for Vivienne but cultivating the raw material is. Learning how to grow rambo has allowed her to expand her handicraft output and turn it into a viable livelihood. “I used to buy one bundle of rambo for 6,000 Ariary (US$1.72). Now we harvest about 8 – 15 bundles a month ourselves. From this, I can make and sell about ten big mats, ten small mats and six hats,” she says with satisfaction. Colourful, intricately woven baskets, mats and hats are a common sight in marketplaces and homes around Madagascar. Weavers would traditionally forage for rambo in the wild, but growing demand has opened the way for Vivienne and others to farm and sell the reed. Vivienne is one of 300 community members who were provided with rambo seeds and training in how to cultivate, care for and maximize yield from the crop under the project. Under the -backed initiative, UN Environment and the Government of Madagascar are working to build the long-term resilience of coastal communities, focusing on ecosystem-based adaptation interventions, such as restoration of coastal ecosystems and enhancement of climate-resilient livelihoods. By encouraging and facilitating the adoption of ‘smart’ agricultural practices among local communities, the project has helped vulnerable communities to adopt improved cultivation techniques and reduce reliance on climate-fallible income sources, including through taking up businesses from handicrafts to vanilla, coffee and honey production. Xavier Rabenandrasana is one of more than 250 people who joined beekeeping training courses held by the project team across the Menabe and Vatovavy Fitovinany regions. Xavier says an erratic climate has halved his rice crop in the recent years but learning to diagnose and treat problems in his bee colonies has made apiculture a reliable alternative form of income for him, helping to increase his honey production from each hive to as much as 50 kg a year. “Now, I produce 250 kg every three months,” he says. “With the extra income I can save, pay my debts, prepare the fields, and help support my family.” Additional project activities include the restoration of mangrove swamps to prevent flooding, the stabilization of shorelines through revegetation, and plans for the construction of a one-kilometre-long seawall to halt the problem of coastal erosion. At an institutional level, steps have been taken to increase awareness of the impact of climate change and integrate this into government planning. A series of training sessions were delivered to assist with mainstreaming adaptation strategies into regional development frameworks and policies, the aim being long-term mechanisms for sustainable integrated coastal management. Back in Mangatsiotra village, Vivienne is demonstrating her weaving skills. She explains how weaving rambo was previously only a source of pleasure and relaxation, but participation in the project has given her a different perspective. “It became a source for earning money,” she says. Now, not only has her income from her rambo business increased to around 200,000 Ariary (US$50) per month, but she has renewed hopes for the future. “I plan to expand by one more hectare and only cultivate rambo, instead of rice,” she says smiling. “I dream of having my own shop to sell my rambo products!” Today, Vivienne’s dream might not be far off. As the project moves into its second and final stage, there will be a firm focus on linking community cooperatives to national and international handicraft buyers in the market, bringing the philosophy of bending without breaking from the coastal villages of Madagascar to a store near you. © 2024 UNEP"

This project is helping these people harvest and retain water by rehabilitating 3,500 hectares of watershed habitat. The project aims to plant 1.4 million trees over the course of four years across the country’s three islands. For farmers living within increasingly parched and degraded watersheds, this ecological restoration will prevent their soils from drying-up and being washed downhill. Training will be provided to local communities to manage and protect their land and watersheds, as well as Government staff on improved ecosystem-based land-use planning, climate-resilient agriculture and water resource management. Households in the project sites are expected to gain a 20% increase in average annual income by the end of the 4 year project. The Comoros is a vital hotspot of endemism and biodiversity, and as such, these project interventions will contribute to the conservation of globally significant species.

As a result, communities dependent on agriculture are increasingly turning to natural resources to compensate for the reduced agricultural productivity. The objective of the project is to build the resilience of local communities towards climate impacts in the central and northern region using an ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approach. This will involve integrating climate-resilient agriculture techniques with the tailored restoration of degraded ecosystems. The project will address current and future climate change impacts through components focusing on restoration, particularly riverine forests, that increase the supply of ecosystem goods and services (including water supply, soil conservation, cooling of soils, fiber, medicines, fruits, fuelwood, and timber) The project aims to enhance agricultural productivity through the management of soils and planting of climate-resilient crops, while improving the technical and institutional capacity of governments and communities.

        "content": "When Albert Pati moved closer to the sea to open a beach bar overlooking the Mediterranean in Albania, he never imagined that the sea would also be moving closer to him, now eroding the soil around his restaurant floor. Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, families and businesses around the Adriatic Sea were faced with a serious threat. One of the countries hardest-hit by coastal erosion in Europe, almost a third of Albania’s 427km coastline is being eroded by violent waves. And the challenge is accelerating at an alarming speed due to climate-induced storm surges and rising sea levels. “One time I was driving my children to school when the sea came in front of me and flooded the car,” explains Pati. “If the coast is not protected, then God save us.” In Lezha District, where Pati’s business operates, nuclear bunkers built in the 70s during Albania’s communist era are now lost under the sea, the barely perceptible roofs only just emerging above water. “The damages have been extraordinary,” laments Pati. “Our fishing deck was completely wiped out in a storm. But who to complain to about these things?” COVID-19 came as a second blow. Prior to the outbreak, tourism contributed , employing more than . But with travel having ground to a halt for nearly two months, tourism in Lezha district has been severely impacted. To adapt to the changing climate in Lezha District, the government of Albania is turning to a solution as old as the sea itself: Nature. Covering around 4,000 hectares, the Kune-Vain Lagoon system is a biodiversity wonder, home to around 200 bird species, and an ecological corridor for birds on their migration routes. BirdLife International designated the region an ‘Important Bird Area’ of global significance. The lagoon doesn’t only serve wildlife, but also people, by acting as a natural barrier against coastal erosion, protecting towns and villages– like Pati’s – from flooding. Walking along a narrow aisle of sand dune – the sea on one side and the lagoon on the other – Pati explains: “Where we stand now is a protection for the villages and for the town, because if water covers this ground, the sea will get to the inner part of the lagoon and flow into the town.” If this roughly 30-metre-wide corridor of sand succumbs to erosion, the lagoon will vanish and there will be nothing to stop the sea destroying the coast. With support from the (GEF) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the government of Albania is now reforesting and replanting 2,000 metres along this strip of sand dune. By restoring the vegetation, the project seeks to bind together the soil, strengthening the lagoon’s ability to withstand erosion. The restoration activities are selecting indigenous tree species that are both flood and salt tolerant to ensure long-term survival. This approach of using natural solutions to withstand the impacts of climate change is known as – in essence, look after nature and it will look after you. “Ecosystem-based adaptation protects people from climate change, but also gives space for nature to breathe,” says Atifa Kassam, UNEP’s Programme Officer for the restoration project. “Citizens from all over Albania come to see the Kune-Vain Lagoon. By harnessing the lagoon to help people be resilient to climate change, we can preserve the vital ecotourism industry that keeps nearby towns afloat.” With over 90 percent of lockdown measures imposed by the Albanian government to prevent the spread of coronavirus now eased, taking measures like this to protect local tourism as it recovers is critical. Ecosystem-based adaptation approaches to flooding are also often cheaper than concrete options like seawalls. A study of 52 different sites found that coastal habitats were two to five times more cost-effective at lowering wave heights than engineered structures. The GEF-backed project is training local communities and Albanian government staff on ecosystem-based adaptation, improving the capacity of policymakers to address climate change by using nature. It is also engaging students through hands-on learning, and facilitating studies of PhD and Masters students as they analyse the impacts of the ecosystem-based adaptation at Kune-Vain Lagoon. The approach is also taking root locally. At his beach bar, Pati points to the trees he’s planted on his private land to protect it from storms. “I’ve chosen this tree because it’s very strong and resistant,” he says, pointing to a tree that botanists call . “It grows easily and isn’t harmed by insects.” © 2024 UNEP"

        "meta_description": "This month, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released a brand-new animation to explain the increasingly popular concept of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA).",
        "content": "Restoring and protecting nature is one of the greatest strategies for tackling climate change, but not just for the obvious reason that it sucks carbon out the air. Forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems act as buffers against extreme weather, protecting houses, crops, water supplies and vital infrastructure. The strategy of using nature as a defence against climate impacts is called called – in essence, look after nature and it will look after you. Here are six ways that nature can defend us from climate change impacts: To secure water supplies, societies have traditionally used ‘grey infrastructure’ such as pipelines, dams, and man-made reservoirs. However, ‘green infrastructure’ uses natural or semi-natural systems to provide similar benefits with positive long-term environmental consequences. For example, natural wetlands like streams and lakes act as sponges, drawing water down through the ground and recharging groundwater supplies. When healthy, these ecosystems capture water during intense rainfall and store it for times of drought. Similarly, healthy forests recharge groundwater supplies by absorbing water through their roots, and in doing so, filter drinking water for millions of people worldwide, including more than . The State of Rajasthan, India, endured a devastating drought in 1986. In the following years local communities began to in the region, leading to a rise in groundwater levels by several metres. . First the Amazon, then California, then Australia – wildfires were catastrophic in 2019. Our preventative efforts to reduce the spread of wildfires often involve the removal of forests to create a firebreak (or ‘fuel break’), a strip of land devoid of flora. But there’s a new strategy for firebreaks that involves nature, not less. was made after a severe forest fire in Spain in 2012, where the Mediterranean Cypress trees were able to resist the blaze. The cypresses retain high levels of water in their leaves, even in sweltering heat, and the fallen leaves form a wet environment at the base of the trunk. Plans are now underway to plant the trees as ‘natural firebreaks’ throughout the Mediterranean region. Cities are significantly warmer than the surrounding countryside. This ‘urban heat island effect’ has many causes, including the propensity of concrete and asphalt to absorb heat. In an absurd irony, our air-conditioning systems produce astonishing amounts of carbon emissions, which heat the atmosphere. Our houses stay cool, but the planet doesn’t. Urban tree cover is a win-win solution for our cities. Trees cool the surrounding air by releasing water through their leaves, similar to how humans keep cool by perspiring. Imagine the cooling power of ten air-conditioning units - that’s how much a on a sunny day from evaporation . And that doesn’t include the shade that trees provide, which , can reduce the air-conditioning costs of detached houses by 20-30 per cent. Major cities are now turning to nature to cool down. Melbourne, Australia, is on track to plant more than 3,000 trees each year to tackle heatwaves, almost doubling its urban tree cover by 2040. By 2050 sea-levels could be so high that 300 million people in coastal communities will . There are some coastal ecosystems that can act as cost-effective seawalls combatting the two primary threats of rising seas: coastal flooding and shoreline disintegration. Mangroves and coral reefs, for instance, cause waves to break before they hit the shore, lowering both the force and height of the swell, and in the process reducing the likelihood of the sea breaching over into people’s land. A study across 52 sites found that natural habitats were than engineered structures when it came to lowering wave heights. In the town of Kisakasaka in eastern Tanzania, seawater had been creeping into people’s farms and killed the crops. That is, until the villagers fought back and . Within two years the salt-poisoning of their crops ended and the wells returned to normal. The erratic weather patterns associated with climate change are already exacerbating landslides in many parts of the world. On the Canadian outpost of Banks Island in the last few decades, largely due to thawing permafrost caused by a succession of hot summers. All landslides are caused by loose soil. There are two ways to prevent them: increase the ‘binding capacity’ of the soil, and reduce soil erosion from surface water runoff. Vegetation does both by absorbing water and anchoring the soil in place. In light of this, the government of Comoros is to protect people’s farms in mountainous areas. Desertification is an ongoing threat in places where the climate is drying, and where there is overgrazing and biodiversity loss. When we cut down forests, the desert further expands due to the way in which trees retain moisture in the ground. Since 1920, the Sahara Desert has , decimating waterholes and arable land. This was the motivation behind the Great Green Wall in Africa. To halt the spread of the Sahara and its consequent sandstorms, 21 African countries are working together to grow a ‘8,000 km natural wonder’ of trees and shrubs across the width of Africa. The initiative has the potential to by 2030, according to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. In Sudan, desertification has given rise to violence in some areas, as groups struggle over dwindling resources. In 2017, the government to the drying climate by planting ‘shelter belts’, lines of trees or shrubs that protect an area – especially crops – from extreme weather. The project is building climate resilience in the hopes it will instil peace, making shelter belts not only a nature-based solution for climate change, but also a nature-based solution for conflict. © 2024 UNEP"

Wherever there’s a forest fire in the Seychelles, you can be sure you’ll find Laboudallon ready to fight back, armed with seeds and shovels. “Protecting nature makes me very happy in life,” says Laboudallon. “We need to protect it as much as we can, so other generations can enjoy it like I did when I was a kid.” Laboudallon, 65, has built a network of volunteers, from children to retirees, whom he calls upon to help him with replanting. “If tomorrow we have another fire, we are ready to go back and plant.” Laboudallon is widely known across the Seychelles for his decades of environmental action and his big personality. While planting trees in the wet dirt, barefoot and laughing, he says his surname means “friend of the mud” in his local Creole language. “I’m not somebody who lives under the big concrete. I live under the beautiful trees,” he says, pointing above at the iconic palm. The Seychelles is a nation of 115 islands—known for glistening beaches and stunning biodiversity—off the east coast of Africa. Here climate change is not a distant prospect, but a daily reality. Sea levels are rising and many of the islands are low-lying. As the waters creep higher, the shoreline crumbles away and floods devastate people’s land. “We’ve got the sea rising,” says Laboudallon. “You can see places where there used to be houses. Now there are none. There is something on this planet going wrong.” It’s unknown how the Seychelles will adapt. More than 16 per cent of the nation’s land is , yet a study in the journal suggests Antarctic ice alone could increase sea levels . The waters of this tourist paradise are crystal-clear, but the future is anything but. Nature enthusiasts like Laboudallon have taken matters into their own hands. While giving a tour of his tree nursery, he explains how different types of trees offer different services when adapting to climate change. For the Seychellois, mangroves are fundamental. “If the mangroves are gone, the nation of Seychelles will be gone,” says Laboudallon. “Our protection for human life is the mangroves.” Mangroves defend against the impacts of rising seas and coastal erosion by drastically reducing the height and force of the waves before they hit the shoreline. In fact, if all of today’s mangroves were lost, the global damage from flooding would be an This strategy of using nature—and the services it provides—to adapt to climate change is known as . It’s often cheaper than concrete infrastructure. Not to mention that it simultaneously creates a space for nature. For conservationists like Laboudallon, this is a win-win. Communities can adapt to climate change while protecting biodiversity. It is no longer a choice between people or nature. Considering the Seychelles’ economy is inextricably dependent on ecotourism, ecosystem-based adaptation is seen as a promising approach. “Year after year, we are seeing more evidence of how nature can protect us from climate disasters,” says Jessica Troni, Head of the Climate Change Adaptation Unit at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). “In a major report, the Global Commission on Adaptation states that restoring mangroves for flood defences is 2–5 times cheaper than engineered structures.” Back at a mangrove reforestation site, Laboudallon enthusiastically explains there’s even more to these trees than meets the eye. Mangroves not only protect the land from the sea, but also protect the sea from the land. After the fire season comes the monsoon, which washes all the ash and debris from the forests into the ocean. The layers of dirt fall on the reef like a deadly blanket. “It sits on the surface of the coral and kills it. Then the fish are gone,” says Laboudallon. “Mangroves are used like a strainer. They stop all the debris coming from the hill, making sure only clean water goes out to sea.” “Mangroves also provide a breeding ground for fish,” he says. “If the population of mangroves is still in good health, then fishermen are in good health.” This power of mangroves to protect both the land and coral, whilst generating income for local fishermen, is precisely why UNEP refers to these trees as a ‘super solution’ to climate change. Under a global adaptation project called , or EbA South, the government of Seychelles has been working with leaders like Victorin Laboudallon. Funded by the , the project is using nature to defend against climate impacts in three ecosystems—coastal habitats in Seychelles, dry deserts in Mauritania and mountainous forests in Nepal. Projects like these are vital for the transfer of lessons on ecosystem-based adaptation. For instance, in the Seychelles crabs were eating the mangrove seedlings planted by the project. Using plastic tubing to protect the trees resulted in litter sprawled across the landscape when floods washed them away. Applying the approach of nature-based solutions, local tree planters began using biodegradable tubing made from sugarcane. Through the project these lessons were transferred to other regions of the world. EbA South was executed by the National Development and Reform Commission of China, through the Chinese Academy of Sciences. By increasing collaboration between countries in the global south and sharing solutions for adaptation, the project is seeking to create the next generation of Victorin Laboudallons. The official International Day for South-South Cooperation 12 September. Back on Praslin Island, Laboudallon is getting ready to go home after a long day of tree planting. His efforts have been widely recognized in his home country, having received national awards and honours. With a smile he tells me there’s even a local species of fern named after him— It turns out they’re both quite rare. © 2024 UNEP"

Find out more: In our first episode of the new season, Lis and Marcus delve into how our buildings and homes can adapt to the increasing threats of climate change. Award-winning architect Mariam Issoufou shares her journey of returning to Niger, where she’s using her expertise to tackle extreme heat. Plus, former Climate Change Ambassador Diann Black-Layne from Antigua and Barbuda reveals how a community-based loan scheme is helping locals ‘hurricane-proof’ their homes. Tune in to hear powerful stories of resilience and ingenuity in the face of climate challenges. Lis and Marcus consider one of the most critical issues in adaptation: how to build more climate-resilient food supplies. Eduardo Mansur, the FAO’s Director of the Office of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment, talks about drought-resilient food production, biotechnology, and insect farming. And Louise Mabulo talks about how she founded the Cacao Project in the Philippines to help farmers carve out sustainable, shockproof livelihoods. Lis and Marcus discuss what their ideal climate-resilient cities would look and feel like - and Kobie Brand, the Africa regional director of the global cities network ICLEI, is back to talk about the exciting innovations happening in African cities, including the use of the Minecraft video game to map out climate adaptation strategies in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. And coffee farmer Hector Velasquez explains his crucial role in supporting San Salvador’s ambitions to become a ‘sponge’ city. Lis and Marcus are joined by Koko Warner from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to discuss the parallels between tackling the Covid pandemic and building resilience to climate change. But also, what can we expect at the upcoming COP26 climate summit in Glasgow? Kobie Brand, the Africa regional director of the global cities network ICLEI, shares her lessons on the speed and power of collective action from living through ‘Day Zero’ - the time when Cape Town nearly ran out of water. Lis and Marcus find out about some really creative and practical solutions to the climate threats faced by coastal communities and people living on low-lying small islands. Eritai Kateibwi, from the Te Maeu Project, talks about introducing hydroponics to Kiribati so his community can grow food without monthly ‘king’ tides washing away their crops. And world-renowned Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, who specialises in climate-resilient architecture, talks about floating cities and building flood barriers that double as parks, skateboard ramps, and bike storage - drawing on a concept known as ‘hedonistic sustainability.’ Lis and Marcus explore how investing in adaptation makes both economic sense and helps save the lives of millions of people faced with climate catastrophe. Professor Patrick Verkooijen joins from the Rotterdam-based Global Center on Adaptation which, as the largest floating office in the world, is a potent example of adaptation. And Rohey Ceesay, a forestry officer in the Gambia, talks about how she uses drama and music to spread crucial messages and early warnings about deadly storms.

These will serve as inputs in climate change adaptation planning.  Report on specific actions taken and the progress made since the last APAN Forum on addressing the identified priority knowledge, policy and funding gaps.  Act as a platform for discussions to accelerate action and facilitate the “how” part of adaptation knowledge and programmes with actionable and scalable “next steps” guidelines for communities, stakeholders and governments.  Formulate a set of recommendations on how to expand current efforts on adaptation in the Asia-Pacific region and provide the basis for the region’s contributions to relevant COPs and other global and regional adaptation initiatives.  Previous APAN Fora: 8th APAN Forum 2023 7th APAN Forum 2020 6th APAN Forum 2018 5th APAN Forum 2016 4th APAN Forum 2014 3rd APAN Forum 2013 2nd APAN Forum 2012 1st APAN Forum 2010",

The GEO assessments, and their consultative and collaborative processes, have worked to bridge the gap between science and policy by turning the best available scientific knowledge into information relevant for decision makers (UNEP 2016). The purpose of the course is to advance the understanding and experience of students from around the world who are learning about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), sustainability, and the environment, as well as the importance of the use of science to ensure that deliberative processes and decisions are informed by evidence. Using the Global Environmental Outlook (GEO) to demonstrate how science can inform decision-making, as well as to deepen the abilities of students to use environmental assessments. Based on a pilot initiative by Peking University, the course will provide students and GEO fellows with a structured learning opportunity that exposes them to multilateralism and the use of science to produce actionable knowledge, with the GEO as the focus. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in partnership with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and in collaboration with the Global Council for Science and the Environment (GCSE) have developed The course is about motivating and empowering early career scientists. It aims to inspire them to better inform policy decisions on the environment made on the global and national stages. The curriculum is designed for graduate students and early career professionals globally, who—as a minimum—have an undergraduate degree in the physical or social sciences. The curriculum is divided into 11 modules, which could be taught in a traditional semester system or via an alternative format (e.g., an intensive two-week seminar course). 1. Introduction 2. Role of Science and Scientists in Environmental Decision Making: Ideals & Realities 3. What stops us from Translating Science into Policy? 4. Ensuring Credible Science informs policy 5. Thinking like a policymaker 6. Motivating policy change 7. Case study on plastic waste pollution of the Oceans (Midterm Exam) 8. Getting the word to policymakers PART 1: The art & science of accurate simplicity 9. Getting the word to policy makes Part 2: Using narrative story 10. Enabling policymakers to see the whole picture 11. Examination & Evaluation In general, the modules are composed of four elements: 1) an overview of knowledge and skills to be gained 2) core lecture (to be given by course instructor(s) for consistency) 3) an interactive part (e.g. guest speaker inclusive, interaction with students, panel discussion, mock negotiations or other form of target-oriented group work), and 4) an exercise (homework). Each course module builds on previous modules. The last modules of the course are designed for knowledge synthesis, skill application, and evaluation (of students and the seminar). The exact form of the assessment and the examination might vary depending on the framework conditions and regulations of the university conducting it and can, therefore, have different formats. With expert input from the Global Science to Policy Advisory Committee, Peking University will pilot the course, which will then be offered by institutions within the GEO network and GEO collaborating centres. The will be the first recipients of this course, which will then be developed further for wider distribution.

Growing evidence demonstrates the links between the environment and health. Water and sanitation-related diseases are one of the leading causes of under-five mortality. Damage to women's health from indoor air pollution or from carrying heavy loads of water and fuelwood can make women less fit for childbirth and at greater risk of complications during pregnancy. Malaria, an annual killer of an estimated 1 million children under age five, may be exacerbated as a result of deforestation, loss of biodiversity and poor water management. Up to a quarter of the burden of disease worldwide is linked to environmental factors—primarily polluted air and water, lack of sanitation and vector-borne diseases—and . This section contains methodology for studying the links between health and the environment, otherwise known as \"GEO Health.\" It is aimed at users who wish to study health-environment links in more detail during an environmental assessment or who want to conduct a dedicated \"integrated health and environmental assessment.\" GEO Health in the City of São Paulo is a methodological approach based on understanding the complex interrelation of environmental variables, hazards to health, and loss in quality of life. The complex interrelation between the quality of the environment and human health is the central theme of this report.

This Methodology aims to help stakeholders analyze the interactions between urban development and the environment. It applies the pressures-state-impacts-responses (PSIR) matrix to prepare the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) series. Municipalities can use this tool to prepare an integrated environmental assessment of their city and to support informed policy-making on issues affecting the urban environment. The module on Climate Change Vulnerability and Impact Assessment (VIA) in cities outlines critical approaches to help assess vulnerability to climate change in the context of other non-climatic issues and stresses, such as environmental change and consumption levels, and their integration with other drivers and pressures. In this way, they use the general DPSIR (drivers, pressures, state, impact, and response model of intervention) framework. The DPSIR framework also helps mainstream responses to climate change with other development measures. Planning and management for sustainable development require an understanding of the linkages between environmental conditions and human activities and encourage participation by all sectors of society in decision-making. The GEO cities manual is a useful tool that will help strengthen institutional capacity to prepare environmental assessments and comprehensive reports on cities in Central and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia.

According to Illinois State Climatologist , a series of storms tracked through the region in early spring, including the remnants of in mid-June. Statewide, the average precipitation in June was 9.43 inches during that month, 5.33 inches above average and the wettest June on record. Rainfall in the town of Morton was even higher than the statewide average, accumulating 11.1 inches in June (7.2 inches above average). May and July rainfall were also higher than average, with 5.9 inches in May (0.9 inches above average) and 6.2 inches in July (2.3 inches above average).

Usually, the pumpkins are harvested before heavy frosts begin at the end of October or early November. This year’s harvest ended on October 5 due to poor yields, according to a Libby’s spokesperson in a recent . The University of Illinois Extension program pumpkins as very “tender” vegetables that are highly susceptible to cold temperatures and frost, which can cause them to soften and rot before harvest time. Pumpkins can actually tolerate short periods of hot, dry weather quite well. In fact, when drought hit America’s Heartland in 2012, the pumpkin crop , while corn and soybean yields suffered. “I remember raising pumpkins for fun when I was growing up,” Angel recalls. “They loved dry weather and hated, absolutely hated, wet weather—too wet and they suffered from rot and disease.” Angel notes that similar events have occurred in the recent past, although “sometimes the trouble is in the spring, like this year, and sometimes the trouble is in the fall.” In 2009, he recalls, the pumpkin growing season started out with a wet spring, followed by a record cool July, and a very cold and wet fall that greatly hindered the harvest of pumpkins and other crops. Overall, precipitation has increased by about 2 inches in the early spring in central Illinois ( ). This is consistent with an increasing trend in annual precipitation in the during the past century (by up to 20 percent in some locations), with much of the increase driven by intensification of the heaviest rainfalls. According to the Third National Climate Assessment, this tendency towards more intense precipitation events is projected to continue in the future.

        "content": "For Women’s History Month, Climate.gov has decided to take a brief look at some of the early women in earth and climate science. Women’s History Month serves to honor the first women who had the courage to break into traditionally male spaces and to acknowledge those who went unrecognized for their contributions. It’s likely all of these women faced significant gender discrimination but persevered in the name of discovery. In many cases, their achievements are still not given the recognition they deserve. Below is an incomplete timeline of women in earth and climate science history over the past two centuries. Etheldred Benett is Independently wealthy and never married, Benett was an expert on fossils and stratigraphy in southwest England. She published books on her collection, supplied fossils to museums, and served as a reference for other geologists of her time. Because of her unusual first name, Benett was mistakenly granted a Doctorate of Civil Law from the University of St. Petersburg at a time when women were not admitted into higher education institutions. A sketch drawn by Etheldred Benett of a fossil sponge in her collection. Some fossils in her collection were the first to be illustrated and described; others were extremely rare or very well preserved. ( ) Mary Anning, a paleontologist and fossil collector, was the first to discover a complete skeleton of a . (The Geological Society of London convened a special meeting to discuss whether the fossil was a fake; Anning was not invited.) As a child, . Despite her reputation for finding and identifying fossils, the men who dominated the scientific community often did not acknowledge her work. Today, the Natural History Museum in London showcases several of Mary Anning’s finds. Portrait of Mary Anning with her dog, Tray, and the Golden Cap outcrop in the background ( ). This painting was owned by her brother Joseph, and presented to the museum in 1935 by Miss Annette Anning. Eliza Gordon-Cumming was a paleontologist and illustrator whose illustrations gained the attention of major fossil collectors. Her illustrations were so helpful that a paleontologist named a fossil fish for her ( ). She began collecting fossils from the quarry on her husband’s estate. Her finds in Louis Agassiz’s 1844 Monograph on Fossil Fish of the Old Red Sandstone. Her fossils are still regarded as important specimens, held in collections all around the world. Eliza Mary Campbell, Lady Gordon-Cumming, in a portrait by Henry Raeburn, between 1815 and 1823. ( ) Mary Horner Lyell as his partner in geology. While Charles investigated, she sketched geologic structures and cross-sections they discovered. Mary helped her husband research and catalog the rocks, minerals, and fossils they collected. Charles Lyell was an internationally recognized geologist, but couldn’t communicate with French, German, Spanish, or Swedish geologists without help from his wife. She acted as his interpreter with European geologists, as her fluency in four other languages allowed her to translate letters. Horner Lyell attended her husband’s talks as well as special lectures at the London Geological Society. A drawing of a portion of the Earth’s crust by Horner Lyell. ( ) While studying for her PhD at Johns Hopkins University, Bascom in the corner of the classroom so as to not disturb her male classmates. This made it hard for her to hear or see the lectures. After graduating, she became the second woman to earn her PhD in geology in the United States, after . In 1896, she became the first woman to work for the United States Geological Survey. She spent her summers doing fieldwork, analyzing her samples, and preparing maps during the academic year while in the geology program she created at Bryn Mawr College. Her best known work is her study of the Piedmont region of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Florence Bascom ca.1900. ( ) When Wilson retired at 65, . As a child, she collected fossils with her family and developed an interest in paleontology. While working alone on remote sites for the Geological Survey of Canada, she mapped over 14,000 square kilometers of the Ottawa-St. Lawrence Lowlands. She did this on foot or on a bicycle until she could buy her own car; the GSC would not grant her a vehicle like it did for its male geologists. In addition to her scientific achievements, she wrote a famous children’s book on geology called “The Earth Beneath our Feet.” A portrait of pioneering Canadian female geologist Alice Wilson. ( ) Eileen Guppy was the first female geologist in the British Geological Survey. , many women worked in roles that had been vacated by men who had been called to fight. Having already worked as a petrologist and analytical chemist for over twenty years, she was finally given the official title and responsibilities of a geologist in 1943. Three years later, Guppy was demoted as men returned to their pre-war roles. Her many contributions to British Geological Survey publications and reports are rarely credited. Portrait of British geologist Eileen Guppy. ( ) Winifred Goldring was the first female State Paleontologist in the United States. She from 1939 to 1954. She worked at the New York State Museum for over thirty years and was the museum’s first female curator. She had significant contributions to paleontology, including extensive work on in New York, and creating innovative museum exhibits. Goldring also served as president of the Paleontological Society and was vice president of the Geological Society in America in 1950. Winifred Goldring in a motorbike. ( ) Maria Vasilyevna Klenova was the to do research in Antarctica and was a contributor to the first Soviet Antarctic atlas. In 1933, she produced the first complete seabed map of the Barents Sea. During World War II, Klenova was appointed as head of the Laboratory of Marine Geology at the State Oceanographic Institute (GOIN) in the USSR. Her lab produced hundreds of maps that supported Soviet military operations. Several geographic features bear her name, such as Klenova Peak in Antarctica. A map of the Barents Sea. ( ) Dunbar began her career in sea-ice research working for the Government of Canada after emigrating to Canada in 1947. She taken at different times of the year to analyze ice conditions and determine the ice’s predicted position at different times of year. Dunbar also spent nearly 600 hours flying with the Canadian Air Force to study Arctic ice from the air. Dunbar retired in 1978, receiving many prestigious awards throughout her decades-long career.

Saruhashi was curious about science from a young age, according to a Massive Science article. After graduating from the Imperial Women’s College of Science, she studied carbon dioxide levels in seawater. Her method became a global standard for measuring carbon dioxide in seawater. She also discovered that the Pacific Ocean releases more carbon that it absorbs, a find that had huge implications regarding climate change. Saruhashi founded the Society of Japanese Women Scientists. Google doodle of Katsuko Saruhashi. ( ) Joanne Simpson was the first woman to receive a PhD in meteorology in the United States. She became interested in clouds as she in her youth. Simpson attended the University of Chicago, where Carl-Gustaf Rossby, a famous meteorologist, had recently set up an institute of meteorology. Rossby enrolled her as a teacher-in-training, and she taught meteorology to Aviation Cadets during World War II. After receiving her PhD, she conducted research at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts from 1948 to 1951, then at NOAA from 1964 to 1974. She finished her career at NASA, where her most significant work was as a project scientist for its Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission launched in 1997. In 1973 Joanne Simpson led the Florida Area Cumulus Experiment (FACE)—a NOAA program to enhance rainfall with cloud seeding. She is shown here aboard a NOAA Research Flight Facility C-130. (Photograph courtesy ) June Bacon-Bercey was the first on-air African-American female meteorologist. She was to minorities and women. In 1954, she became University of California Los Angeles’ first African-American woman to graduate with a degree in meteorology. She then accepted a position as a weather forecaster and analyst with NOAA’s National Weather Service. In 1971, she joined an NBC affiliate news channel as a science reporter. She co-founded the American Meteorological Society’s Board on Women and Minorities, and started a science fair program to encourage students of color and girls to pursue careers in science.

After graduating in 1946, Sanderson wanted to launch a field expedition to the Northwest Territories, the first climate experiment in the region. After defending her dissertation in 1965, she made many trips to the Arctic. These visits inspired her to offer a university course to interested indigenous students in environmental science. She was the first female geography professor in Canada, and the first female president of the Canadian Association of Geographers.

( ) Though many of these women faced significant challenges due to sexism, they were still able to make significant contributions in their respective fields. During Women’s History Month, it’s important to look back on the progress we’ve made regarding gender equality in the sciences, and yet look ahead to the work still to be done. According to the , only one-third of STEM workers are women. The achievements of these inspirational and intelligent women—and others who have yet to receive the recognition they deserve—can inspire today and tomorrow’s women scientists to persevere in the face of adversity.

        "content": "Imagine what it’s like: descending through the vibrant surface waters of the ocean where the sunlight can penetrate about 656 feet (200 meters) deep, then watching the colors slowly fade away as you pass into the ocean’s twilight zone where bizarre bioluminescent creatures creep. As you sink further, prepare for alien sensations: being swallowed into utter blackness and squeezed by the immense weight of the water. Bioluminescent Ctenophora (comb jellies) brighten the ocean depths where humans and human-made machines struggle to survive the water pressure. Image courtesy . A deep sea anglerfish attracts prey with its bioluminescent lure. Image courtesy . At 16,404 feet (5,000 meters) deep, you have reached the frontier of human knowledge: the zone, a Greek word that means “no bottom.” What happens down there? Life is sparse, but scientists suspect the deep ocean could be playing a major role in the Earth’s climate system. Climate scientists know that the ocean has stored about trapped by manmade greenhouse gases since 1955. Using data from a global array of Argo floats—aquatic robots that measure at different ocean depths--scientists have since learned that as air temperatures have increased in the atmosphere, the surface ocean has been taking up an increasing amount of heat. Yearly global ocean heat content compared to the 1958-65 average (dashed line at zero) for the past four decades for different layers of the ocean: from the surface to depths of 300 meters (grey) and 700 meters (blue), and total depth down to 2,000 meters (purple). Surface waters warmed more slowly (line is nearly flat since the mid-2000s) than deeper waters (steep increase). Since the core of the Argo fleet can only dive down to 2,000 meters, the amount of heat going into the deep ocean is unknown. Image adapted from Figure 1 of (pdf). But the fate of all the excess heat that has accumulated in the Earth’s climate system in the past half century has yet to be accounted for. Researchers suspect that currents have shifted it to the deep ocean, but they can’t test this hypothesis for sure: satellites cannot see under the skin of the ocean’s surface and the that form the core of the Argo fleet only dive to a depth of about 6,561 feet (2,000 meters). (To learn more about how Argo floats operate and take measurements, read of this series.) At depths below about 8,530 feet (2,600 meters), they implode under pressure...or they did until now. In coming decades, the bottom-dwellers of the ocean may have a new creature in their midst: a robotic, glass orb with an antenna to transmit signals to satellites and a two-meter long tail that detects when it has reached the sea floor. Unlike the last generation of Argo robots— —the new Deep Argo floats, designed by Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Teledyne-Webb Research, can withstand the crushing forces of the deep ocean. Steve Piotrowicz, Program Manager of the U.S. Argo program since 2000, has watched the float design evolve to a glass sphere over the past few years to deal with the challenges of deep-sea diving. A sphere is able to withstand much greater pressure than a cylinder because the pressure is distributed uniformly along the surface of the device, and glass is not only light and buoyant, but it withstands compression better than steel and titanium. Scientists launch a Deep Argo float during a research cruise in June 2014. A plastic case covers the Deep Argo glass flotation sphere containing machinery, circuitry, and batteries. Photo from LEARNZ , via . Deep Argo floats can safely deploy closer to the ocean floor without imploding. Drawing courtesy . Beyond the deep ocean, the floats are also able to operate in some of the most inhospitable environments on Earth, such as the frigid waters of the Southern Ocean. To keep from battering itself against the ice, the float conditions that indicate the surface ocean may have frozen over, and it will keep cycling below the surface until the ice retreats. The new design was put to the test aboard the Research Vessel operated by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research of New Zealand. Piotrowicz accompanied a team of oceanographers deploying two prototype Deep Argo floats into the ocean northeast of New Zealand. In this , the seafloor is very flat with few obstacles for the floats to navigate around or over, and there are no strong deep sea currents that could drive dramatic changes in temperature. Before the floats are deployed, the scientists first —“CTD” is an acronym for Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth. Based on a design that oceanographers have been using for decades, the CTD unit has 24 bottles attached to a large metal rosette wheel. The bottles collect water samples, while sensors at the bottom of the unit measure temperature, depth, and salinity. A data cable connects the device to a computer on the ship. Researchers with NOAA Fisheries use CTD devices to assess impacts of ocean conditions on fish populations. Image courtesy . The crew lowers the CTD unit down to the seafloor with a cable, and the scientists observe the water properties in real time. Once they have the CTD data for comparison, they deploy the new deep Argo floats. Immediately, the floats begin their descent to the abyss. The operational floats’ drift cycle—from the floats’ initial descent to the return to the surface, where they transmit their information to satellites—takes 10 days, but these test floats will have a 3-day cycle. In a year, when the floats are recovered, they will have experienced the equivalent of approximately four years of wear and tear of an operational float with a 10-day cycle. Already, the test floats are gathering some interesting information about circulation such as the direction and velocity of currents in the region where they were deployed. “Ultimately, though, we’re interested in the entire ocean,” Piotrowicz says. “You cannot disconnect one part of the ocean from the other part of the ocean.” All oceans are connected through the global conveyor belt, which is a planet-spanning circulation driven by places where surface water sinks due to relative changes in temperature, density, or salinity. Original drawing by , based on NASA and NODC data. Piotrowicz hopes that in years to come, Deep Argo will achieve global coverage, much like the present of generation of Argo floats. The fledgling U.S. Deep Argo program only has funding to deploy about 12 floats per year. To meet current science objectives, the global fleet will likely require on the order of a thousand floats. Meanwhile, the ocean’s great heat reservoir continues to churn. As the ocean takes up more heat, the temperature is rising and the volume of the water is increasing, raising sea level across the globe. Warming ocean waters also have potentially major implications for marine ecosystems, melting ice caps, and precipitation patterns. “Argo has been a game-changer for oceanographic science, and it’s only achieved global coverage since 2007,” Piotrowicz says. “With Deep Argo, we have the opportunity to take the science to the next level.” IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). 2013.

        "content": "Chicago is at the center of one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States: around 10 million residents live in the region, in neighborhoods that range from high-density housing to suburbs with yards and open space between single-family homes. Trees in yards and parks across the region provide some shade when temperatures rise, but the region's tree canopy—the percentage of the ground covered by tree branches and leaves—is lower than in many other cities in the Midwest. The loss of 13 million ash trees to an invasive insect, the emerald ash borer, has further reduced the canopy in many areas. The cost of removing and replacing ash trees has exhausted many municipal budgets in the region, leaving little money to care for the remaining trees or time to plan ahead. The Chicago region is already experiencing temperature increases, more heavy rain events, and local flooding that can all place further stress on urban trees. These impacts are expected to become even more pronounced in the years to come. Faced with the decline of urban trees, concerned groups joined together to form the Chicago Region Trees Initiative. Their goals were to improve management skills and knowledge, increase the region’s tree canopy, and incorporate species that are resistant to pests and the impacts of climate change. Resilient cities draw strength from their green spaces. Urban green space helps to cool cities during the summer, control storm water, and capture air pollutants. Green space can reduce stress and neighborhood crime, and it provides places for neighbors to forge strong connections. Healthy and empowered communities are better equipped to deal with change in a positive way. Those benefits motivated the Chicago Region Trees Initiative to partner with Leslie Brandt, a climate change specialist with the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science and the U.S. Forest Service, to confront the decline in urban trees. Their goal was to assess the vulnerability of the region’s trees to climate change and other factors, and then move on to consider strategies for adaptation. The partners used habitat suitability modeling, projected changes in heat and hardiness zones, and an assessment of tree species' adaptive capacity to assess the vulnerability of more than 150 tree species that are currently growing or recommended for planting in the region. The assessment showed that some of the least vulnerable trees in the region are non-native invasive species. Conversely, results indicated that many of the species native to the area are vulnerable to changing conditions. After losing many of its ash trees, the Village of Riverside in Chicago replaced some of them with resilient species such as buckeye and pecan. Image Credit: Michael Collins, Village of Riverside.

Representatives from counties, municipalities, and park districts worked with experts in climate change adaptation in a series of workshops on urban forest vulnerability and adaptation. Using a structured process, they evaluated which impacts and adaptive-capacity factors had the largest effects on vulnerability. Finally, they implemented a five-step adaptation project to incorporate climate change considerations into real-world projects and planning efforts, which included planting resilient trees. The Chicago Region Trees Initiative is integrating climate change-related goals into a regional tree master plan and updating its recommended planting list to encourage climate-adapted species. Members of the Chicago Regional Trees Initiative teach proper planting and tree care for communities that may not have a trained forester or arborist on staff.

Communities across the Chicago region are working to incorporate vulnerability information and adaptation strategies in their work. Looking to the future, the initiative is seeking grant funding they will use to create real-world demonstrations of adaptation that resulted from the workshops.

        "content": "Climate Literacy: Essential Principles for Understanding and Addressing Climate Change presents information that is important for individuals and communities to know and understand about Earth’s climate, the impacts of climate change, and solutions. Principles in the guide can serve as discussion starters or launching points for learning about the climate crisis and what’s being done to address it across the world. The guide aims to promote greater climate literacy by providing this educational and communication framework of principles and concepts. Artist's statement: “Climate change has compressed and conflated human and geologic time scales, making it essential to find ways to conceptualize 'deep time.' This work seeks to make notions of deep time comprehensible through visual exploration of glacier ice, as well as other earthly archives. This project includes intimate collaborations with paleoclimatologists by having them annotate directly onto my photographic prints—a contemporary taxonomy of ice and climate. This portrait was photographed in a cold/clean lab at Montana State University. The ice shown is 10,827 (left side) to 10,833 years old.” Credit: Art x Climate, Ian Van Coller, Dr. Avila Holding Cut Antarctic Icecore, (2017, pigment print on washi with annotations) A. Climate is not the same thing as weather. Weather is the minute-by-minute condition of the atmosphere (such as temperature and precipitation) on a local scale. Climate is the long-term average weather conditions of an area. The term climate change refers to significant and persistent change in an area’s average climate conditions or their extremes. B. The components and processes of Earth’s climate system are governed by the laws of science. Therefore, the behavior of the climate system can be understood and modeled through careful, systematic study. Our understanding of the climate system will only continue to improve as science advances. C. To learn about how climate has changed in the distant past, scientists use natural records, such as tree rings, ice cores, and sedimentary layers. Indigenous Knowledges and historical observations such as personal journals also document past climate change. D. Scientific observations indicate that the global climate varies over time; it has changed in the past, is changing now, and will change in the future. The natural processes driving Earth’s long-term climate variability, such as changes in solar energy reaching Earth, do not explain the rapid climate change observed in recent decades. The only credible explanation for recent climate change is human activities. E. The magnitude and trends of climate change are not the same at all locations on Earth. For example, the land warms faster than the ocean, and the polar regions warm faster than the tropics. F. Research into past climate changes has shown that there are parts of the Earth system that change gradually until they reach a tipping point, after which they change more quickly. Some of these changes may be irreversible. The risk of crossing these tipping points increases as climate change intensifies. Ecosystems, ice sheets, and ocean currents may all have tipping points. G. Climate models have been constructed using observational data and physical laws. These models can project a range of potential future climate conditions that result from different assumptions about the future, such as the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Models that include both human and natural systems examine how climate impacts cascade across sectors and scales and, in turn, how human systems and choices influence climate. H. Integrated approaches that bring together knowledge from many contexts and areas of study are essential to understanding the full picture of climate change. Considering the perspective of only a single sector, topic, or region may cause climate impacts or solutions to be overlooked. I. Coproduced climate change research projects integrate both community-based and science-based insights and solutions to climate change. Coproduced research often includes experts within relevant knowledge contexts, such as Indigenous Knowledge holders or multigenerational farming communities. This kind of research can give rise to community-based climate solutions. Artist’s statement: “My drawing depicts 11 endangered species and their different ecosystems found in the Western United States. The most difficult challenge was making this piece cohesive, even across different habitats that normally wouldn’t be found together. I live in Boise, Idaho, and am surrounded by wild places that I consider part of my home. I want to ensure that these ecosystems are protected. I hope viewers come away with an appreciation for our Western wild places and the importance of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems threatened by climate change and habitat loss.” Credit: Taelyn B., Art x Climate, Endangered West, (2022, colored pencil) A. Nearly all the energy that flows through the Earth system comes from sunlight. Earth’s climate is determined by the movement of energy through the Earth system—the ocean, atmosphere, clouds, ice, land, and life—and also includes energy and heat produced by humans and human activity. B. Some of the sunlight that reaches Earth is reflected back to space by Earth’s atmosphere and surface, but about 70% of it is absorbed by the atmosphere, land, and ocean. The warmed Earth radiates heat back into the atmosphere, where the heat is absorbed by greenhouse (also known as heat-trapping) gases that radiate some of this heat back toward Earth. This leads to the overall heating of Earth’s surface—known as the greenhouse effect. C. Greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere by human activities intensify the greenhouse effect and drive global warming. The greenhouse gases produced by human activities include carbon dioxide (CO ), methane (CH ), nitrous oxide (N O), and fluorinated gases. D. Water vapor (H O) also traps heat, and a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture than a cooler one. As a result, water vapor amplifies the warming caused by the addition of human-produced greenhouse gases. E. Some greenhouse gases are more effective at warming the planet than others. The heat-trapping ability of a greenhouse gas, plus how much of it is in the atmosphere and how long it endures, determines its contribution to total warming. For example, even though there is about 200 times more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than methane, and carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for much longer, methane has contributed 20% to 30% of global warming to date. F. Life—including microbes, plants, animals, and humans—is a major driver of the global carbon cycle and can influence global climate by modifying the chemical makeup of the atmosphere. The geologic record shows that life has significantly altered the atmosphere during Earth’s history. G. Carbon naturally moves very slowly between the atmosphere and reservoirs in the Earth, including rocks, soils, and the deep ocean. Human activities are disrupting this cycle by taking carbon out of storage underground and releasing it into the atmosphere, primarily by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. H. While some of these human-caused carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed quickly by the ocean and forests, much of the carbon dioxide will remain in the atmosphere before it is absorbed by the ocean over thousands of years. I. As concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases increase, Earth’s average temperature rises in response. This rise in temperature causes a significant change in the climate averages and extremes that people and the natural environment experience. Human-produced greenhouse gases have intensified Earth's natural greenhouse effect by changing the balance between the amount of sunlight that reaches the surface and the amount of heat that escapes the atmosphere. CREDIT: NOAA Climate Program Office, Graphic by Anna Eshelman A. Human activities have unequivocally caused the global warming observed over the industrial era by increasing the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. B. Three-quarters of all greenhouse gases emitted by human activities come from the use of fossil fuels, primarily coal, oil, and natural gas, for transportation and energy. The rest come from industrial processes, agriculture, landfills, and land-use changes such as deforestation. C. Social systems—including institutions, policies, practices, values, and behaviors—determine the amount of greenhouse gases emitted. Social systems also inequitably distribute the economic benefits of energy consumption and the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. D. The global climate will continue to warm in the future. How much it warms depends primarily on current and future emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities. By far the biggest uncertainty in terms of future climate change is the human factor—how much action global society will take to limit greenhouse gas emissions. E. Many of the human activities that produce greenhouse gases also produce small airborne particles called aerosols. Aerosols generally cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space, and by seeding clouds that reflect sunlight. This cooling effect is currently not big enough to fully counteract human-caused warming. Most human-produced aerosols, such as smoke from power plants and biomass burning, also have negative effects on air quality and human health. F. Human activities continue to increase the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, although contributions vary across regions, sectors, and populations. G. Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries or longer. This means that carbon dioxide emitted decades ago continues to contribute to climate change today. Among countries, the United States is the largest emitter of the carbon dioxide that has accumulated in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. From 1850 to 2021, total emissions from the United States are estimated to have caused around 17% of global warming, China 12%, European Union 10%, and the 47 least-developed countries collectively 6%. H. Annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have been slowly declining since 2007, while emissions have increased rapidly in China, India, and other nations with rapidly industrializing economies. China is currently the top annual emitter as a nation. I. Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases can limit future global warming and its impacts. Parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement set a goal of holding the global average temperature to well below 2°C (3.6°F) above preindustrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F). J. The Paris Agreement also sets an aim to make financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. However, public and private financial systems continue to support investment in fossil fuels. Currently, global spending on fossil fuels outweighs investments in adaptation and mitigation. Current investments in reducing greenhouse gas emissions are not large enough to keep warming below 2°C (3.6°F).

Credit: U.S. Forest Service A. As of 2021, Earth had warmed by about 1.1°C (2°F) above preindustrial levels. Most of this warming has occurred since 1980. The current rate of warming is roughly 30 times faster than the rate at which Earth warmed as it emerged from the last ice age. B. The last time the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was as high as it is today was about 3.2 million years ago, when the world was significantly warmer and sea levels were between 18 and 63 feet (5.5 to 19 meters) higher than today. C. Human societies developed over the past 10,000 years during a very stable period in Earth's climate history. The rapid rise in temperatures and resulting climate changes since 1980 mean that the economic, transportation, agricultural, and social systems we rely on are vulnerable. D. Climate change is already increasing the severity, geographic scale, and frequency of extreme events, such as heatwaves, floods, strong storms, droughts, and wildfires around the United States and the world. As the world warms, these events will become even more extreme, worsening existing social inequalities and leading to greater health, resource, and migration challenges. Existing societal challenges, intensified by increasing climate change, will exacerbate the drivers of instability and threaten both national and global security. To deal with the direct effects of extreme events, as well as the increased instability resulting from them, the need for humanitarian assistance will increase worldwide. E. Globally, a warmer atmosphere holds more total water vapor, and some areas will get wetter. Warmer air with more water vapor also causes heavier rainfall during storms, which can lead to flooding. However, over many regions, temperature changes will outpace the effects of increases in humidity, making dry places even drier and droughts more intense. F. Changing precipitation and snowmelt patterns are altering the distribution of Earth’s freshwater and the timing of runoff. Droughts are becoming more frequent and severe in many regions, while, at the same time, extreme precipitation events are becoming more frequent and intense in other regions. Some regions are experiencing both—more frequent or severe droughts in the summer, and more extreme precipitation events in the winter. These and other climate change impacts threaten the quality and reliability of water supplies. G. Global warming is causing the global average sea level to rise. As ocean water warms, it expands, taking up more space. Water from melting land ice is also being added to the ocean, raising sea levels. As the sea level rises, salt water contaminates coastal freshwater sources, damages coastal homes and infrastructure, harms coastal ecosystems, and inundates islands and low-lying land. Sea level rise also increases the risk of damage to buildings and infrastructure from high tide flooding and storm surge. H. The ocean has slowed climate change by absorbing huge amounts of heat and carbon. About 90% of the warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the ocean, altering its global circulation patterns and threatening marine life. The ocean has also taken up 25% of all carbon dioxide produced by human activities, making it more acidic and leading to harmful impacts on marine species, food webs, and coastal economies. As climate change continues, the ocean’s capacity to store heat and carbon is likely to weaken, reducing its ability to buffer the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. I. All species, including humans, survive within specific ranges of temperature, precipitation, humidity, sunlight, and other climate conditions. Organisms exposed to climate conditions outside their normal ranges must adapt or move elsewhere, or they may face negative health impacts. If climate conditions sufficiently alter a species’ habitat, consequences can include extinction. Changes to the abundance of different species can threaten the stability and survival of their ecosystems. J. As local climate conditions change, many organisms, including animals, plants, and microbes, are attempting to move to areas with more favorable conditions. However, their movement can be limited or prevented by natural barriers such as mountains, human-built infrastructure such as roads, or competition with other species. The timings of blooms, migrations, and hibernations have changed and will continue to change, sometimes dramatically, potentially altering food webs and spreading infectious diseases. These processes disrupt existing ecosystems and can threaten the survival of entire species, biomes, and human livelihoods. K. The impacts of climate change and other stressors may drive people to leave their homes temporarily or permanently, either within the same country or across a border. For example, rising temperatures and shifting rainfall could lead to increased crop failures, compelling farmers to seek more reliable livelihoods in nearby cities or neighboring regions. Climate migration is one type of human migration, which can have many complex causes and impacts. If migration is sudden and unplanned, it may increase demand for scarce resources and potentially exacerbate tension between migrants and local communities. Governments may also struggle to provide adequate services amid large-scale displacement. L. Climate change negatively impacts human health through more frequent and severe extreme heat and other extreme events; increased transmission of infectious and vector-borne diseases; declines in food and water security; and degraded air and water quality. Exposure to extreme events can result in feelings of vulnerability, uncertainty, and anxiety or depression, with negative impacts on mental health. Marginalized and low-income populations tend to be more exposed to climate hazards and associated health impacts than other groups. M. Climate change can harm businesses, governments, and economies through costly disruptions to services and supply chains, damage to infrastructure, and lost productivity. At the same time, climate solutions will create new economic opportunities for organizations.

With careful planning and execution, actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate risks can be carried out in ways that promote climate justice in the United States, which involves ensuring benefits from climate action are shared equitably and fairly. Achieving sustainable outcomes that promote equity in the United States, rather than exacerbate inequities, involves understanding how the impacts of and responses to climate change affect different groups of people, including those who have been marginalized and underserved. Including affected communities in decision-making can help reduce risks and distribute benefits equitably. B. Climate change is both a product of society and a force that is shaping it. Its effects both reflect and exacerbate existing social inequities, with some people and communities suffering disproportionate harm. Societies can help address these issues by acknowledging the intersections between climate change and key social challenges, such as those relating to racial, economic, and gender inequity; rural communities; public health; migration; and ecosystem health. C. Although climate change affects everyone, marginalized and underserved communities are more likely to experience harmful impacts. The long-lasting effects of discriminatory investment practices, unequal distribution of resources, and exclusionary laws have pushed Indigenous communities, communities of color, and low-income communities into locations where they are more vulnerable to climate change. These communities are often overburdened, experiencing one or more types of environmental injustice in the form of disproportionate health-related impacts from fossil fuel-based energy systems, reduced capacity to prepare for and recover from extreme events, settlement in hotter or more flood-prone areas, or lower-quality infrastructure and services. D. Certain groups of people are at higher risk of negative health impacts from climate change. Those likely to experience elevated health impacts include the very young, the very old, people with disabilities or chronic health conditions, low-income individuals and communities, and other marginalized communities. E. Rural communities face unique challenges from climate change. Rural areas are often under-resourced and therefore less resilient to climate impacts. Climate change also worsens stressors they already face, including physical isolation, limited economic diversity, and higher poverty rates, combined with an aging population. At the same time, rural communities are key to many climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, from climate-smart agricultural practices, to new sources of renewable energy, to restoring critical habitats for wildlife. F. Indigenous Peoples hold unique knowledges and experiences about how to live sustainably on their lands. Their ways of life are threatened as local climates change and the ecosystems they rely on are altered. Tribal education systems are engaged in building community resilience and supporting the next generation of climate leaders. G. An equitable and sustainable U.S. response to climate change has the potential to reduce climate impacts while improving well-being, strengthening resilience, benefiting the economy, and, in part, redressing legacies of racism, injustice, and inequity within the nation. H. Participatory research and planning processes can help reduce inequities and the chances of causing unintended harm through climate actions. Taking inclusive and equitable approaches to addressing climate change in the United States requires that the characteristics of a community, the factors that shaped them, and the interests of those affected are central to designing and implementing climate solutions. Approaches to decision-making that are based on broad and meaningful participation by all affected groups can build trust, promote social cohesion, and increase support, implementation, and efficacy for adaptation and mitigation strategies and plans. I. A just transition within the United States is the process of responding to climate change with transformative actions that address the root causes of climate vulnerability while ensuring equitable access to decent work and quality jobs; affordable, low-carbon energy; environmental benefits such as reduced air pollution; and improved quality of life for all. This type of transition has the potential to enable more ambitious, effective, and lasting adaptation, resilience, and mitigation actions, including by creating good-paying jobs in renewable energy industries. Artist's statement: “This piece was commissioned by the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group. Developed in collaboration with scientists and tribal representatives, the work acknowledges the inevitable while highlighting how we can cultivate good. From the urban West Coast to the shrubsteppe of eastern Washington, resiliency looks different in every landscape. True resiliency is not bound within the realm of science; social justice is equally as vital to every solution. The piece aims to make climate resiliency concepts more accessible. After all, before any goal can be accomplished, it must first be envisioned.” Credit: Claire Seaman, Art x Climate, Imagining Climate Resiliency in the Pacific Northwest (2021, oil on canvas) A. Adapting and building resilience to climate impacts in all aspects of society saves lives; reduces structural, environmental, and economic damage; protects natural resources; helps preserve cultures; and often results in improved quality of life. B. Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for reducing the risks of climate change. Taking actions to adapt and build resilience to current and future extreme events and other climate changes, while dramatically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, will also reduce loss of life and property and limit damage to ecosystems and human health. C. Adaptation will become more expensive and less effective as the planet warms. Building a costly seawall today, for example, will be insufficient if water levels rise above the height of the wall in the future. Without mitigation, there will come a time when the impacts of climate change overwhelm our capacity to adapt. D. Current adaptation efforts and investments are insufficient to address today’s risks and keep pace with future climate change. Adequate adaptation would involve not only scaling up efforts across a wider range of actors, sectors, and systems, but also more transformative adaptation involving profound shifts in our institutions, behaviors, values, or technologies. For example, transformative actions could shift housing development to less flood-prone areas to account for rising seas, or redesign buildings and cities to manage heat extremes. E. People may be able to adapt and reduce their vulnerability in different ways, depending on their circumstances. For example, some communities and individuals may move to higher ground to avoid flooding and rising sea levels, choose crops that will thrive under new climate conditions, develop nature-based solutions such as restoring vegetation to lessen storm impacts, and adopt new technologies or building standards suited for new weather extremes. However, the ability to adapt may be limited by the capacity of a community or individual to address changing conditions, or by a risk or hazard exposure that is too great to overcome. F. There is no one-size-fits-all model for adaptation and improved resilience. Adaptation will look different in different communities because risks, judgments about risk, resources, and potential solutions differ across groups of people and the places where they live and work. G. Actions that increase risks are called maladaptation. For example, maladaptation can occur if infrastructure (like a levee or roadway) or a disaster response program encourages continued development in hazardous areas, leading to higher losses in the event of future disasters. Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence. H. A fair, democratic, and community-based approach to assessing risks and planning adaptation measures can reduce the chances of unintentionally causing more harm to natural systems and the people who are affected by these decisions. I. Adaptation often requires financial investment in new or enhanced technologies, infrastructure, and education. Investing in adaptation and resilience efforts undertaken by vulnerable populations can contribute to a more equitable future.

Rapid, deep, and sustained reductions in global emissions of greenhouse gases can still limit global temperature changes to well below 2°C (3.6°F), consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. B. Limiting global warming requires net-zero carbon dioxide emissions— where emissions fall to zero or remaining emissions are balanced by removal from the atmosphere. To keep warming to well below 2°C (3.6°F), global carbon dioxide emissions would need to reach net zero by 2050, along with substantial reductions in emissions of all greenhouse gases. Rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are one of the fastest ways to limit near-term warming. C. Reaching and sustaining global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions will result in a gradual decline in warming. However, some long-term responses to warming that have already occurred will continue due to the long lifespan of some greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (for example, sea level rise, ice sheet losses, and ecosystem disruptions). D. Actively removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and using natural climate solutions to increase ecosystem carbon sinks can help reach net zero even faster. Scientists, entrepreneurs, and communities are working on ways to remove some of these greenhouse gases. E. Many countries, states, cities, and corporations have set climate mitigation goals and targets that are aligned with limiting warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F). However, current efforts to meet these goals and targets need to be scaled up and expanded to limit global warming, and it remains likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C (2.7°F) during the 21st century. F. Technologies and approaches that are already available can dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the highest-emitting sectors. These include improvements in energy efficiency, electricity generation from solar and wind energy, electrification of transportation and heating, less emissions-intensive diets, and protection and restoration of forests and ecosystems. G. Some other greenhouse gas emissions, such as those from jet fuel, cement production, and certain industrial processes, cannot be avoided at a large scale with current technologies. To reach net-zero emissions, additional mitigation options and approaches, such as natural and engineered carbon dioxide removal and low-carbon fuels, may need to be explored. H. Actions by governments, businesses, organizations, and individuals can support net-zero emissions goals. Artist’s statement: “In my art, I try to convey that we can help reverse the effects of climate change. One hand is erasing the pollution caused by industrialization the world over, and the other is redrawing actions to restore the Earth’s beauty. I have always tried to help out the Earth, through stream clean ups and more. I hope people learn from my art that they can help change the world by just doing simple things like driving less, not littering, and maybe even setting up solar panels or wind turbines. The effects of climate change are only in our hands, so we should do whatever we can to help.” Credit: Ritika S., Art x Climate, Redrawing the Earth (2023, colored pencil) A. How quickly global carbon dioxide emissions reach net zero will largely determine how much warming can be limited. Every increment of warming that the world avoids reduces the risks and harmful impacts of climate change, including loss of life. Acting sooner on mitigation and adaptation will reduce future warming and associated impacts and produce environmental, economic, and social benefits. B. Parties to the Paris Agreement set a collective goal to limit global warming to well below 2°C (3.6°F) above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) above preindustrial levels. To meet this goal, countries, companies, communities, and organizations need to implement more ambitious mitigation actions. C. Even if the world rapidly reaches net-zero emissions, the United States will continue to face climate impacts and risks. Adequately addressing these risks involves longer-term inclusive planning, investments in transformative adaptation, and mitigation approaches that consider equity and justice. D. Inclusive, equitable, and just approaches to climate action in the United States can help reduce risks, improve outcomes, encourage ambitious mitigation, and create opportunities to overcome past environmental inequities. Supporting Indigenous and local knowledge holders and their practices can lead to more resilient and sustainable outcomes. E. Human well-being is dependent on natural and managed ecosystems, which provide crucial functions and resources for nearly everything we eat, make, and do. Nature-based solutions can provide climate adaptation and mitigation benefits, protecting ecosystems and the services they provide while also benefiting people. F. Improving climate education, increasing access to information, and communicating effectively can improve people’s understanding of risks and their ability to address them. G. Taking constructive climate action together with other people helps reduce eco-anxiety and builds a stronger sense of community. H. Substantially reducing human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and taking actions to adapt and build resilience involves all levels of society. Actions by individuals, organizations, businesses, and governments can support adaptation and mitigation goals. In the United States, states, cities, Tribes, companies, and other organizations have adopted a range of climate actions and policies. I. Millions of people all over the world are already working to make a safer, healthier, more prosperous, more just, and more stable world for all through climate action.

Sabemos que este calentamiento es causado en gran parte por las actividades humanas porque el papel clave que desempeña el dióxido de carbono en el mantenimiento del efecto invernadero natural de la Tierra ha sido comprendido desde mediados del siglo XIX. A menos que sea compensado por alguna influencia de enfriamiento igualmente grande, más dióxido de carbono atmosférico conducirá a temperaturas más cálidas en la superficie. Desde 1800, la cantidad de dióxido de carbono en la atmósfera cerca de 280 partes por millón a 410 ppm en 2019. Sabemos, tanto por su rápido aumento como por su \"huella\" isotópica, que la fuente de este nuevo dióxido de carbono son los combustibles fósiles, y no las fuentes naturales como los incendios forestales, los volcanes o la emisión de gases del océano.

        "content": "July 2024 was the warmest July on record for the globe in NOAA's 175-year record. The July global surface temperature was 1.21°C (2.18°F) above the 20th-century average of 15.8°C (60.4°F). This is 0.03°C (0.05°F) warmer than the previous July record set last year, and the 14th consecutive month of record-high global temperatures. This breaks the longest record warm global temperature streak in the modern record (since 1980) previously set from May 2015—May 2016. July 2024 marked the 48th consecutive July with global temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th-century average. There have been 14 consecutive months of record-hot global temperatures, spanning from June 2023 through July 2024. This breaks the previous record (May 2015 through May 2016) for longest record-warm global temperature streak in modern record (since 1980). Each month of record global temperatures, compared to the 1991-2020 average, is shown in sequence. Places that were warmer than average are red; places that were cooler than average are blue. Image by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. Climatologically, July is the warmest month of the year. As the warmest July on record, July 2024 was more likely than not the warmest month on record for the globe since 1850. The past ten Julys have been the warmest Julys on record. The global land-only July temperature also was warmest on record at 1.70°C (3.06°F) above average. The ocean-only temperature was second-warmest at 0.98°C (1.76°F) above average, ending a streak of 15 consecutive monthly record highs that stretched from April 2023—June 2024. These temperatures occurred under ENSO-neutral conditions. According to , ENSO-neutral is expected to continue for the next several months, with during September-November (66% chance) and persist through the Northern Hemisphere winter 2024-25 (74% chance during November-January). Record-warm July temperatures covered large parts of northern and southern Africa, southeastern Europe and large parts of Asia, as well as areas of the western U.S. and western Canada. In North America areas of anomalous warmth stretched from northwest Mexico through much of the western U.S., the northern Plains and states on the Eastern Seaboard, as well as much of Canada, where anomalies greater than 3.0°C (5.4°F) were widespread. Much-warmer-than-average to record July temperatures covered most all of Greenland, where temperatures were more than 4°C (7.2°F) above average in many places. During July 2024, 13.8% of the world's surface had a record-high July temperature, exceeding the previous July record set in 2023 by 5.4%. Close to one-fifth (19.2%) of the global land surface had a record-high July temperature. Meanwhile, 0.3% of the global land and ocean surface experienced a record-cold July temperature. In South America temperatures were warmer than average from southern Brazil through northern parts of the continent and Central America. However, Argentina and neighboring countries had cooler than average July mean temperatures. Cold air outbreaks from Antarctica brought periods of extremely cold daily temperatures, resulting in associated with the anomalous weather. Other areas with cooler-than-normal temperatures in July included large parts of central and eastern Australia, the Russian Far East, parts of southern Africa, much of Alaska and parts of the central U.S. The cold outbreaks in southern South America were associated with that allowed cold air to move northward during the month. Over Antarctica, particularly central and eastern areas, the weak polar vortex led to extremely warm daily temperatures during the latter part of the month, as the northward surging cold air was replaced by widespread occurrences of daily temperatures more than 10°C (18°F) above average. For the month-as-a-whole, covered large parts of the Antarctic continent, and for the Antarctic region as a whole, the month tied July 1991 as the . Other areas with anomalous warmth included a region that stretched from Southwest Asia through most of China and Mongolia into central Russia. In parts of the Persian Gulf region, heat indices reached extreme levels in July as mid-summer temperatures exceeding 40.5°C (105°F) and Gulf water temperatures above 32°C (90°F) brought a combination of high humidity and heat that produced . The heat index in Dubai climbed as high as 62°C (143°F to 144°F), as reached the mid-30s°C (mid-90s°F). Global showed a heat index near 69°C (149°F) at the Persian Gulf International airport in Asaluyeh on July 17. In eastern Europe monthly mean temperatures more than +2°C (+3.6°F) warmer-than-average were widespread and the July mean temperature was more than 1°C (1.8°F) above average in much of southern Europe. In Spain and other countries along the Mediterranean, July heat waves brought multi-day temperatures exceeding 38°C (100°F). This led to in some areas and reports of . Temperatures were even hotter in Morocco, where daily high temperatures exceeded 41°C (106°F) . Researchers from found that the severity of the heatwave in this region in the absence of climate change. Over the global oceans covered large parts of the equatorial and northern Atlantic, although the expanse of record-breaking temperatures was less than in . The continued to be record warm in July. Across the global ocean, 11.3% of its surface had a record-high temperature for the month. Only 0.05% of the global ocean was record cold in July. Widespread areas of below-average July sea surface temperatures were largely confined to the southeastern Pacific and adjacent areas of the Southern Ocean. Areas of the far northern Pacific also were cooler than average for July. In the Northern Hemisphere, July 2024 also was warmest on record at 1.51°C (2.72°F) above average. This is 0.01°C (0.02°F) warmer than July 2023. The Northern Hemisphere land temperature also ranked warmest on record for the month, while the Northern Hemisphere Ocean temperature was second warmest for July. The Southern Hemisphere also experienced its warmest July on record at 0.91°C (1.64°F) above average, 0.05°C (0.09°F) warmer than 2023. The Southern Hemisphere land temperature and ocean temperature for July were both individually second warmest on record.

Places that received more precipitation than average are colored green; places that received less precipitation than average are colored brown. Gray areas represent missing data. Image by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. July was drier-than-average in areas that included most of the western contiguous U.S. and Hawaii, much of southern Europe and eastern Europe, parts of central Asia, and much of northern and western Australia. Areas that were wetter-than-average included much of the state of Alaska, a large part of the central U.S. and parts of the southeastern U.S., western and northern Europe, a large part of central Asia and southeast Asia including India, eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, parts of central and south-central Australia, and much of the of Western Africa.

Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (University of Maryland). This July we were in based on central Pacific Ocean SSTs [sea surface temperatures]. The precipitation anomaly [difference from the long-term average] pattern showed a strong South Asian Monsoon with heavy rain over the Indian and peninsulas, across the Philippines and into the western Pacific. The general positive anomaly over this large area might be thought of as consistent with a La Nina-type pattern, however , show it to be actually a little more like the El Nino composite [a map made by layering multiple maps of the same phenomenon over a span of time, such as precipitation for every July when there was an El Niño event] pattern. The pattern correlation numbers between this July’s anomaly pattern and the ENSO composites have the correlations remaining near zero, indicating the lack of overall ENSO effect on precipitation patterns this month. With the ENSO effect being very subdued, are the remaining anomaly patterns for this July due to something else or just random? Comparing this July’s anomaly pattern with the trend pattern, one can discern some similarities. In fact, the spatial correlation between the two fields is not very big, but much bigger than the near zero ENSO effects this month. In other words, the effect of global warming is showing up (to some extent) in the July anomaly field, when it is not masked by ENSO effects. The very active South Asian monsoon provided a wealth of rainfall to the Asian region, with associated occurrences of floods and landslides. This included the effects of an early season tropical cyclone, , which flooded parts of the Philippine islands, before tracking over Taiwan and into China and then affecting North Korea late in the month. Taiwan had a peak rainfall of over 1000 mm. Over 100 deaths were recorded due to the storm. Even before Gaemi, northeastern China had a bout of flooding early in the month. India also had above average July rainfall, with the state of Kerala along the southwest coast suffering landslides and floods with over 100 dead. Africa also shows an active band of rainfall with an above-normal east-west feature across the continent centered at about 15°N. At the east end of that feature, landslides killed over 200 in Ethiopia. The Atlantic hurricane season is just beginning and early in the month the second named storm, , hit Jamaica, crossed the Yucatan Peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico and hit Texas causing significant flooding in Houston and knocking out power there for over a week. And its remnants even caused a couple of days later. On the monthly scale Beryl helped to provide the positive rainfall anomaly across the southeast U.S., although the Mid-Atlantic states (e.g., Maryland) this month. In the western U.S. conditions were dry, with below normal rainfall, and there were a number of wildfires, e.g., in Oregon, California and Colorado, and also in western Canada. Drought conditions extended into eastern Canada. Over western Europe moderate conditions prevailed, but with negative rain anomalies extending from southeastern Europe northeastward above the Black Sea into northern Eurasia. South America was covered almost completely by negative anomalies. Help us improve our content"

The report is another signpost to current and future generations.” Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide⁠—Earth’s major atmospheric ⁠—once again reached record high concentrations in 2023. Annual growth in global mean CO2 has increased from 0.6±0.1 ppm yr−1 in the early 1960s to an average of 2.5 ppm yr−1 during the last decade of 2014–23. The growth from 2022 to 2023 was 2.8 ppm, the fourth highest in the record since the 1960s. The three dominant greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere—carbon dioxide (left), methane (center), and nitrous oxide (right)—all reached new highs in 2023.

A range of scientific analyses indicate that the annual global surface temperature was 0.99 to 1.08 of a degree F (0.55 to 0.60 of a degree C) above the 1991–2020 average. This makes , surpassing the previous record of 2016 by 0.23 to 0.31 of a degree F (0.13 to 0.17 of a degree C). The transition in the Pacific Ocean from La Niña at the beginning of the year to a strong El Niño by the end of the year contributed to the record warmth. All seven major global temperature datasets used for analysis in the report agree that the last nine years (2015–23) were the nine warmest on record. The at an average rate of 0.14 to 0.16 of a degree F (0.08 to 0.09 of a degree C) per decade since 1880, and at a rate more than twice as high since 1981.

The mean annual global sea-surface temperature in 2023 was record high, surpassing the previous record of 2016 by 0.23 of a degree F (0.13 of a degree C). Each month from June to December was record warm. On August 22, an all-time high globally averaged daily sea-surface temperature of 66.18 degrees F (18.99 degrees C) was recorded. Surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean in December 2023 compared to average ( ) showing the swath of warmer-than-average waters across the equatorial Pacific near the peak of NOAA Climate.gov image from our based on Coral Reef Watch data from NOAA View. Approximately 94 percent of the ocean surface experienced at least one marine heatwave , which is defined as sea-surface temperatures in the warmest 10 percent of all recorded data in a particular location on that day for at least five days. The eastern tropical and , the Sea of Japan, the Arabian Sea, the Southern Ocean near New Zealand, and the eastern tropical Pacific, were in a marine heatwave state for at least 10 months of 2023. The ocean experienced a new global average record of 116 marine heatwave days in 2023, which was far more than the previous record of 86 days in 2016, and a new record of 13 marine cold spell days, far below the previous record of 37 days in 1982. This map shows the number of months each part of the global ocean experienced heat wave conditions in 2023, meaning that for a given time of year, the monthly average temperatures were in the hottest 10 percent of all monthly temperatures from 1991-2020. Very few areas experienced less than one full month of heat wave conditions (darkest blue). Relatively large swaths of the eastern North Atlantic experienced heat wave conditions virtually all year (bright yellow). NOAA Climate.gov image, adapted from Figure SB3.1 in . Over the past half-century, the oceans have stored more than 90 percent of the excess energy trapped in Earth’s system by greenhouse gases and other factors. The global ocean heat content, measured from the ocean’s surface to a depth of 2000 meters (over 6,500 feet), . Global mean sea level was record high for the 12th-consecutive year, reaching about 4.0 inches (101.4 millimeters) above the 1993 average when satellite altimetry measurements began. This rise is an increase of 0.3±0.1 of an inch (8.1±1.5 millimeters) over 2022, the third highest year-over-year increase on record. This map shows the frequency of extreme humid heat worldwide in 2023 compared to the 1991-2023 average. Extreme humid heat is defined as a day when the maximum wet-bulb temperature is in the highest 10 percent on record from 1991-2020. The map compares the frequency of these days in 2023 to their normal frequency at that location from 1991-2020. Places that are darkest red experienced 60 or more days of extreme humid heat—2 months—more than average. Places where the frequency of extreme humid heat was less than average are colored blue.

During late spring and a record-warm summer, approximately 37 million acres burned across Canada, an area more than twice the size of Ireland and more than double the previous record from 1989. Approximately 232,000 people were evacuated due to the threat of wildfires, and impacted regions across Canada and also affected the heavily populated cities of New York City and Chicago, and even areas of western Europe. With August to October 2023 being the driest three-month period in Australia in the record dating to 1900, millions of acres of bushfires burned for weeks in the Northern Territory during September and October. From mid-August to early September, the largest wildfire since the start of the record in 2000 for the European Union burned in the Alexandroupolis municipality of Greece. The fire burned almost 232,000 acres. Overall, the total area burned in Greece in 2023 was more than four times its long-term average. This map shows global drought status in 2023 based on a scale called the Palmer Self-calibrating Drought Index. Areas experiencing the most extreme drought are darkest brown; places that were extremely wet over the year are colored dark blue green. Nearly 8 percent of the global land area experienced extreme drought in 2023—a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, adapted from , Plate 2.1(s). The Arctic had its fourth-warmest year in the 124-year record, with summer (July to September) record warm. Below-ground, permafrost temperatures were the highest on record at over half of the reporting sites across the Arctic. Permafrost thaw disrupts Arctic communities and infrastructure and can also affect the rate of greenhouse gas release to the atmosphere, potentially accelerating global warming. The seasonal Arctic minimum sea-ice extent, typically reached in September, was the fifth-smallest in the 45-year record. The amount of multiyear ice—ice that survives at least one summer melt season in the Arctic—continued to decline. Since 2012, the Arctic has been nearly devoid of ice that is more than four years old. Very little ice older than 4 years (white) remains in the Arctic today. The year-round ice pack is younger, thinner, and more vulnerable to melting during the summer. NOAA Climate.gov image from our based on data from National Snow and Ice Data Center. Both the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage became accessible to non-ice-hardened marine traffic. The Northern Sea Route, connecting the European Arctic to the Pacific Ocean via the north coast of Russia and Bering Strait, saw 75 ship transits in the 2023 open season, the second-highest number of ships on record. The Northwest Passage, which connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific via northern Canada and Alaska waters, saw a record number of ship passages. A total of 42 ships made the complete Northwest Passage transit, far surpassing the previous record of 33 ships in 2017. Eight months saw new monthly mean record lows in sea ice extent and sea ice area, and 278 days in 2023 set new daily . On February 21, Antarctic sea ice extent and sea ice area both reached all-time record lows, surpassing the previous record lows that were set just a year earlier in February 2022. On July 6, a new record-low daily sea ice extent was 695,000 square miles (1.8 million square kilometers) lower than the previous record low for that day. Daily ice extent around Antarctic in 2023 to date (dark red) compared to all years from 1979–2012 (light gray), years from 2013–2015 (blue), and years from 2016–2022 (light red). The annual winter maximum ice extent around Antarctica has been highly variable in the past decade, with some years above average and others below average. The 2023 record low, however, is far outside the range of previous natural variability. Animation by National Snow and Ice Data Center. There were 82 named tropical storms during the Northern and Southern Hemisphere storm seasons last year, which was below the 1991–2020 average of 87. Seven tropical cyclones reached Category 5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Globally, the accumulated cyclone energy—a combined measure of the strength, frequency, and duration of tropical storms and hurricanes—rebounded from the lowest in the 43-year record in 2022 to above average in 2023. Typhoon Doksuri (named Egay in the Philippines) caused $18.4 billion U.S. dollars in economic losses in the northern Philippines and China. Beijing received 744.8 mm of rain from remnants of the storm in a 40-hour period, which was the city’s heaviest rainfall in its 140-year record and caused floods that killed 137 residents. , developing into a tropical cyclone on February 6 and finally dissipating on March 12. Freddy crossed the full width of the Indian Ocean and made three landfalls in total: one in Madagascar and two in Mozambique. In the Mediterranean—outside of traditional tropical cyclone basins—heavy rains and flooding from Storm Daniel killed more than 4,300 people and left more than 8,000 missing in Libya.

        "content": "Reconstruction of total solar irradiance based on sunspot observations since the 1600s. During strong solar cycles, the Sun's total average brightness varies by up to 1 Watt per square meter. Changes in the Sun's overall brightness since the pre-industrial period have been minimal, making a very small contribution to global-scale warming. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on the Climate Data Record by Coddington, et al., 2016. The Sun’s energy output changes over multiple time scales. The most regular pattern is an 11-year cycle of high and low activity caused by reversal of the Sun’s magnetic poles. During strong cycles, the Sun’s total brightness at solar maximum is about 0.1 percent higher than it is at solar minimum. Intensitygrams—images of the Sun in filtered visible light—based on data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory telescope on February 28, 2014, (left), near the maximum of the last solar cycle, and on February 18, 2020 (right), near the solar minimum. Dark patches called sunspots are easier to see than their companion faculae, diffuse bright areas that contribute to making the Sun slightly brighter during solar maximum. Images from Averaged over the complete solar cycle, there’s been minimal long-term change in the Sun’s overall brightness since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Records of sunspots show increased solar activity during the first 7 decades of the 20 century, likely tied to the peak of the last 100-year Cycle. Following that peak around 1960, solar activity declined. In fact, activity during the most recent solar cycle is among the lowest in a century. Meanwhile, the rate of global warming has accelerated over the past few decades. A comprehensive review of published scientific research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that, averaged over the solar cycle, the best estimate of the Sun’s brightness change between the pre-industrial period and the present (2019) is 0.06 Watts per square meter. That increase could be responsible for about 0.01 degrees Celsius—around 1 percent—of the warming the planet has experienced over the industrial era (0.95–1.2 degrees Celsius in 2011–2020 versus 1850–1900). Yearly total solar irradiance (orange line) from 1610–2020 and the annual global temperature compared to the 20th-century average (red line) from 1880–2020. Since the middle of the 20 -century, solar activity has declined while global temperature increased rapidly. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on solar from Coddington et al., 2016, and temperature from NOAA NCEI. Even if the Sun’s recent quietness—the 11-year cycle minimum in 2011 was the lowest in a century—were to turn into a multi-decade stretch of extremely low activity known as a Grand Solar Minimum, it wouldn’t overpower the amount of global warming projected for the coming century due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, as long as atmospheric carbon dioxide remains above 300 parts per million, not even , which theory predicts would begin 50,000 years from now, is likely to occur. The Sun’s brightness changes on multiple time scales, from seconds to centuries to millennia, and these changes can influence climate. The cycle that matters most on human timescales is the 11-year sunspot cycle, which is linked to the reversal of the poles of the Sun’s . The magnetic fields are generated by a below the Sun’s surface. Astronomers have tracked sunspot cycles since the 1600s by counting sunspots, giant dark splotches that emerge and drift across the surface of the Sun over the span of days or weeks. Digital scans of drawings by Galileo, showing sunspots he observed through a telescope on July 4 (left) and 5 (right), 1613. Images courtesy the Sunspots are regions on the Sun where the magnetic field is so strong that it blocks convective heat flow to the visible surface. As a result, sunspots are cooler than the surrounding “face” of the Sun. On their own, they make the Sun dimmer by reducing the Sun’s net radiative output. Indeed, some early astronomers and Earth scientists hypothesized that the Sun’s energy output would be when . But as observing techniques improved, astronomers realized that sunspots were not the only solar feature that altered the Sun’s energy output. Dark spots are usually accompanied by bright magnetic features called . These bright regions are more spread out and have lower contrast than sunspots, which means they are harder to see on the Sun’s visible surface, except when they are near the edges of the solar disk. As the Sun rotates and sunspots approach the edge of the solar disk, diffuse, bright areas called faculae become visible. Despite dimming caused by sunspots, faculae and other bright features make the Sun a little brighter overall at solar maximum than it is at solar minimum. These images were captured by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory between April 15 and 23, 2014—near the peak of the last solar cycle. Overlying the visible-light are bright regions called that are clearly evident when the Sun is viewed . A dense network of dispersed, bright features weaves across most of the Sun’s surface during periods of high activity. Since the late 1970s, satellites have been documenting the solar cycle directly by measuring the total incoming sunlight received at the top of Earth’s atmosphere and by collecting images of the Sun in a range of wavelengths of light. These observations revealed that as the solar cycle builds, increased brightness from features like and plage exceeds the dimming in sunspots, making the Sun slightly brighter at solar cycle maxima than it is at solar minima. Daily observations of total solar irradiance (orange line) since the start of the satellite era in 1978. Day-to-day, TSI may vary by as much as 0.3 percent, but average differences between maximum and minimum are on the order 0.1 percent, or around 1 Watt per square meter. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on from LASP Interactive Solar Irradiance Data Center. Satellite observations through several solar cycles reveal that the difference in total average brightness between solar maxima and minima is very small, on the order of 1 Watt per square meter during strong cycles. On average, the Sun delivers 1,361 Watts of power per square meter at a distance of one . This amount is known as the Based on observations and models, experts estimate that the impact of this 11-year variation on global surface temperature is likely around 0.1 degrees Celsius or less. Scientists today have close to four decades of overlapping measurements of total solar irradiance and sunspots, which allow them to statistically describe how changes in sunspot numbers relate to variations in total solar irradiance. They’ve used that relationship to model the Sun’s brightness back to the start of the sunspot record in the 1600s. Total solar irradiance estimated from sunspot observations since 1610. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on the NOAA TSI Climate Data Record (Coddington et al., 2016). These historical reconstructions reveal that some solar cycles are more active than others, and that their timing isn’t completely random. Generally, 2-3 relatively strong cycles will be preceded and followed by 2-3 relatively weak ones. These alternating strong and weak epochs tend to be grouped together over approximately 100-year periods, a pattern known as cycles. Over the span of the historical sunspot record, there have been three ~100-year cycles: 1700-1810, 1810-1910, and 1910-2010. The amplitude of the 11-year solar cycle (formally called the Schwabe cycle, orange) is modulated by the approximately 100-year Gleissberg cycle (charcoal), in which a number of consecutive cycles of high activity are bracketed by consecutive cycles of lower activity. The start of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s coincided with a Gleissberg maximum. The relatively high activity of the mid 20th-century also coincided with a Gleissberg maximum, while the recent decades coincide with a Gleissberg minimum. NOAA Climate.gov image based on data from Wang and Lean, 2021. In addition, the record shows that there have been periods when sunspots virtually disappear for several decades. (Other features of the 11-year solar cycle continue to occur, however.) These periods are called Grand Solar Minimums. For example, between 1645-1715, the Sun went through a 70-year quiet period known as the Maunder Minimum. Sunspots disappeared almost completely, and the solar wind was maybe . The Maunder Minimum partially overlapped a centuries-long cold spell called the Little Ice Age, which was strongest in the Northern Hemisphere between 1450­-1850. A 2000-year temperature history of the Northern Hemisphere outside the tropics shows a warm period that peaked around 1,000 A.D. followed by a multi-century period of cooling: the Little Ice Age. The coldest part of the Little Ice Age overlapped the very low solar activity of the Maunder Minimum, but the cold spell began well before. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on from Christiansen and Ljungqvist, 2012. In contrast, the Sun was unusually active in the twentieth century, a period which solar experts call the Modern Maximum. Starting near the turn of the twentieth century, each solar cycle was increasingly active. This build up was tied to the last Cycle, which peaked during solar cycle 19 in 1957. Solar activity then declined in the second half of the 20 -century. The stretch of high activity drew to a definite close in the first decade of the twenty-first century with solar cycle 23, which had an unusually long and low minimum. Solar cycle 24 went on to have one of the lowest maximums of the last 70 years, and solar cycle 25 is expected to be comparable. Meanwhile, Earth's surface temperatures continued to rise rapidly. Taken together, the increasing solar activity of the first half of the 20th century and the decreasing activity since then have largely canceled each other out in terms of their influence on global temperature. In the Sixth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, experts concluded that the best estimate for the influence of the Sun on climate between the pre-industrial (1850-1900) and the present (2010-2019) was that it added 0.01 Watts per square meter to the global energy imbalance causing global warming. Such a small energy imbalance (scientists call it a ) is likely to be responsible for no more than 0.01 degrees Celsius of warming over that period. That’s 100 times smaller than the overall warming that’s occurred on Earth over the industrial period, which the estimates as 0.95–1.2 degrees Celsius in 2011–2020 versus 1850–1900. The modern sunspot record tells us about solar activity over the past four centuries. Indirect evidence for solar activity deeper in the past comes from the presence of —radioactive atoms that are generated when common isotopes of an element are struck by . Our solar system is constantly bombarded with galactic cosmic rays, but the Sun’s magnetic field shields us from most of them. When the Sun’s magnetic field is strong, at solar maximum, fewer cosmic rays reach the atmosphere, creating very few isotopes. At solar minimum, when the Sun’s magnetic field is weaker, slightly more cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere, generating more isotopes. The two most common isotopes are carbon-14, which can be found in tree rings, and beryllium-10, which is found in ice cores. Using fluctuations in isotopes, experts have reconstructed solar activity back thousands of years. A reconstruction of total solar irradiance over the past 9,400 years based on a combination of carbon-14 isotopes in tree rings and beryllium-10 in ice cores. The record indicates there have been at least 25 Grand Solar Minimums in the Holocene. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on from Steinhilber et al., 2012. These reconstructions reveal that the Sun has produced at least 25 grand minimums in the past 9,000 years. Some are short—just two or three decades—and others, like the Maunder Minimum, are five or more decades. They occur every 200 years or so, a period known as the de Vries cycle. Many of them were preceded by a solar cycle with an unusually long and low solar minimum, similar to the minimum of 2008. Naturally, climate experts began to wonder: if the Sun were on the verge of a new grand minimum, how would it affect global warming? In one published in 2013, scientists explored the impact on global warming if a grand solar minimum strong enough to reduce total solar irradiance by 0.25% (a total solar irradiance decrease of 3.4 Watts per square meter) were to begin in 2025 and last through 2065. If greenhouse gas emissions proceed along a lower path (RCP 4.5) in the coming decades, a Maunder-like minimum might reduce the amount of global warming expected by 2065 by around 20%. In a future with moderately high levels of greenhouse gases, large areas of the high northern latitudes could experience winter warming of at least 6 degrees Celsius (11 degrees Fahrenheit, left). A strong Grand Solar minimum could reduce but not eliminate this warming (right). NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from Spiegl and Langematz, 2020. Additional experiments have compared the impacts of grand solar minimums of different strengths with different emissions paths. For example, for a future in which greenhouse gases follow an intermediate pathway (RCP 6.0), that a relatively weak Grand Solar Minimum, during which total solar irradiance dropped by 1.3 Watts per square meters for 5 decades in the middle of this century, could reduce global warming by 10%. To reach a 20% reduction in global warming, the Grand Solar Minimum would have to be strong: sunlight at the top of the atmosphere would need to drop by nearly 6 Watts per square meter. A drop that large would significantly exceed what our current understanding of the Sun says is realistic. On the whole, these and find consistent results. While the Sun's influence is detectable in Earth's temperature records, the global-scale warming influence of human-produced greenhouse gases is likely to be far stronger than even a very strong Grand Solar Minimum The 11-year sunspot cycle and its modulation cause small changes in the Sun’s actual brightness—how much sunlight the Sun radiates to Earth. Earth’s climate is also affected by how much sunlight us due to changes in our planet’s orbit and position in space relative to the Sun. Called , these predictable orbital patterns have repeat times of tens to hundreds of thousands of years. For the past million years at least, cycles have coincided with 100,000-year-long ice ages punctuated by short intervals of rapid warming. Although there are pieces of the puzzle experts still don’t understand, the key climate influence seems to be changes in the amount of incoming sunlight, or , reaching the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during the summer. The Northern Hemisphere is key to the ice ages because massive ice sheets can only grow over land, not ocean, and most of Earth’s land area has been concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere for at least tens of millions of years. The most significant changes in Northern Hemisphere insolation come from three variations in Earth’s orbit: Because these cycles have different lengths, they overlap in complex rhythms, reinforcing one another at some times and offsetting one other at others. Northern Hemisphere summer insolation is maximized when tilt is extreme, eccentricity is extreme, and precession causes Northern Hemisphere summer solstice to occur near perihelion, the place in its orbit when Earth is closest to the Sun. Summer insolation is minimized when tilt is smaller, eccentricity is extreme, and Northern Hemisphere summer solstice occurs near aphelion, when Earth is farthest from the Sun. ( ) Milankovitch cycles over the past million years (tilt, precession, and eccentricity. ( ) Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. ( ) Global ice volume inferred from oxygen isotopes in sea floor sediments. Light gray column highlights conditions around 220,000 years ago, when overlap among the three orbital cycles brought a peak in Northern Hemisphere insolation, triggering a warming period with low ice sheet volume. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005. How low summer insolation must fall to trigger an ice age depends on how high atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are; the more carbon dioxide, the lower the insolation must be. Looking back the highest carbon dioxide level at the start of ice age was 300 ppm, and most were far lower. Scientists have used these past relationships to help build Earth system models that can predict how low the summertime insolation would need to fall to trigger the next ice age. One modeling experiment that Earth may have narrowly missed the initiation of a new ice age just before the start of the Industrial Revolution. Peak summer insolation was near an orbital minimum, and if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels had been 240 ppm instead of 280, ice sheets might have begun building up across parts of Alaska, Northern Canada, Iceland, and Scandinavia. Yellow lines show changes in incoming sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere due to Milankovitch cycles over the next 500,000 years. (l ) At pre-industrial levels carbon dioxide levels of around 280 parts per million (ppm), insolation must drop below about 455 watts/m (red line) to trigger an ice age, a threshold that will be reached around 50,000 years from now (blue snowflake). The higher the atmospheric carbon dioxide level, the lower the insolation has to fall to trigger an ice age, delaying the possibility for the next ice age by tens of thousands of years ( ) or more ( ). NOAA Climate.gov graphic, based on data from Archer and Ganopolski, 2005. that at pre-industrial carbon dioxide levels, summer insolation at 65° North need only dip 0.75 standard deviations below the mean—about 15 Watts per square meter—for summers to be too cool to melt all the winter snow, a low that Milankovitch cycles predict we will next hit about 50,000 years from now. At 400 parts per million, summer insolation would need to fall twice as much—a low we will next see 125,000 years from now. At carbon dioxide levels above 560 parts per million, the study predicted, no Milankovitch variation within the next half million years will be low enough to trigger an ice age.

        "content": "Spring (April–June) snow extent each year compared to the 1981–2010 average. Years with above-average snow cover are blue-green, while years with below-average snow cover are brown. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by Thomas Estilow. Records from the last five decades show that spring snow cover is disappearing earlier in the year than it did in the past. The area of snow-covered ground is declining most rapidly in June, a month when, historically, Siberia, Alaska, and northern Canada remained partially snow covered. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the total area covered by snow during March and April—the end of the snow season for much of the mid-latitudes—has also shrunk over time. Map of April–June snow cover trends across the Northern Hemisphere from 1972–2024 based on satellite observations of the number of days each location had snow on the ground each year. Places where snow-covered days declined by up to three days per decade are shown in brown; places where snow-covered days increased by up to 3 days per decade are blue-green. (Only places that had snow in at least 25% of the years on record are included in the analysis). Most of the Northern Hemisphere has experienced declines in the number of snow-covered spring days over the past 5 decades. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data and analysis by . Natural patterns of climate variability such as the and the can affect the total amount of snow that falls each year. In different phases of these climate patterns, some regions receive abnormally large or small amounts of snow. Despite this yearly variability, the long-term trend in the Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover is negative. Between 1967 and 2022, April snow cover declined by 1.32 percent per decade, May snow cover by 4.1 percent per decade, and June snow cover by 12.95 percent per decade. (Explore trends in monthly snow cover using the at NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.) Looking at just the Arctic, snow cover extent, duration, depth, and water stored by the snowpack are all declining. Overall, snow is declining in both the Eurasian Arctic and the North American Arctic, although just how below average the snow extent is varies from month to month and region to region as a result of natural variability. For example, according to NOAA's , 2021 spring snow cover extent in the Eurasian Arctic was well below average in May (5 lowest on record) and June (3rd lowest). In the North American side of the Arctic, however, snow deficits were smaller, ranking 14 lowest in May and 16 lowest in June. In fact, spring snow cover in the Arctic is disappearing even faster than summer sea ice. Beginning in the 1960s, weekly maps of snow extent in the Northern Hemisphere have been made from satellite imagery. Now, satellites provide daily maps of snow cover for both hemispheres. Ground observations, precipitation gauges, and weather stations with pressure-sensitive “pillows” measure the amount of snow on the ground and validate the satellite maps. About one-third of Earth’s land surface is covered by snow for some part of the year. The bright white covering affects global conditions by reflecting solar energy away from surfaces that would otherwise absorb it. Therefore, the earlier decrease in snow cover increases the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth, and in turn, surface temperatures. In step with earlier dates of spring budburst for many plant species, reduced spring snow cover is a sign that winter conditions are lasting for a shorter period while growing seasons are getting longer.

Lack of snow leaves them exposed to the elements and to predators. NPS by Tim Rains. At regional and local scales, water resource managers, flood forecasters, and farmers are intensely interested in knowing how much water is in snow and when it will melt. Locally, snow provides moisture to soil and plants. On a larger scale, runoff from melting snow feeds streams and rivers that supply water for agriculture and cities. Knowing when and how quickly snow will turn to water is essential for forecasting if water from snowmelt will soak into the ground or cause flooding. In managed watersheds, earlier melting of snow can change when and how much water is available for various uses. Mudryk, A. Elias Chereque, R. Brown, C. Derksen, K. Luojus, and B. Decharme.

        "meta_description": "The highest odds for a much warmer than normal September are in the central West and southern Florida. The highest odds for a much drier than normal September are in the Upper Midwest.",
        "content": "After a very hot early and middle part of summer, August provided a welcome relief across much of the nation, with much-above-normal temperatures largely confined to the Deep South. The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer. Summer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August. As we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here’s the outlook from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September. The U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean , not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September. or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. On August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest. The precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean , not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September. or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. In addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I’ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here’s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found . The updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC’s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks. The September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. ( means “in the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.”) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions. The best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is “equal chances” along the coast. It’s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so “equal chances” is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month. The precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-“equal chances” forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough. Below-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods. The amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing and drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards. The summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project. Regionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north. U.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See for Alaska and Hawaii. With above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.

        "content": "Rising amounts of greenhouse gases are preventing heat radiated from Earth’s surface from escaping into space as freely as it used to. Most of the excess atmospheric heat is passed back to the ocean. As a result, upper ocean heat content has increased significantly over the past few decades. Upper layers are accumulating heat faster than deeper layers, but averaged over the full depth of the ocean, the 1993–2022 heat-gain rates are approximately 0.64 to 0.83 Watts per square meter averaged over the surface of the Earth. Seasonal (3-month) heat energy in the top half-mile of the ocean compared to the 1955-2006 average. Heat content in the global ocean has been consistently above-average (red bars) since the mid-1990s. More than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the Earth system due to human-caused global warming has been absorbed by the oceans. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on from the product collection. Change in heat content in the upper 2,300 feet (700 meters) of the ocean from 1993-2022. Between 1993–2022, heat content rose by up to 6 Watts per square meter in parts of the ocean (dark orange). Some areas lost heat (blue), but overall, the ocean gained more heat than it lost. The changes in areas covered with the gray shading were small relative to the range of natural variability. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NCEI. The ocean is the largest solar energy collector on Earth. Not only does water cover more than 70 percent of our planet’s surface, it can also absorb large amounts of heat without a large increase in temperature. This tremendous ability to store and release heat over long periods of time gives the ocean a central role in stabilizing Earth’s climate system. The main source of ocean heat is sunlight. Additionally, clouds, water vapor, and greenhouse gases emit heat that they have absorbed, and some of that heat energy enters the ocean. Waves, tides, and currents constantly mix the ocean, moving heat from warmer to cooler latitudes and to deeper levels. Heat absorbed by the ocean is moved from one place to another, but it doesn’t disappear. The heat energy eventually re-enters the rest of the Earth system by melting ice shelves, evaporating water, or directly reheating the atmosphere. Thus, heat energy in the ocean can warm the planet for decades after it was absorbed. If the ocean absorbs more heat than it releases over a given time span, its heat content increases. Knowing how much heat energy the ocean absorbs and releases is essential for understanding and modeling global climate. Historically, taking the ocean’s temperature required ships to dangle sensors or sample collectors into the water. This time-consuming method could only provide temperatures for a small part of the planet’s vast ocean. To get global coverage, scientists turned to satellites that measure the height of the ocean’s surface. As water warms, it expands, so estimates for ocean temperature can be deduced from sea surface heights. To get a more complete picture of ocean heat content at different depths, scientists and engineers also use a range of temperature-sensing instruments. Among these are a fleet of more than 3,000 robotic “floats” that measure ocean temperature around the world. Known as Argo floats, the sensors drift through the ocean at different depths. Every 10 days or so, according to their programmed instructions, they rise through the water, recording temperature (and salinity) as they ascend. When a float reaches the surface, it sends its location and other information to scientists via satellite, and then descends again. Instruments for taking ocean temperatures include Conductivity-Temperature-Depth instruments (known as CTDs), Expendable Bathythermographs (known as XBTs), and Argo floats. Seals have even been fitted with instruments to obtain temperatures in areas that are difficult to reach. (Photos courtesy of NOAA, Kara Lavender, and M. Weise, California Sea Grant.) Scientists constantly compare data from satellites, floats, and probes to verify that the values they produce make sense. They process the range of measurements to calculate an estimate for global average ocean heat content every three months. Converting the temperatures to joules (a standard unit of energy) allows them to compare heat in the ocean to heat in other parts of Earth’s climate system. More than 90 percent of the warming that has happened on Earth over the past 50 years has occurred in the ocean. estimate that warming of the upper oceans accounts for about 63 percent of the total increase in the amount of stored heat in the climate system from 1971 to 2010, and warming from 700 meters down to the ocean floor adds about another 30 percent. Annual ocean heat content compared to the 1993 average from 1993-2019, based on multiple data sets: surface to depths of 700 meters (2,300 feet) in shades of red, orange, and yellow; from 700-2,000 meters (6,650 feet) in shades of green and blue; and below 6,650 feet (2,000 meters) as a gray wedge. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, adapted from Figure 3.6 in State of the Climate in 2019. See original figure for details about data sources and uncertainty. Averaged over Earth's surface, the 1993–2022 heat-gain rates were 0.38 (±0.05) to 0.44 (±0.10) Watts per square meter for depths from 0–700 meters (down to 0.4 miles), depending on which research group's analysis you consult. Meanwhile, heat gain rates were 0.17 (±0.03) to 0.32 (±0.04) Watts per square meter for depths of 700–2,000 meters (0.4–1.2 miles). For depths between 2000–6000 meters (1.2–3.7 miles), the estimated increase was 0.07 (±0.03) Watts per square meter for the period from September 1992 to January 2013. According to the report, “Summing the three layers (despite their slightly different time periods as given above), the full-depth ocean heat gain rate ranges from 0.64 W m to 0.83 W m applied to Earth’s entire surface.” Less than a watt per square meter might seem like a small change, but multiplied by the surface area of the ocean (more than 360 million square kilometers), that translates into an enormous global energy imbalance. It means that while the atmosphere has been spared from the full extent of global warming for now, heat already stored in the ocean will eventually be released. That release of ocean heat would commit Earth to at least some additional warming in the future once greenhouse gas emissions stop. (The latest Earth system model simulations, however, find that at present levels of warming, this release of heat may be mostly balanced by the natural carbon cycle, which will begin incrementally reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels right away. If these models are correct, the amount of warming that can be expected once greenhouse gas emissions reach zero is at most a few tenths of a degree Celsius over a decade, and may be closer to zero.) In the present, warming of ocean water is raising global sea level because water expands when it warms. Combined with water from melting glaciers on land, the rising sea threatens natural ecosystems and human structures near coastlines around the world. Warming ocean waters are also implicated in the thinning of ice shelves and sea ice, both of which have further consequences for Earth’s climate system. Finally, warming ocean waters threaten marine ecosystems and human livelihoods. For example, warm waters jeopardize the health of corals, and in turn, the communities of marine life that depend upon them for shelter and food. Ultimately, people who depend upon marine fisheries for food and jobs may face negative impacts from the warming ocean.

        "meta_description": "Present since the last ice age, most of the world's glaciers are now shrinking or disappearing altogether as the climate gets warmer.",
        "content": "Among the most dramatic evidence that Earth's climate is warming is the retreat and disappearance of mountain glaciers around the world. Based on preliminary data for 2022/23, 2023 was the 36 year in a row that the reference glaciers tracked by the lost rather than gained ice. Ice loss relative to 1970 for the glaciers in the World Glacier Monitoring Service's climate reference network. is the annual balance between how much snow accumulates on a glacier and how much ice is lost through melting, sublimation (evaporation), or iceberg calving. Including the preliminary values for 2022/23, these glaciers have lost more than 26 meters of which is roughly the same as slicing a 94-foot slab off the top of each glacier in the network. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from the Glaciers that exist today are mostly remnants of the last ice age. Thick sheets of ice advanced and retreated across most continents several times before withdrawing to the polar regions about 10,000 years ago. Continent-scale ice sheets still cover Greenland and Antarctica, while smaller ice caps and glaciers retreated to the world's high latitudes and mountains. Roughly 20,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum of the Pleistocene Ice Age, ice spread over much of North America and Eurasia. (High-resolution without annotations .) Image by Climate.gov based on data from the , provided by Originally, scientists began studying glaciers only for the clues they offered about Earth’s climate during past ice ages and the role they played in shaping the landscape. Today, they are also trying to understand how quickly human-caused climate change will cause them to disappear altogether. Glaciers gain mass through snowfall and lose mass through melting and sublimation (when water evaporates directly from solid ice). Glaciers that terminate in a lake or the ocean also lose mass through iceberg calving. Those that end in the ocean are called tidewater glaciers, and they have more complex cycles of advance and retreat than glaciers that terminate on land, at least on annual and decades-long time scales. Even in a stable climate, such glaciers can experience periods of rapid retreat that are more influenced by seafloor topography and ocean circulation at their terminus than recent climate conditions. Retreat of Muir Glacier between August 1941 and August 2004. Historically, Muir Glacier was an iceberg-calving, tidewater glacier. Its terminus was grounded in the waters of Muir Inlet, a narrow opening to Glacier Bay. In the six decades between the two photos, it has retreated so far that it's terminus is now inland. Photos from the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s of repeat photography of glaciers. To see if a glacier is growing or shrinking, glacier experts check the condition of snow and ice at several locations on the glacier at the end of the melt season. The scientists check snow levels against stakes they’ve inserted in the glacier, dig snow pits in the surface to examine the sequence of seasonal layers, and insert long poles into the glacier to probe characteristics of the snow and ice. Generally, the difference in thickness of snow from the previous measurement indicates the glacier’s —whether the glacier has grown or shrunk. Changes in the area and terminus of larger glaciers can also be tracked with satellite imagery. Scientists have described more than one hundred thousand glaciers in the World Glacier Inventory, but only a small fraction of these have been consistently monitored for long enough to measure climate-related changes in their size or mass. Scientists refer to this global collection of about 60 glaciers as \"climate reference\" glaciers. A given year's annual update will include 40 or so of the reference glaciers. (Not all glaciers are surveyed every year). Photos documenting the disintegration of Italy’s Careser Glacier between 1933 (top) and 2012 (bottom). After decades of negative mass balance, glaciers worldwide are shrinking, fragmenting, or disappearing. Photos courtesy of Luca Carturan, University of Padova According to the WGMS, the most recent hydrological years (2021/22 and 2022/23) have each brought ice losses well above the average of even the past full decade (2010-2019). Observed reference glaciers experienced an ice loss of 1.1 meters of water equivalent and 1.2 meters of water equivalent, respectively. That's roughly 4 feet of ice off each glacier in the network each year. \"With this,\" they report on their website, \"seven out of the ten most negative mass-balance years have been recorded after 2010.\" Tallying up each year's losses or gains through 2023, reference network glaciers have lost just over 26 feet of water equivalent relative to 1970—roughly the same as slicing an average of 28.6 meters (94 feet) off the top of each glacier. In , glacier expert Mauri Pelto reported that the pace of glacier loss in the WGMS reference network accelerated from -171 millimeters (6.7 inches) per year in the 1980s, to -460 millimeters (11 inches) per year in the 1990s, to -500 millimeters (1.6 feet) per year in the 2000s, to -889 millimeters (2.9 feet) per year for the 2010s. In many parts of the world—including the western United States, South America, China, and India—glaciers are frozen reservoirs that provide a reliable water supply each summer to hundreds of millions of people and the natural ecosystems on which they depend. Their accelerating retreat poses major challenges for people and nature. Pelto, M., WGMS Network. (2020). Alpine glaciers [in ]. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 101(8), S37–S38. .

        "meta_description": "A worldwide network of Argo floats gives scientists an unprecedented understanding of the ocean depths. Argo floats descend and ascend through the top 2,000 meters of the ocean, collecting observations as they move.",
        "content": "A Argo adrift in the icy waters of Antarctica's Weddell Sea in 2009. Photo provided by Olaf Boebel. There is a saying in climate science, “as the ocean goes, so goes the climate.” This phrase captures the notion that the ocean is, by far, the most powerful component and driver of the earth’s climate system. Yet the happenings in the ocean, especially below the surface, have been largely unknown for much of human history. Until the first deployment of Argo floats in 2000, less than 1 percent of the ocean below the upper few hundred meters was being monitored routinely. For a planet where oceans cover about 71 percent of the surface, that’s a lot of terra (or aqua) incognita. Enter the Argo float, which many consider the greatest leap in the climate observing system since the advent of satellites 50 years ago. An Argo float is an autonomous floating robot that alternately dives and ascends through the top 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) of the ocean, collecting climate observations as it goes. In 2007, the Argo program—an international collaboration involving more than 30 nations--achieved “full coverage,” defined as one float in every 3° x 3° square of ocean from 60°N and 60°S (outside of marginal seas).* The current generation of floats are capable of operating under ice and in marginal seas. Currently more than of these smart buoys roam the global ocean. As of September 2014, a total of 3,579 floats patrolled the ocean. Most of the fleet drifts at depths from 750-1250 meters (0.46-0.78 miles) in order to avoid seamounts, but they profile down to depths of about 2,000 meters. Image adapted from . Argo floats have been “one of the biggest steps forward in understanding climate-scale changes in the ocean,” says Rick Lumpkin, an oceanographer with NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. “[The floats] provide a much more detailed view of seasonal to interannual [year-to-year] fluctuations of upper ocean heat and salt than we had before.” Argo floats do not care about weather, operating year-round in storm-tossed seas. They also provide observations in regions such as the southern hemisphere that are rarely visited by research vessels. Argo data has become pivotal to research into ocean heat storage, sea level rise, natural ocean variability, and many more topics. Nearly 300 papers utilizing Argo data were published in 2013. Steve Piotrowicz, director of the Argo program since 2000, commented that “anyone studying oceanography in grad school in the ‘70s, including myself, couldn’t have envisioned anything like this in terms of how we are now able to observe the ocean and the expansion of knowledge and scientific research going on,” he says. Jason and the Argonauts remained a popular subject during the Renaissance when Biagio d'Antonio painted this narrative canvas. Image courtesy . In Greek mythology, a ship named the Argo was used to transport Jason and the Argonauts in search of a golden fleece. The name Argo was chosen for the fleet of aquatic robots because they were the to the satellite, which monitors the ocean’s topography from 830 miles above the Earth’s surface. The quest of the modern-day Argo and Jason is to provide a comprehensive view of the ocean. There are more than two dozen of the Argo floats but on average, the floats are about 5 feet long and weigh about 72 pounds. The main aluminum body is about 3.5 feet long and 8 inches in diameter, which is about the length of a baseball bat with a diameter about three times wider. The floats are powered by regular alkaline or lithium batteries that provide enough energy for the floats to complete, on average, over roughly four years. A simple exterior hides the complex interior of an Argo float. Image courtesy . The floats are deployed into the ocean by ships or aircraft, where they immediately begin to sink at a rate of about 4 inches per second. The ability of the floats to move vertically is controlled by its hydraulic system, which controls buoyancy by adjusting the amount of oil in an external bladder. While descending, the float withdraws oil from the bladder into the instrument, increasing the density of the float and allowing it to sink lower and lower into the water. After about a six-hour descent, the floats drift along with the currents at a depth of 1000 meters (3280 feet) for ten* days. On day ten, the float then descends to a depth of 2000 meters (6560 feet). Its trip is much shorter, though. After reaching this depth, the external bladder is inflated with oil, causing the float to rise to the surface. Along the way, the instrument records a vertical profile of the ocean by taking measurements of temperature and salinity at different depths as it ascends. Each float is capable of capturing a time series of data containing as many as 1,000 data points for each oceanic parameter measured. This is equivalent to taking measurements every 6.5 feet. A typical float cycle includes descents to 1,000 then 2,000 meters before surfacing. Image adapted from NOAA's . After returning to the surface, Argo floats transmit the data of their 10-day journey to the next available satellite using the or communication system. The floats spend sufficient time at the surface to ensure error-free data transmission before diving to start the process all over again. As the quest for knowledge of the ocean increases, scientists are deploying new for Argo floats to measure the oxygen content, ocean acidity, biogeochemical properties such as nitrates and chlorophyll and rainfall in the ocean. Other sensors under development are sensors measuring CO and how far light penetrates the water column. In addition, a growing number of floats are equipped with the Iridium two-way communication system. This will reduce the time spent at the surface to as little as 30 minutes--avoiding the risk of getting caught in fishing nets and other obstacles at the surface--and accommodate greater data transmission. Scientists are particularly interested in using Argo observations to account for all the excess heat that has built up in the Earth’s climate system due to a build-up of greenhouse gases. Argo data has revealed that much of the heat is stored in the upper layers of the ocean, but not all of it. Researchers suspect that the rest is being stashed in the deep ocean. Unfortunately, the current generation of Argo floats can only dive to a depth of 2,000 meters; any deeper and -they would implode due to the extreme pressure in the deep ocean. But this past summer, for the first time, two next-generation Argo floats began their first trip to the bottom of the sea... Help us improve our content"

This was 0.01°C (0.02°F) above the previous August record set last year, and the 15th consecutive month of record-high global temperatures. August 2024 marked the 46th consecutive August (since 1979) with temperatures at least nominally above the 20th-century average. There have been 15 consecutive months of record-hot global temperatures, spanning from June 2023 through August 2024. This breaks the previous record (May 2015 through May 2016) for longest record-warm global temperature streak in modern record (since 1980). Each month of record global temperatures, compared to the 1991-2020 average, is shown in sequence. Places that were warmer than average are red; places that were cooler than average are blue. Image by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. It was the second warmest August for global ocean surface temperatures. These temperatures occurred under ENSO-neutral conditions. According to , and should persist through January-March 2025. The Northern Hemisphere had its second-warmest August on record at 1.48°C (2.66°F) above average. The Northern Hemisphere land temperature also was second-warmest for August as was the ocean temperature. These were all slightly cooler than the record warm Northern Hemisphere in August 2023. The Arctic region had its fourth-warmest August on record. August 2024 in the Southern Hemisphere ranked warmest on record at 1.06°C (1.91°F) above average. The ocean-only temperature for August in the Southern Hemisphere ranked second-highest on record, while the land-only Southern Hemisphere temperature was warmest on record. Meanwhile, the Antarctic region had its second-warmest August on record, 1.85°C (3.33°F) above average, and was second lowest on record for August. The June 2024–August 2024 global surface temperature was the warmest June–August period in the 175-year record, 1.24°C (2.23°F) above the 20th-century average of 15.6°C (60.1°F). The past eleven June–August seasons have been the warmest such periods on record. showing global temperature each June-August from 1850-2024 compared to the 20th-century average. Warmer-than-average years are red; cooler-than-average years are blue. Image by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, created with . The June–August period is defined as the Northern Hemisphere's meteorological summer and the Southern Hemisphere's meteorological winter. The Northern Hemisphere summer 2024 temperature was the warmest on record, and marks the 46th consecutive summer with global temperatures nominally above the 20th-century average in the Northern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere winter temperature also ranked warmest on record, and marks the 54th consecutive winter that was at least nominally warmer-than-average in the Southern Hemisphere. Over the land surface, were record warm across much of Africa, eastern Europe, southwest Asia, central and southeast Asia, parts of southern Australia, and large parts of Brazil. Record warm June–August temperatures also occurred in many parts of the Arctic and Antarctic. Elsewhere seasonal temperatures were much above average across much of North America, except most notably in the central U.S. and western Alaska. Temperatures also were much above average or record warm in most of Greenland and northern parts of Scandinavia. In contrast to the widespread anomalous warmth and record-warm temperatures, areas with were generally confined to the southern third of South America, a small part of eastern Antarctica, and eastern parts of the Russian Far East and western Alaska. Sea surface temperatures for the June–August period were record warm across large parts of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean, the central and northern Indian Ocean, many parts of the western Pacific, and parts of the Southern Ocean. Areas with seasonal sea surface temperatures cooler than the 1991–2020 average included the southeastern Pacific Ocean, parts of the southern Atlantic, the North Atlantic, and a small part of the southwest Indian Ocean.

Gray areas represent missing data. Image by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. August was drier-than-average across much of Europe, the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa. Other areas with below-average precipitation included large parts of the U.S., Mexico, much of Argentina and large parts of the eastern half of Russia, central and southern China, and much of southern and central Australia. Areas most notably wetter than average included areas affected by , such as the southeastern U.S., parts of northwest India and southeast Pakistan, and parts of Japan. Other notable areas of above-average precipitation included southern areas of the West Africa Sahel, northeastern China and eastern Mongolia, central Asia, southern Bangladesh, parts of central Argentina, and much of central and western Alaska.

Places that received more precipitation than average are colored blue; places that received less precipitation than average are colored brown. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (University of Maryland). August 2024 was again a very hot month in terms of mean global surface temperature, with this June-August period setting a global heat record. The global precipitation average also remained slightly above the August average, and as the El Niño to La Niña transition slowly continued, the tropical rainfall anomaly [difference from the long-term average] pattern began to resemble a more . The mean precipitation analysis for August has the Asian monsoon with its usual swath of heavy rain across South Asia and also very intense Atlantic and Pacific , along with the subtropical dry zones. The anomaly map [shown above] for the month has intense positive anomalies over parts of the Indian sub-continent and surrounding waters and eastward through Southeast Asia and Indonesia and out into the Pacific. To the north of that feature and roughly parallel to that feature, a dry zone is evident. The dry anomaly dominates in the mid-Pacific along the equator, although weakly. These features indicate a slightly larger La Niña effect on the precipitation patterns this month as one might expect with the [sea surface temperature] index ending up . Some of these positive anomalies were associated with flooding and landslide events in Bangladesh and northeast India (100 dead) and tropical cyclone activity alongside of Japan and even over Hawaii (Big Island), with 20” of rain (look closely in the anomaly map for the rainfall track). A little further east one can also see additional tropical cyclone tracks, with a negative anomaly to the south (somewhat La Niña-like), indicating the ITCZ in this area is located a little to the north than its usual position. On the other hand, the Atlantic ITCZ is located a little to the south of its normal position, and the eastern Atlantic was devoid of tropical systems in August. However, early in the month Hurricane Debby developed and provided copious rain for Cuba and along the East Coast of the U.S. for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina (up to 10”) and then over Pennsylvania and New York state (5”). South America is dominated by drier than normal areas for August, especially along the northern coast. North America is mostly covered by negative anomalies across the southern U.S. and northern Canada, with positive anomalies along the border between the two and along the aforementioned East Coast and Alaska. The rainfall regime over tropical Africa was active in August, with positive anomalies along its broad ITCZ and associated flooding in Nigeria and Sudan and even across the Red Sea in Yemen (100 dead). Western and southern Europe were drier than average, with wildfires in Greece, very close to Athens. Farther north positive anomalies were noted over central Eurasia. Help us improve our content"

In human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects. Human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects. A suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with typical particle size in the range of a few nanometers to several tens of micrometers. Aerosols have both natural and human-caused sources. Overall, they tend to produce cooling by scattering incoming radiation and by affecting cloud cover, although some aerosols can cause warming directly by absorbing radiation and indirectly through their interactions with clouds. The variety of life, including the number of plant and animal species, other life forms, genetic types, habitats, and biomes in an ecosystem. The series of processes by which carbon compounds flow among reservoirs in the environment, such as the incorporation of carbon dioxide into living tissue by photosynthesis and its return to the atmosphere through respiration, the decay of dead organisms, and the burning of fossil fuels. In the carbon cycle, carbon flow or output from one reservoir transfers carbon to other reservoir(s). A naturally occurring gas, as well as a by-product of burning fossil fuels from fossil carbon deposits, burning biomass, land-use changes, and industrial processes (e.g., cement production). CO is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas that affects Earth’s radiative balance. As the reference gas against which the radiative forcing of other greenhouse gases are measured, it has a global warming potential of 1. A set of techniques that aim to remove and/or sequester carbon dioxide (CO ) directly from the atmosphere by either increasing natural carbon sinks or using chemical engineering to remove the CO . Any process, activity, or mechanism that removes carbon from the atmosphere. A carbon sink may also refer to a physical location, defined area, or geological or biological element of Earth’s system (e.g., the ocean, a country, biomass) that stores acquired carbon from the atmosphere for a specified period of time. The large-scale movement of waters in the ocean basin. It is a key regulator of climate by storing and transporting heat, carbon, nutrients and freshwater all around the world. (NASA, 2020) Climate in a narrow sense, is usually defined as the average weather or, more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the average and variability of defining factors over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate, in a wider sense, is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. Changes in average weather conditions that persist over multiple decades or longer. Climate change encompasses both increases and decreases in temperature, as well as shifts in precipitation, changes in frequency and location of severe weather events, and changes to other features of the climate system. Within the United States, is the recognition of diverse values and past and ongoing harms, equitable distribution of benefits and risks, and the procedural inclusion of affected communities in decision-making processes. (Adapted from USGCRP, 2023: Ch. 20) An understanding of how the climate system works, how human actions influence the climate, and how the climate influences people and other parts of the Earth system. A climate-literate person: A numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions, and feedback processes and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components, a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions; the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented; or the level at which empirical parameterizations are involved. Climate models are applied as a research tool to study and simulate long-term climate projections (decadal or longer) and operationally used to create shorter climate predictions (seasonal, annual, interannual). The matter, energy, and processes involved in interactions among Earth’s atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and Earth-Sun interactions. (USGCRP, 2009) Deviations of climate variables from a given average state, including the occurrence of extremes, at all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be intrinsic, due to fluctuations of processes internal to the climate system (i.e., internal variability), or extrinsic, due to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (i.e., forced variability). The integration of different knowledge systems and methodologies to systematically understand phenomena, systems, and processes. Productive work for people in conditions of freedom, equity, security, and human dignity. (European Commission, 2022) (ILO, 2024) The differential treatment of an individual or group of people on the basis of, for example, their race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), age, marital and parental status, disability, sexual orientation, or genetic information. An exceptional period of water shortage for existing ecosystems and the human population (due to low rainfall, high temperature and/or wind) Earth functions as a system of interdependent parts. These parts include the physical, chemical, and biological processes that all interact to shape our planet and the organisms on it. Also known as climate anxiety, a chronic fear of environmental doom. A functional unit consisting of living organisms, their nonliving environment, and the interactions within and between them. The components included in a given ecosystem and its spatial boundaries depend on the purpose for which the ecosystem is defined. In some cases, ecosystem boundaries are relatively sharp, while in others they are diffuse, and they can change over time. Ecosystems are nested within other ecosystems, and their scale can range from very small to the entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems either contain people as key organisms, or they are influenced by the effects of human activities in their environment. The release of climate-altering gases and aerosols into the atmosphere from human and natural sources. Environmental actions, behaviors, laws, and policies that have not been fair, that have limited meaningful involvement in environmental decision-making, or have unjustly allocated the risks and benefits of environmental action across communities, most often based on race, color, national origin, income, and gender identity, among others. The principle of being fair and impartial and a basis for understanding how the impacts and responses to climate change, including costs and benefits, are distributed in and by society in more or less equal ways. Often aligned with ideas of equality, fairness, and justice and applied with respect to equity in the responsibility for, and distribution of, climate impacts and policies across society, generations, and gender, and in the sense of who participates and controls the processes of decision-making. A weather event that is rare at a particular place and time of year, including, for example, heatwaves, cold waves, heavy rains, periods of drought and flooding, and severe storms. Definitions of “rare” vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10% or 90% probability density function estimated from observations. By definition, the characteristics of what is called extreme weather may vary from place to place in an absolute sense. Temperatures that are much hotter and/or humid than average. Because some places are hotter than others, this depends on what is considered average for a particular location at that time of year. The overflowing of the normal confines of a stream or other water body or the accumulation of water over areas that are not normally submerged. A diagram of the links among species in an ecosystem – essentially who eats what. A food chain shows only the organisms that contribute to the diet of the top consumer. (USGS, 2003) Carbon-based fuels from fossil hydrocarbon deposits, including coal, oil, and natural gas. The increase in global surface temperature relative to a baseline reference period, averaging over a period sufficient to remove interannual variations (e.g., 20 or 30 years). A common choice for the baseline is 1850–1900 (the earliest period of reliable observations with sufficient geographic coverage), with more modern baselines used depending on the application. The process through which heat is trapped near the Earth's surface by substances known as greenhouse gases. (NASA, 2024) Gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of radiation emitted by Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, and ozone are the primary GHGs in Earth’s atmosphere. Other GHGs include sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons; several of these are also ozone-depleting (and are regulated under the Montreal Protocol). The potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems, and environmental resources. A period of abnormally hot weather, often defined with reference to a relative temperature threshold, lasting from two days to months. Heatwaves and warm spells have various and, in some cases, overlapping definitions. Occurs when sea level rise combines with local factors to push water levels above the normal high tide mark. Changes in prevailing winds, shifts in ocean currents, and strong tidal forces (which occur during full or new moons) can all cause high tide flooding, inundating streets and other infrastructure even on sunny days. An ice body originating on land that covers an area of continental size, generally defined as covering > 19,000 mi2 (>50,000 km2), and that has formed over thousands of years through accumulation and compaction of snow. The consequences of realized risks on natural and human systems, where risks result from the interactions of climate-related hazards (including extreme weather/climate events), exposure, and vulnerability. Impacts generally refer to effects on lives, livelihoods, health, and well-being; ecosystems and species; economic, social, and cultural assets; services (including ecosystem services); and infrastructure. Bodies of dynamic and experiential knowledges gained over time by Indigenous Peoples, often associated with a specific place. IK includes observations, oral and written knowledge, innovations, practices, rituals, and beliefs; some IK is considered sacred and secret to a group or individuals. IK is inherently heterogeneous due to the cultural and geographic contexts from which it is derived. Also known as Native Science, Traditional Knowledges, Traditional Ecological Knowledges, or Indigenous Ways of Knowing. The multicentury period from the onset of large-scale industrial activity around 1750 to the present day. The reference period c. 1850–1900 is used to approximate preindustrial global average surface temperature. An unfair or unjust difference in the distribution, allocation, management, or use of a resource, benefit, or burden between groups of people. Created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the objective of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is to provide governments at all levels with scientific information that they can use to develop climate policies. The IPCC provides regular assessments of the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for adaptation and mitigation. IPCC reports are also a key input into international climate change negotiations. (IPCC, 2024) A set of principles, processes and practices that aim to ensure that no people, workers, places, sectors, countries, or regions are left behind in the transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy. It stresses the need for targeted and proactive measures from governments, agencies, and authorities to ensure that any negative social, environmental, or economic impacts of economy-wide transitions are minimized, while benefits are maximized for those disproportionately affected. Key principles of just transitions include respect and dignity for vulnerable groups, fairness in energy access and use, social dialogue and democratic consultation with relevant stakeholders, the creation of decent jobs, social protection, and rights at work. Just transitions could include fairness in energy, land use, and climate planning and decision-making processes; economic diversification based on low-carbon investments; realistic training/retraining programs that lead to decent work; gender-specific policies that promote equitable outcomes; the fostering of international cooperation and coordinated multilateral actions; and the eradication of poverty. Lastly, just transitions may embody the redressing of past harms and perceived injustices. Occurs when actions are taken that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence. Community excluded from mainstream social, economic, educational, and/or cultural life. Examples of marginalized populations include, but are not limited to, groups excluded due to race, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, physical ability, language, and/or immigration status. Movement of a person or a group of persons either across an international border or within a nation. It is a population movement encompassing any kind of movement of people, whatever its length, composition, and causes; it includes migration of refugees, displaced persons, economic migrants, and persons moving for other purposes, including family reunification. Measures to reduce the amount and rate of future climate change by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases or removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The was established by Presidential initiative in 1989 and mandated by Congress in the Global Change Research Act (GCRA) of 1990. Its mandate is to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.” The GCRA mandates that USGCRP prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a quadrennial assessment, referred to as the National Climate Assessment (NCA). (USGCRP, 2023) Actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems for the purpose of climate change mitigation. (USAID, 2022) Actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. Condition in which anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions are balanced by anthropogenic CO removals over a specified period. The process by which the pH measurement of ocean water moves toward more acidic levels due to the absorption of carbon dioxide, which interacts with ocean water to form carbonic acid, thereby lowering the pH. Increased acidity reduces the ability of plankton and shelled animals to form and maintain carbonate-containing body parts such as shells. Population or geographic location in the United States that experiences disproportionate environmental and climatic harms and risks. This disproportionality can be a result of greater vulnerability to environmental hazards, lack of opportunity for public participation, or other factors. Increased vulnerability may be attributable to an accumulation of negative or lack of positive environmental, health, economic, or social conditions within these populations or places. The term describes situations where multiple factors, including both environmental and socioeconomic stressors, may act cumulatively to affect health and the environment and contribute to persistent environmental health disparities. An international climate agreement adopted in 2015, which entered into force in 2016, with the central goal of holding the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. Under this agreement, each party must, among other things, submit a “nationally determined contribution” (NDC)—that is, a greenhouse gas emissions target and/or mitigation policies and measures—every five years and regularly report on progress made in implementing and achieving its NDC. The agreement also addresses efforts to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and certain support for developing country Parties, such as financial support for mitigation and adaptation. Approaches to research and planning in which those most directly impacted by the outcomes become active participants in the process. (Adapted from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2023) Any form of energy that is replenished by natural processes at a rate that equals or exceeds its rate of use. The capacity of interconnected social, economic, and ecological systems to cope with a climate change event, trend, or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity, and structure. Climate resilience is a subset of resilience against climate-induced or climate-related impacts. Threats to life, health, and safety, the environment, economic well-being, and other things of value. Risks are evaluated in terms of how likely they are to occur (probability) and the damages that would result if they did happen (consequences). Increase to the height of sea level, both globally and locally (relative sea level change) due to a change in ocean volume as a result of a change in the mass of water in the ocean (e.g., due to melt of glaciers and ice sheets), changes in ocean volume as a result of changes in ocean water density (e.g., expansion under warmer conditions), changes in the shape of the ocean basins, and changes in Earth’s gravitational and rotational fields, as well as local subsidence or uplift of the land. Sea level change refers to sea level rise or sea level fall. The institutions, policies, programs, practices, values, and behaviors that shape drivers, risks, impacts, and understanding of climate change. (Adapted from USGCRP, 2023: Ch. 20) The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of the sea due to extreme meteorological conditions (low atmospheric pressure and/or strong winds). The storm surge is defined as being the excess above the level expected from the tidal variation alone at that time and place. Adaptation that changes the fundamental attributes of a social–ecological system, often involving persistent, novel, and significant changes to institutions, behaviors, values, and/or technology in anticipation of climate change and its impacts. The point at which a change in the climate triggers a significant environmental event, which may be permanent, such as widespread bleaching of corals or the melting of very large ice sheets. An expression of the degree to which a quantity or process is unknown. In statistics, a term used to describe the range of possible values around a best estimate, sometimes expressed in terms of probability or likelihood. Uncertainty about the future climate arises from the complexity of the climate system and the ability of models to represent it, as well as the inability to predict the decisions that society will make. There also is uncertainty about how climate change, in combination with other stressors, will affect people and natural systems. A community who, due to continuous systemic discrimination, under- or disinvestments, and limited access to efficient, healthy, and affordable services and infrastructure, experiences disproportionate environmental and climatic harms and risks and lack access to adequate resources to mitigate, respond to, and recover from impacts. Increased vulnerability may be attributable to harmful environmental, health, economic, or social conditions—or to a lack of support for positive conditions—within these populations or places. The term describes situations where disproportionate vulnerability is often due to discrimination based on geography; access to authority or representation in governance; or social identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, culture, economic status, or ability. A federal interagency research program established by Congress in the Global Change Research Act of 1990. Its mandate is to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.” ( , 2024) An international climate agreement adopted in 1992, which entered into force in 1994. The objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. An organism, such as an insect, that transmits disease-causing microorganisms such as viruses or bacteria. Vector-borne diseases include, for example, malaria, Lyme disease, Zika, and chikungunya. The degree to which physical, biological, and socioeconomic systems are susceptible to and unable to cope with adverse impacts of climate change. The state of the atmosphere, mainly with respect to its effects on life and human activities. As distinguished from climate, weather consists of short-term (minutes to days) variations in the atmosphere. Popularly, weather is thought of in terms of temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, visibility, and wind. A state of existence that fulfills various human needs, including material living conditions and quality of life, as well as the ability to pursue one’s goals, to thrive, and to feel satisfied with one’s life. A wildland fire originating from an unplanned ignition, such as lightning, volcanos, unauthorized and accidental human-caused fires, and prescribed fires that are declared wildfires."

        "meta_description": "Between September 2019 and August 2020, the rate of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet was much lower that the record set the previous 12-month period, but but still above the 2002–2020 average. Overall, Greenland continues to lose ice.",
        "content": "If the ice that blankets Greenland melted away completely, global sea level would surge by more than 24 feet (7 meters). Glaciologists suspect that, for several decades before 1990, the Greenland Ice Sheet was neither gaining nor losing significant ice. Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow-On satellites have enabled scientists to better follow the ice sheet’s health. The observations show steady decline. Adapted from the (ARC), this graph shows monthly changes in Greenland ice mass over April 2002–April 2020. The 2017–2018 segment without data results from the gap between the GRACE missions. The background is a NASA satellite image of a Greenland fjord. Between September 2018 and August 2019, the Greenland Ice Sheet set a record for ice loss (532 ± 58 billion metric tons). Between September 2019 and August 2020, the rate of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet was much lower (293 ± 66 billion metric tons), but still above the 2002–2020 average measured by GRACE. Average ice loss for Greenland over the full 18-year record was 268 ± 14 billion metric tons per year. Greenland ice loss in 2019 was enough to raise global ocean level by 0.06 inches (1.5 millimeters). That amount might seem small, but Twila Moon, lead author of the ARC Greenland Ice Sheet chapter explains that it is just one source of rising seas, supplemented by others, “and that's simply a single year of addition.” Cumulative sea level rise is already harming coastal infrastructure around the globe, and the impacts will worsen into the future. “Some places, for example, the U.S. Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard, will see more sea level rise than other places in the world.” Lower melt rates over September 2019–August 2020 resulted partly from unusual atmospheric circulation centered over Greenland. The circulation caused lower summer surface air temperatures relative to the previous year. Over the same period, ice sheet albedo—reflectivity of sunlight from the ice sheet surface—was above average over most of the ice sheet. When ice reflects more light, it melts less. Moon cautions that the more muted melt in 2020 doesn’t signal a return to normal conditions. She says, “The Greenland Ice Sheet has lost ice every year now since 1998. Any ice loss is not helpful for maintaining the ice sheet. Even small years of ice loss add up.” Moon, T.A., Tedesco, M., Box, J.E., Cappelen, J., Fausto, R.S., Fettweis, X., Korsgasard, N.J., Loomis, B., Mankoff, K.D., Mote, T., Reijmer, C.H., Smeets, C.J.P.P., van As, D., van de Wal, R.S.W.

During the positive phase, the jet stream stays farther north, and mid-latitude winters are milder than usual. During the negative phase, the jet stream dips into the mid-latitudes, creating cold-air outbreaks. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from The Arctic Oscillation (AO) refers to an atmospheric circulation pattern over the mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The most obvious reflection of the phase of this oscillation is the north-to-south location of the storm-steering, mid-latitude jet stream. Thus, the AO can have a strong influence on weather and climate in major population centers in North America, Europe, and Asia, especially during winter. Winter surface pressure across the Northern Hemisphere compared to the 1981-2010 average when the Arctic Oscillation (AO) was strongly negative (top, 2009-10) and when it was strongly positive (bottom, 1988-89). The negative AO favors a warm Arctic and cool conditions across the U.S. and Europe. The positive phase favors a cool Arctic and relatively warm conditions in the mid-latitudes. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from the Physical Sciences Lab. The AO's positive phase is characterized by lower-than-average air pressure over the Arctic paired with higher-than-average pressure over the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The jet stream is farther north than average under these conditions, and storms can be shifted northward of their usual paths. Thus, the mid-latitudes of North America, Europe, Siberia, and East Asia generally see fewer cold air outbreaks than usual during the positive phase of the AO. Conversely, AO's negative phase has higher-than-average air pressure over the Arctic region and lower-than-average pressure over the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The jet stream shifts toward the equator under these conditions, so the globe-encircling river of air is south of its average position. Consequently, locations in the mid-latitudes are more likely to experience outbreaks of frigid, polar air during winters when the AO is negative. In New England, for example, higher frequencies of coastal storms known as \"Nor'easters\" are linked to AO's negative phase. AO phases are analogous to the Southern Hemisphere's Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), a similar pattern of air pressure and jet stream anomalies in the Southern Hemisphere. Viewed from above either pole, these patterns show a characteristic ring-shape or \"annular\" pattern; thus, AO and AAO are also referred to as the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM), respectively. and values for the Arctic Oscillation Index are available from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.

Posts reflect the views of the bloggers or guest contributors themselves, not necessarily those of Climate.gov, NOAA, or NCEI. In climate monitoring, we often use the term “outcome” to describe the results of a season. For example, “For most of the United States, seasonal outcomes during spring 2012 included a record-warm March and a record-warm spring.” Outcomes in climate—like in life—are a combination of factors. And at certain times of year—like certain times in life—different factors emerge as relatively more important to an outcome. In climate, spring dampness is one of those factors that emerges as important for warm season outcomes, particularly for the interior of the continent. The Sun shines down on a flooded cornfield near Orrick, Missouri, on June 6, 2015. When the ground is wet from spring rains, the summer Sun has to evaporate the water before the ground really srtarts to heat up. Photo by Vincent Parsons, . Used under a . This week, we’ll go to examine how spring precipitation influences summer temperatures, and why this matters a little more in land-locked areas. Flyover Country, from one of your native sons, this blog’s for you. The punchline of this blog is pretty straightforward: for much of the interior United States, the precipitation you get in the late spring can make a difference in temperature outcomes for the summer. Here’s some background: in the summer, because the sun is high in the sky and days are long, the Earth’s surface (that’s where we live) absorbs a heck of a lot of energy. The amount of moisture in the soil can control how much of that incoming energy goes into raising the surface temperature (“sensible heat”) and how much goes into evaporating water (“latent heat”). As you might guess, and have probably experienced, drier soils mean more sensible heating and less latent heating, which means higher temperatures. This is the “dry oven” scenario - almost all of that incoming energy is devoted to making the temperature go up. With wet soils, temperatures stay lower as more energy is consumed by the process of evaporating water. This is the “steam bath” scenario—the temperature stays lower, but there’s more water vapor added to the air. Folks in the southern plains saw the “dry oven” scenario in spades in the spring and summer of 2011. During the spring, while the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers saw epic flooding, Texas and Oklahoma were dry— dry. Most of the region racked up more than half a foot of rainfall deficits during the April-June period, which is the wettest stretch of a normal year. Precipitation for April-June 2011 compared to the twentieth-century average. The Southern Plains and Gulf Coast were much drier than average (brown), while the Upper Mississippi and Ohio Valleys were wet (green). NOAA NCEI map by Deke Arndt. By the end of summer, the region was not only mired in drought, but it was colossally hot. Oklahoma and Texas ended up in a neck-and-neck race for the hottest summer for any state on record, passing up some legendary competition. In the meantime, the waterlogged Ohio Valley stood out as a near-normal exception within a larger field of warmer-than-normal conditions. Temperature for June-August 2011 compared to the twentieth-century average. The Southern Plains and Gulf Coast were much hotter than average (red). The spring wetness in the Ohio Valley probably helped keep the temperatures in the Ohio Valley closer to normal (white). NOAA NCEI map by Deke Arndt. So, I’ve identified a pattern, a relationship between spring precipitation and summer heat. Climate scientists call that sort of pattern a “signal” (as opposed to just weather and climate “noise.”) But if you’re wondering how widespread the signal is…the answer is not very. The map just below shows the strength of relationship between late-spring rainfall (June, to be precise), and summer temperature. This map shows the correlation between June rainfall and the June-August temperature over the span of the historical record (1895-2015). Places where June rainfall explained less than 5% of the year-to-year variability in summer temperatures are colored light purple. Darkest purple shows places where June precipitation accounted for 25% of more of the variability in summer temperature. Map by Deke Arndt. A few key points can be made: There’s also more of the darker shading (stronger connection) towards the interior of the continent. It’s not a perfect match, but in general, the oceans have a moderating effect on both temperature and precipitation. Away from the oceans, in the nation’s heartland—again, all things being equal (and, again, they’re usually not!)—local summer temperatures outcomes can take on the shape of recent rainfall history. The spring 2016 wetness in the nation’s heartland may be worth watching. If that pattern holds for the next couple of weeks, and if we get locked into a summer doldrums situation, temperatures in those areas may be a little lower than the neighboring regions. Indeed, the Climate Prediction Center noted soil moisture as one factor (of several) that led to a lower probability of a warm summer in the region relative to the Thanks for going"

        "content": "A blog about monitoring and forecasting El Niño, La Niña, and their regional and global impacts...but sometimes about other climate phenomena that influence seasonal climate. The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA ), with periodic guest contributors. Ideas and explanations found in these posts should be attributed to the ENSO blog team, and not to NOAA (the agency) itself. These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. Recent cold air outbreaks over the north-central and northwestern U.S., along with record cold on Veterans Day in parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, should have people excited about (or dreading) the upcoming winter. My colleagues and I at the Climate Prediction Center have just issued for the upcoming “meteorological winter,” that is, December through February. Right now, our official outlook covers only temperature and total precipitation, with the latter combining both liquid and frozen precipitation. However, what about the frozen stuff? What about snow? Because many people remember winters that were either exceptionally snowy or not snowy at all, we get a lot of questions about what the winter forecast portends for seasonal snowfall accumulation. In many parts of the country, snowfall also has major economic and societal ramifications, including water resource management and winter tourism, among others. Tackling this problem is not easy, though. Part of the issue boils down to the technical difficulties of snowfall measurements—a real as Deke Arndt (NCEI) puts it. The other issue is related to the difficulties with prediction. As many people in the Northeast corridor are aware, snowfall with any given storm system is a function of the dreaded rain-snow line that separates air masses that are below or above freezing. For any given storm system, the exact boundaries between rain and snow can be hard to predict even days in advance. Luckily, at CPC, we aren’t trying to predict specific events, but the climate instead. We take a step back and see how temperature and precipitation forecasts might play a role in determining snowfall accumulation. In regions that receive a large percentage of their cold-season precipitation in the form of snow, increased seasonal precipitation is intuitively related to increased snowfall accumulation. In more temperate areas that receive a relatively small percentage of frozen precipitation, temperature becomes important. Anomalously cold temperatures are, more or less, a necessary condition for snow in those areas. Therefore, a region with a relatively cold winter may find itself on the cold side of storm systems more often. In more mountainous areas, where temperature varies as a function of elevation, colder systems result in snow falling at lower altitudes and more total snowfall coverage over a given region. This is where the long-term warming trends, recently , become important over western North America. Drier and warmer climate signals will generally result in lower snow coverage. Because a was recently issued, we will take a look at how La Niña, in general, affects snowfall across North America. This analysis is part of a broader effort at CPC to better understand and potentially predict seasonal snowfall, made possible in part by a new snowfall dataset (1). In a nutshell, La Niña is associated with a Ocean. The retreat of the jet stream results in more blocking high pressure systems that allow colder air to spill into western and central Canada and parts of the northern contiguous U.S. At the same time, storm track activity across the southern tier of the U.S. is diminished under upper-level high pressure, which also favors . The storm track is in turn shifted northward across parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes (2). Based on climate analysis (3) from this new snow dataset, we see that La Niña favors increased snowfall over the Northwest and northern Rockies, as well as in the upper Midwest Great Lakes region. Reduced snowfall is observed over parts of the central-southern Plains, Southwest, and mid-Atlantic. Snowfall departure from average for all La Niña winters (1950-2009). Blue shading shows where snowfall is greater than average and brown shows where snowfall is less than average. Climate.gov figure based on analysis at CPC using . This La Niña footprint is pretty intuitive. Given the northward shift of the storm track, relatively cold and wet conditions are favored over the northern Rockies and northern Plains, resulting in the enhancement of snowfall. Warmer and drier winters are more likely during La Niña over more southern states, and this is exactly where seasonal snowfall tends to be reduced (4). The more vigorous storm track and slight tilt toward colder temperatures over the northern tier of U.S. during La Niña modestly increases the chance of a relatively snowy winter. We can break up the snow pattern further and look at the weakest and strongest La Niña events. Splitting La Niña events into strength reveals some interesting differences worth investigating further. In this preliminary analysis below, there is a suggestion that weaker events are snowier over the Northeast and northern and central Plains on average. Snowfall departure from average for weaker La Niña winters (1950-2009). Blue shading shows where snowfall is greater than average and brown shows where snowfall is less than average. Climate.gov figure based on analysis at CPC using . On the other hand, stronger La Niña events (see below) are snowier across the Northwest, northern Rockies, western Canada, and the Alaska panhandle. Also, there is a tendency toward below average snowfall over the mid-Atlantic, New England, and northern and central Plains, which is not seen during weak La Niña. Snowfall departure from average for stronger La Niña winters (1950-2009). Blue shading shows where snowfall is greater than average and brown shows where snowfall is less than average. Climate.gov figure based on analysis at CPC using . Overall, stronger La Niña events exert more influence on the winter climate pattern over western North America. Weaker events appear to be associated with more widespread above-average snow over the northern United States. Because a weak La Niña means that the forcing from the Pacific is weaker than normal, it may imply other mechanisms (e.g. Arctic Oscillation) may be at play and is worth further investigation. The predictability of seasonal snowfall may be somewhat similar to precipitation in that one or two big events can dramatically affect the seasonal average. Thus, in general, the expected prediction skill is likely to be lower than for temperature. However, because temperature also plays an important role in snowfall, some predictability is likely nonetheless. And like for seasonal temperature and precipitation, knowing the state of ENSO is a pretty reasonable place to start. (1) This new dataset is documented in “Creation and Validation of a Comprehensive 1° by 1° Daily Gridded North American Dataset for 1900-2009: Snowfall” in the . The dataset for this analysis goes up to 2009, so we are going to look at winters from 1950-51 to 2008-09. Total cold season snowfall accumulation from October through April is used here. (2) This is consistent with the temperature pattern: the storm track is enhanced where the temperature gradient is stronger than normal. (3) Here we are using composite analysis to show snowfall. In this case we take just the La Niña years between 1950-51 and 2008-09 and compute the mean. For the strength composites, we divide the 18 La Niña winters between 1951-2009 into weak or strong cases. The used to split them is -0.95°C during December-February (DJF) average. We need to be cautious drawing too many conclusions based on the large reduction in our sample size. Composites also emphasize variance: regions with more year-to-year variability will have higher amplitude composite signals. (4) The areas in the South that favor below-average snowfall during La Niña are most evident where the snowfall climatology is reasonably high. That is where the signal is most likely to come through the noise.

However, that doesn't mean that ENSO cannot be a factor. In fact, there is reported connection between La Nina and increases in wildfires in the southwestern U.S., including California. You can read more about that in this post: ; It would take a careful investigation to determine how much La Nina may have contributed to the current fires in California.

So you can take all La Nina winters over the US and then average them together to see what the average pattern is-- this is a composite. An \"anomaly\" is a departure from average. For example, when we make composites, we average together the *anomalies* in snowfall, rainfall, or temperature because we are interested in the question of whether it will be \"wetter than average\" or \"drier than average.\" Maps (or composites) of anomalies come in positive and negative values which indicate \"above\" or \"below average.\" Submitted by on Thu, 04/07/2022 - 08:39 In reply to by With an El Nino winter coming up, I am wondering if similar data and maps exist for El Nino winters (weak to very strong).

Ideas and explanations found in these posts should be attributed to the ENSO blog team, and not to NOAA (the agency) itself. These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. The tropical Pacific is still in neutral, but nature continues giving us signs that La Niña is on the way, and our remains. Forecasters estimate a that La Niña will emerge during September–November and expect it will persist through the Northern Hemisphere winter. A weak La Niña is the most likely scenario. While there are no plot twists since —frequent readers could be forgiven for fast-forwarding this month’s update—that 71% chance of La Niña developing this autumn is a small upward tick. Also, the slower-than-expected development of La Niña is a great example of how the short-term (subseasonal) and very long-term (climate change) complicate seasonal outlooks. I’ll run the numbers in a minute, after a word from our sponsor. ENSO forecasters get their information from two general areas: and current observed conditions in the ocean and atmosphere. Climate models are up first, today. (See footnote.) Line graph showing observed and predicted temperatures (black line) in the key ENSO-monitoring region of the tropical Pacific from early 2024 though spring 2025. The gray shading shows the range of temperatures predicted by individual models that are part of the North American Multi Model Ensemble (NMME, for short). Most of the shading appears below the dashed blue line by the fall, meaning most models predict that temperature in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific will be cooler than average by at least 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit)—the La Niña threshold. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data provided by Climate Prediction Center. The North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) is a collection of computer models that take information about current global conditions and apply physical equations to make predictions about upcoming weather and climate. For more about the NMME, check out and from our friends at Seasoned Chaos. This set of climate models has been predicting the development of La Niña since last winter, and continues to do so, although it’s taking a little longer than initially expected. This isn’t particularly surprising, since are often less accurate than predictions made at other times of the year. Overall, though, the models’ prediction of La Niña this upcoming winter has been consistent, including from to this month, providing continued confidence in the forecast despite the slowdown. Time to check in with a few of our favorite characters. Our primary metric for ENSO, the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean in the , was about 0.1 °C cooler than the long-term average (long-term = 1991–2020) in August, according to the . This is solidly neutral—the La Niña threshold is 0.5 °C cooler than average—and only a small drop from July. 2-year history of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for all strong El Niño events since 1950 (gray lines) and the recent (2023-24) event (purple line). Five of the eight gray lines dip below the dashed blue line (the La Niña threshold) in the winter following the El Niño. The 2023-24 event appears headed in the same direction. Graph by Emily Becker based on monthly Niño-3.4 index data using . The winds over the tropical Pacific play an important role in ENSO’s dramatic arc. When the near-surface winds in the tropics—the trade winds—are stronger, they cool the surface and keep warmer water piled up in the far western Pacific. They can also trigger an upwelling , an area of cooler-than-average water under the surface that moves from west to east. Throughout August, the trade winds were stronger than average across most of the tropical Pacific, helping to maintain the gradual surface cooling tendency and to bolster the amount of cooler water under the surface. This cooler subsurface water will provide a source to the surface over the next few months. Beneath the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean at the equator, a deep pool of cooler-than-average (blue) waters has been building up over the past couple of months (July 12–Sept. 5, 2024). This pool of relatively cool water is a key factor behind the prediction for La Niña later this fall and winter. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on analysis from Michelle L'Heureux, Climate Prediction Center. We started this La Niña Watch party back in . Looking back at that forecast, the probability of La Niña developing by June–August was about 55%, with about a 42% chance of ENSO-neutral during that period. These probabilities mean that La Niña’s development in June–August was favored, but there was still a good chance that neutral would linger. As it turned out, the June–August average sea surface temperature in the Niño-3.4 region, the “ ,” was 0.1 °C below average, in the neutral range. So why is La Niña behind schedule? Honestly, nature is wild and crazy and it amazes me that we can predict anything ever, especially many months in advance. In this case, though, there are a couple of complicating factors we can point to. The first is our old frenemy, short-term , or, essentially, unpredictable weather events that complicate seasonal or longer predictions. For example, just a few periods of weaker trade winds can delay surface cooling. Unfortunately, is an ongoing challenge, and currently we can only predict these trade wind fluctuations a week or so in advance. On the other side of the timeline, we have climate change. The are still way above average, and they are over the next several months. We don’t yet have a of how global warming may affect ENSO in general, or the development of La Niña this year in specific. That said, the most likely outcome is still that La Niña will be in place this winter, with slightly greater than 80% chance of La Niña in November–January, probably a weaker event (see strength probabilities ). Out of the three climate possibilities—La Niña, El Niño, and neutral—forecasts say that neutral conditions are the most likely for the August–October season (tall gray bar above the ASO label, slightly over 60 percent chance). By the September-November (SON) season, La Niña has the highest chance of occurring (blue bar, 71 percent chance). NOAA Climate Prediction Center image. A weak La Niña wouldn’t play as large a part in steering global atmospheric circulation patterns, meaning a lower chance of on winter conditions. However, even a weak La Niña can nudge the winter climate and would likely factor into CPC’s . Stay tuned here for recaps and predictions about your favorite program, ENSO! There are two kinds of prediction models, dynamical and statistical. The model information I discuss in this post is from dynamical models. Statistical models use historical observations and their relationships to predict how conditions might evolve. Statistical models do not use physical equations, but rather statistical formulations that produce forecasts based on a long history of past observations of sea surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, subsurface temperature, and others. Statistical models have been around longer than dynamical models, because the dynamical ones require high performance computers. but this came up from years ago. I looked up the PDO in December 1917, and the PDO was a negative 0.52. La Nina was in place in the Tropical Pacific. I read that was the coldest and Snowiest begin to Winter 1917 - 18 that was ever recorded in the CONUS. Interesting that in January 1918 the PDO was a positive 0.42. Apparently, low readings in the PDO plus La Nina was responsible for the very harsh Winter 1917 - 18. I also looked up the AMO (AMV) and from 1880, and has been slowly climbing from that year to now. The AMO in 1917 - 18 was strongly negative and now strongly positive and the PDO is a negative 2.88. Appreciate any thoughts on this scenario.

As we go into the Northern Hemisphere cool season, it will be interesting to see if these numbers remain separated. The RONI, which takes the entire tropical oceans into account, may be a useful metric to understand ENSO in a warming world. It is not the official NOAA metric for ENSO and is still in the testing stage. Submitted by on Fri, 09/20/2024 - 11:02 In reply to by Thanks Emily. What is out there that may influence La Nina's effects and make it a stronger event than what is measured by the SSTs in the Nino 3.4? Submitted by on Mon, 09/23/2024 - 12:21 In reply to by 1. As usual, this was an interesting and informative post 2. Your \"word from our sponsors\" part seemed a bit like one of those TV drug ads, where they introduce some medicine and talk about how wonderful it is, but then describe its side effects really quickly, in a manner that sounds kind of funny. (Use of xxx has been linked to such problems as finger cancer, growing a tail, and minor cases of death. See your doctor for details.) So, you could almost have done something like that for this: (spoken quickly) \"Following the ENSO blog regularly has been found to result in users understanding this atmospheric phenomenon a little better, rolling their eyes at news reports sensationalizing El Nino and La Nina, and amazing their friends and family with their weather knowledge. Individual user experiences may vary. See your friendly ENSO blogger for details.\" All joking aside, this was an educational post. Thanks for your hard work.

Just read through the BOM ENSO update that was issued today. They are forecasting based on modeling a weak la nina possibly around the .8 range. Is there a way to measure the relative strength of a La Nina which may be enhanced due to the surrounding warm SSTs? Does the SOI measure the relative strength? Submitted by on Tue, 10/01/2024 - 14:20 In reply to by Hi Bob - we do track the relative Oceanic Nino Index, which takes into account the entire tropical oceans, . This isn't the official NOAA metric for ENSO, since we need to do some more research to understand the impacts. Recently, there is a large difference between the Relative ONI and the original-flavor ONI. It will be interesting to monitor both as we head into this likely La Nina winter.

Submitted by on Sat, 10/05/2024 - 16:05 To the extent of my knowledge, we don't have a clear explanation of why this Atlantic hurricane season had such an extended quiet period, followed by this active period. There will be a lot of research to uncover what happened this year and to understand if it could be predicted. Submitted by on Mon, 10/07/2024 - 10:14 In reply to by Or, maybe it had some coffee... On a more serious note, I hope that whoever researches this is able to get some answers, so that future forecasts get a little better. Regardless, thanks for the reply. Submitted by on Mon, 10/07/2024 - 12:22 In reply to by The October run came out. NMME looks ugly for California and many other places in the continental US as far a s precipitation goes and temperature wise almost the entire continental US looks warmer than normal. Submitted by on Tue, 10/08/2024 - 12:39 There currently is a very warm large blob of water west of 180 in the North Pacific. If this warm SST blob persists, could it affect our weather? Submitted by on Tue, 10/08/2024 - 13:11 That's a good question. On one hand, many studies have struggled to find robust impacts of extratropical sea surface temperature anomalies on midlatitude weather (unlike tropical sea surface temperature anomalies that directly impact atmospheric convection and midlatitude ). On the other hand, there have been some indications that North Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies, especially in connection with the Kuroshio-Oyashio extension, could have some impact on our weather. For example, led by one of my postdocs suggests that a warm North Pacific like what we see now is associated with enhanced North Pacific atmospheric blocking, which impacts North American weather. So, I would say the jury is still out! Submitted by on Tue, 10/08/2024 - 13:39 In reply to by Thanks Nathaniel for that explanation!. Weather geeks love to look at the overall SST patterns in the Pacific other than ENSO and compare them to prior years SSTs to come up with a winter forecast. I've always felt that was a bit of folly. Submitted by on Wed, 10/09/2024 - 14:19 In reply to by Yeah, there's a reason why we focus on ENSO in this blog and why seasonal forecasts from dynamical models usually resemble the typical ENSO impacts (with the addition of the trend for temperature) - the impacts of other sea surface temperature patterns tend to be minor. However, that doesn't mean that the impacts of these other patterns are always negligible, and it doesn't mean that our models aren't missing something important. The bottom line, though, is that the atmospheric response to tropical sea surface temperature anomalies, especially from ENSO, is often the dominant seasonal forecast signal.

        "content": "Numbers and the meanings we attach to them can be weird. A number can mean a lot or very little depending on how it is being used, and who is using it. To a Taylor Swift fan, . To many in Western cultures, it is a day of bad luck when falling on a Friday. To others, 13 is just the number that comes after 12. When it comes to climate science and policy, one of our “13s” is the 1.5°C climate threshold, shorthand for global average surface warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. That’s the level of warming that the countries who signed the Paris Agreement have agreed to try to stay below. But what does pre-industrial mean? How do we know when we’ve passed 1.5°C? And what happens if we do? The Industrial Revolution transformed the textile industry in England. This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, When you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to . The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44°C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century. For the 1.5°C climate threshold, the “average” time range is defined as the “pre-industrial period”, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this “pre-industrial period?” It depends. Most history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that’s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1) While there can be differences in what counts as “pre-industrial”, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2) How far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define . For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20t -century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI. Adding to the nuance, itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don’t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive. Suffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures. So, when you come across stories about the 1.5°C threshold—especially if you think you’re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven’t reached 1.5°C— you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the “pre-industrial” time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information. Let’s go back in time before large international climate conferences like existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2°C. As the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize “greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need “to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2°C above preindustrial levels”. However, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at than 2°C of warming. So in 2015, nearly the entire world (195 nations) came together at the United Nations-held international climate meeting COP21 to sign the . This landmark treaty explicitly states that the world’s nations pledged to “hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels,” recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. The relevance of this temperature threshold was explored even more in the In that report, and further supported by subsequent IPCC reports and other scientific literature, they found that limiting global warming to 1.5°C will reduce the impacts on human systems and terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems. It made clear that every increment of global warming above 1.5°C matters for the scope and magnitude of these impacts. Remember, passing this threshold as defined in the Paris Agreement is supposed to reflect when human-caused global warming exceeds 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial times. That is NOT simply when average global temperatures pass that mark on any given day, month, or even year. To know when Earth has passed that threshold, we have to look at longer timescales. Why? Let’s look at a recent example. Global surface temperatures in September, October, and November 2023 exceeded 1.5°C above the pre-industrial period. Does that mean the Paris Agreement has failed? No! Global surface temperatures can be influenced not only by human-caused climate change, but also by natural climate factors like El Niño and random weather. When combined, these factors can briefly push monthly or even yearly global temperatures above 1.5°C; that doesn’t mean 1.5°C is the new normal. Human-induced warming (blue shading) reached approximately 1°C above pre-industrial levels in 2017. At the present rate, global temperatures would reach 1.5°C around 2040. Stylized 1.5°C pathway shown here (green shading) involves emission reductions beginning immediately, and CO emissions reaching zero by 2055. Graphic appears in FAQ 1.2 in the supplement to the IPCC Special Report on Instead, we need to average the temperature anomalies over a period of time like 20 to 30 years. Averaging helps to smooth away any of the rough edges caused by natural warming factors and better reveals the long-term trend. That is why it can be said at the same time that global temperatures have reached 1.1°C above the pre-industrial in 2011-2020 (according to the IPCC 6 assessment report), and that global temperatures in September 2023 were 1.5C above the pre-industrial. It's also important to note that the Paris Agreement does not specify how many years should make up this long-term trend, which dataset should be used, and which time period makes up the pre-industrial period. That means different scientists, governments and groups might come to different conclusions about when Earth passes this critical threshold. Absolutely not. Millions of people globally are already experiencing impacts of climate change in the form of extreme temperatures, heavy rains, flooding, and more. The 1.5°C climate threshold is not a light switch that turns on all sorts of climate calamities. For every little bit of additional warming, the risk of negative impacts gets worse. So why did the Paris Agreement define the global temperature target of 1.5°C? Because both models and paleoclimate data show that beyond 1.5°C, the risk of severe impacts to some ecosystems and locations—including places where people are least responsible for the problem—become larger than the world as a whole was willing to accept. Urgent action in this decade is essential for trying to minimize these impacts. Temperature change is not uniform across the globe. Projected changes are shown for the average temperature of the annual hottest day (top) and the annual coldest night (bottom) with 1.5°C of global warming (left) and 2°C of global warming (right) compared to pre-industrial levels. Graphic appears in FAQ 3.1 in the supplement to the IPCC Special Report on The 1.5°C limit is sort of like a highway speed limit. Backed by plenty of science about the dangers of speeding, we know that every bit of additional speed increases the danger of an accident. There is no single speed below which the risks are zero and above which (within reason) an accident is guaranteed to occur or to be deadly. Still, we pick a limit beyond which the risks become larger than we are willing to tolerate. (Footnote 3) Our best bet as drivers and human beings affecting the climate is to not push our luck, especially when some of consequences—societal, economic, or ecological—could be dire. Looking at what models predict for the near term (next 9 months), monthly global temperatures look to remain quite warm through the beginning of 2024 before beginning to fall from that perch as the calendar shifts into spring. This is consistent with how we know El Niño impacts global temperatures; this period coincides with the forecasted weakening of the current El Niño. (Footnote 4) Monthly average temperatures (red dots and line) rose to more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average in late 2023. On average, forecasts from the North American Multi-model Ensemble (NMME) system indicate temperatures are likely to decline a bit—though remaining quite warm from a historical perspective—as the strong Niño currently underway begins to fade in early 2024. NOAA Climate.gov graph based on data from NCEI and Emily Becker/IRI. In May 2023, the World Meteorological Organization forecasted that annual global temperatures were predicted to have a of exceeding 1.5°C for at least 1 year between 2023-2027 (Footnote 2). This is consistent with how we expect continued global warming to affect temperature trends over multi-year time periods and the likelihood for a strong El Niño to supercharge warming in a given year. So when will we reach 1.5°C? According to the : “In the considered scenarios and modeled pathways, the best estimates of the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term (2021-2040).” And global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low greenhouse gas emission scenarios. That means we not only have no time to lose in reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions, but that we should also be thinking about how to make the things that matter to us, from our communities to our natural resources, better able to withstand—at the very least—that level of warming. 1) Before 2023, NOAA used 1880-1900. Once NOAA’s dataset was extended back to 1850, so did the pre-industrial time period. 2) Paleorecords help us extend even farther back which is one way in determining just how much current warming differs from natural patterns 3) This monthly global surface temperature forecast was provided by Emily Becker and comes from the North American multi-model ensemble (NMME) model members that were available on January 8.

        "content": "Earlier this week, NOAA launched a new website for monitoring and forecasting the size and intensity of ocean heat waves up to a year in advance. According to the experimental forecast issued in June, 50 percent of the global oceans could experience heat wave conditions by September 2023. The also estimates how large and intense heat waves are without global warming’s influence on the ocean over the past three decades. Without the warming effect, the models predict that only 25 percent of the global ocean will be impacted by heat waves in September. This pair of maps shows the probability that monthly average temperature in September will end up being in the warmest 10 percent (the 90th percentile) of Septembers for a given location between 1991 and 2020. The top map shows the forecast with the effects of long-term warming included, and the bottom map shows the forecast without the observed sea surface temperature trend between 1991 and 2020. Places that are darkest blue indicate a less than 10 percent chance of experiencing a heat wave; places that are brightest yellow indicate that the chance of a heat wave is greater than 90 percent. Much more of the ocean, especially in the Indian and Pacific basins, is colored blue and purple in the bottom image, meaning that much less of the ocean is expected to experience a September heat wave when the influence of global warming over the past three decades is removed. A notable exception is the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, where the forecast indicates a high chance of a heat wave even without long-term warming, thanks to the In the Atlantic, meanwhile, the climate system appears to have been primed for a hot summer. While the chances of a heatwave across the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and tropical Atlantic would have been lower in a world without warming (bottom image), they were still pretty substantial–over 50 percent in many areas (dark pink to orange). As it is, however, the odds are greater than 70 percent across most of the region, and above 90 percent in places.

El Niño is zipping along in the tropical Pacific. There’s a that this El Niño event will end up “historically strong” (more details below), potentially ranking in the top 5 on record. Looking ahead, it’s likely that El Niño will end and neutral conditions return by April­–June. El Niño is associated with specific changes to weather and climate around the world, and the stronger an El Niño, the more likely we are to see those impacts. Of course, nothing is ever guaranteed when it comes to our complex Earth system, and the unpredictable effect of chaos may interrupt the expected impacts. For an excellent, in-depth explanation of why a strong El Niño provides the best information for making seasonal predictions, and yet weather can still upend those predictions, check out . Map of sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean compared to the long-term average in November 2023. The waters in the key monitoring region, which scientists call \"the Niño-3.4 region,\" are much warmer than average (red), illustrating the strong El Niño. NOAA Climate.gov, based on Coral Reef Watch maps available from Our primary metric for the strength of an ENSO event (ENSO = El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the whole El Niño and La Niña system) is the three-month-average temperature of the central tropical Pacific Ocean, specifically in the Niño-3.4 region. The temperature anomaly—the difference from the long-term average, where long-term is currently 1991–2020—in this region is called the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI). We use a three-month average because ENSO is a seasonal phenomenon, meaning it persists for at least several months. We don’t have official strength definitions, but, unofficially, an ONI anomaly of 1.5 °C or warmer is considered a strong El Niño, with 2.0 °C the threshold for “very strong” or “historically strong.” 2-year history of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for all events evolving into El Niño since 1950 (gray lines) and the current event (purple line). NOAA Climate.gov image based on a graph by Emily Becker and monthly Niño-3.4 index data using . The most recent ONI anomaly, for , was 1.8 °C. November, what I’m showing here in this graph, was 2.0 °C. Many of our predict that it will hang out at or above 2.0 °C long enough to achieve “historically strong” status. The El Niño events in our (starting in 1950) with the largest Oceanic Niño Index values are 1972–73 (2.1 °C), 1982–83 (2.2 °C), 1997–98 (2.4 °C), and 2015–16 (2.6 °C). Maybe you’re wondering if the fact that those numbers are in increasing order means that El Niño is getting stronger overall? It probably is not. First, I’ve only picked out the very strongest El Niño winters from the 25 in our record, and there are plenty of weaker events sprinkled in. Also, it’s very unlikely that this event will top 2.5 °C, which would break the pattern. Instead, the gradual rise in the strongest ONI anomalies is more likely a sign that that some influence from global warming remains in the Oceanic Niño Index, even though it by using a rolling 30-year period as our long-term average. For more on this complication, as well as a possible solution, check out Michelle’s post “ She also has , written with colleagues at the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia, that gives details on an alternative ENSO index. El Niño is more than sea surface temperature, though. The atmospheric component is just as important, as the atmospheric circulation above the tropical Pacific—the —responds to the changes in the ocean surface temperature and helps to reinforce them. This is critical to ENSO. In the case of El Niño, the warmer-than-average central and/or eastern tropical Pacific leads to more rising air and storms over that region, less over Indonesia, and weaker-than-average upper-level winds and near-surface winds (the trade winds). Overall, this means a weaker Walker circulation. Outgoing long-wave radiation anomaly from November 11 - December 6, 2023. Regions with more clouds and rain than average are shown in blue; areas with fewer clouds and less rain are shown in orange. Climate.gov image from CPC data. So how is the atmosphere looking, with our current strong, possibly on its way to very strong, El Niño? Looking at the map above, we see a pretty clear signal over the past 30 days of more clouds over the central Pacific (purple, showing that less surface radiation is escaping to space, because it’s being blocked by clouds) and less over Indonesia (orange, where more radiation is making it to the satellites, because there are fewer clouds). There are a few other ways of measuring the atmospheric response. The Southern Oscillation Index compares the surface pressure in Tahiti to that in Darwin, Australia. When the pressure is lower than average in Tahiti and higher than average in Darwin (a negative index), it is an indication that the Walker circulation is weakened. In November, this index was -0.8. The Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is another measure of pressure patterns across the tropical Pacific, specifically the average over the western Pacific versus the average over the eastern Pacific. As with the original Southern Oscillation Index, a negative Equatorial SOI shows that the Walker circulation is weaker than average. November 2023 was -1.3. For context, this means the atmospheric signal is approximately in the top third of all El Niño events for this time of year. Location of the stations used for the Southern Oscillation Index (Tahiti and Darwin, black dots), the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index (eastern equatorial Pacific and Indonesia regions, outlined in blue-green), and the Niño3.4 region in the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean for sea surface temperature (red dashed line). NOAA Climate.gov image by Fiona Martin. Why do we have that sound like they measure the same thing? The Southern Oscillation Index extends back to 1866, but only measures the pressure at two specific stations, meaning it is more susceptible to short-term weather fluctuations. The Equatorial SOI record starts in 1950, same as our well-observed sea surface temperature record, and measures the average over two very large geographic regions. The larger areas mean that the Equatorial SOI is more resistant to the variability caused by random storms influencing a certain location, etc. Near the equator, the steady, east-to-west trade winds usually keep warm water piled up in the far western Pacific. When they slow, this warm water can slosh eastward under the surface as a .

Graph by climate.gov from CPC data. There were some pretty strong “westerly wind bursts,” what we call it when the trade winds slow, during November. These events kicked off a , increasing the amount of warm water under the surface of the Pacific. The amount of warm water is still lagging behind what it was during the strongest events on record, as I discussed in , but it’s a solid source of warm water that will continue to feed the surface over the next few months.

Blue bars show the chances of La Niña, gray bars the chances for neutral, and red bars the chances for El Niño. Graph by Michelle L'Heureux. What goes up must come down! Our current thinking is that neutral conditions are most likely to develop by April­–June. Then… what’s that blue bar lurking on the right side?? La Niña and neutral are nearly even odds for July­–September, with El Niño a distant third. Most, but not all, of the stronger El Niño events in our historical record were followed by La Niña, so that would not be unusual. We’ll be back with more information when we get back from climbing Everest… I mean, next month! Thanks, very interesting! Submitted by on Thu, 12/14/2023 - 22:55 These are all very interesting data points and the author seems to take several liberties in analyzing and interpretation. It overlooks key climate indicators and fails to address the nuanced interactions that actually contribute to the phenomenon. A more comprehensive examination, considering factors like celestial hydroflux dynamics, ionospheric resonance, coupled with the Milankovitch cycles and the Beinhoff scale of temperature variances in the upper equatorial altitudes, would provide a more accurate portrayal of the complex processes involved in a strong, or super strong, El Nino. Submitted by on Fri, 12/15/2023 - 10:00 \" celestial hydroflux dynamics\" and \"Beinhoff scale\" do not show up in any Google Scholar search Submitted by on Fri, 12/22/2023 - 00:52 In reply to by In response to the critique of the original analysis, it's imperative to consider the complexities of climatological phenomena through a multifaceted lens. The critique overlooks the fundamental principles of Thermolunar Vibroscopy, a pivotal concept in understanding celestial impacts on climate patterns. Furthermore, the interaction of Photonic Wind Shear with the Earth's Magnetohydrodynamic Permeability offers a substantial explanatory framework for the anomalies observed during strong El Niño events. Additionally, the critique fails to recognize the significance of Quantum Atmospheric Synchronicity, a leading-edge concept that bridges the gap between microscale meteorological events and macroscale atmospheric dynamics. This is particularly crucial when considering the role of Substratospheric Vapor Induction in global weather patterns. Moreover, the integration of Gravitational Wave Flux Analysis, a technique that has revolutionized our understanding of cosmic influences on Earth's climate, provides critical insights that should not be dismissed. This methodology, combined with the principles of Neoplasmaic Particle Distribution in the troposphere, offers a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate dynamics at play. In summary, while the original analysis may seem unconventional, it's grounded in a series of advanced, albeit theoretical, scientific concepts that merit further exploration and validation within the scientific community. Submitted by on Wed, 01/03/2024 - 04:48 In reply to by I've seen through decades (including one time CPC forecaster) too many contradictions between El Nino/La Nina based expectations to take seriously any specific time period. Most explicit example was last year's extreme rain/snow/flooding through California totally inconsistent with designated La Nina period. But right on with El Nino expectations including the southern jet. In my opinion forecasts based on La Nina/El Nino are an exercise in futility and invoked when nothing else to go with. BTW: The mean current atmospheric circulation over US/Canada is not El Nino like and expected southern El Nino jet has yet to appear. Too many external actors at play to overwhelm whatever inherent ENSO might exist.

Your broader point (that the influence of El Niño and La Niña can be and often are overwhelmed by other atmospheric actors), that's a reality our bloggers don't shy away from discussing. NOAA's seasonal forecasts aren't based solely on some kind of ENSO binary, in which forecasters decide in the fall that El Niño is here and then take the rest of the winter off. This blog has always been straightforward about the limits of seasonal forecasts in general, as well as the limits of ENSO as influence on those forecasts. But over the years, we have also provided plenty of evidence that suggests your statement about \"futility\" is an exaggeration. Simple statistics show that there are locations in the U.S. that are more likely to have wet/dry/warm/cool winters during El Niño and La Niña. Sure, we can debate exactly how reliable a signal would need to be in order to be useful for a given purpose, but its just not \"fair\" (i.e. consistent with the data) to say that ENSO has utility for seasonal forecasting. Submitted by on Fri, 12/15/2023 - 12:20 In reply to by Here in the Pacific Northwest the El Nino/ La Nina impact on snow pack seems to hold this time around. I intentionally did not buy a downhill ski pass due to the El Nino prediction (I'm enjoying cross country instead.) However as I recall we had a fair amount of snow in early 2016 even with a strong El Nino. The year prior 2015 had very little snow: it was warm as if the predicted El Nino had come. Submitted by on Mon, 12/25/2023 - 20:58 In reply to by Climate anomalies based on El Nino is inherently probabilistic. It won't *always* lead to the expected impact (sometimes it will be opposite), but, for some regions, *most of the time* it should lead to the expected impact. Unfortunately the El Nino-less snowfall relationship (in the Pac NW) seems to be one of the more robust signals. Submitted by on Tue, 12/26/2023 - 09:50 In reply to by Thanks for the explanation, and for the detailed information about the ongoing El Niño. It will be interesting seeing how it influences the weather here in Oklahoma this winter. On a different note, I remember reading a previous post about how it is really hard to predict future ENSO conditions in the spring, due to something that its author referred to as the spring predictability barrier. So, does that also influence forecasts made now about ENSO conditions next summer and fall? Submitted by on Fri, 12/15/2023 - 19:30 Great observation and absolutely, yes, it affects these predictions which go through the 'spring barrier.' With that said, despite the lower skill/accuracy, there are times when we weight the models a bit more-- and a La Nina following a strong El Nino tends to be one of those times. Still expect those probabilities to shift as we go forward and get more information. Submitted by on Sat, 12/16/2023 - 07:42 In reply to by Very interesting answer. It sounds like, when you make ENSO forecasts for the next few months (beyond the \"spring barrier\"), you incorporate what has happened in the past (when it has been similar to the present) when making your predictions. Is this correct? Submitted by on Sat, 12/16/2023 - 17:15 In reply to by Yes, not in isolation, but it is something many forecasters take note of. That's because there are certain physical processes that are known, and if we see them happening we can become more confident in a transition. For instance: Submitted by on Sun, 12/17/2023 - 09:37 What was in that blog post made sense, as does incorporating insights from that El Niño (and previous strong ones) into predictions for when this one will end.

I've also been tracking the giant iceberg, A23a, that just left Antarctica, and I'm wondering: Do these large ice burgs have any impact on the global ocean temperature fluctuations, or are the oceans just too big for these to matter much more than locally? Anyway, keep up the good work, I'm learning lots, and I really appreciate you all! Submitted by on Thu, 12/28/2023 - 12:45 Super interesting update ahead of the peak of El Niño, as global climate anomalies are inevitably linked to what ENSO does! So far, global surface air and sea temps are quite elevated in concert with the coming El Niño peak, which is in line with expectations. However, there are 2 questions I'm sure a few folks interested in the current ENSO phase share: - After an unexpected three-peat La Niña, that stunningly, did not bring typical cooler ocean & air temps to the planet, what are the probabilistic indicators suggesting this current El Niño phase is likely to exhaust itself by April, potentially transitioning back to (ahem) \"cool\" La Niña? - J. Hansen published an interesting note in a mid-December Columbia U piece that touches on ENSO, specifically to dispel the notion the El Niño phase is a causal driver of global warming. By looking strictly at the Nino 3.4 Pacific region Sea Surface Temp anomaly, Hansen and his colleagues maintain the 2016 and this 2024 El Niño are successively events than the massive 1998 event. This is confusing given that many other credible sources say 2016 was / 2024 will be as \"big\" as 1998. So will 2024 be a big one, or is something else going on here? I.E. is the planet so warm that ENSO as an indicator of \"warm\" / \"cool\" years, is out the window, so to speak? Cheers & Happy New Year to all! Submitted by on Thu, 01/04/2024 - 01:05 It's an interesting read and I did learn a few things. Some of the comments were entertaining as well. What I've learned to count on regarding weather forecasting is two things: 1. My window, and 2. My weather rock. There is always a 100% chance of weather. Submitted by on Thu, 01/04/2024 - 11:09 Any ideas on why El Nino has not resulted in the usual precipitation impacts to California thus far? Submitted by on Thu, 01/04/2024 - 12:03 I've heard that the rainy season in parts of Central America has not yet ended, even though it's normally over by now (with December also normally dry). So, does El Niño have any influence on this? If so, what? Submitted by on Mon, 01/08/2024 - 18:41 El Niño tens to influence the climate in Central America more in the summer and fall and is related to drier than average conditions. So it's not impossible that El Nino is playing a part here, but it's not a direct connection to the extended rainy season in Central America. Submitted by on Tue, 01/09/2024 - 11:41 In reply to by Thanks for the response. That said, I was still really curious about this topic after posting my question, so I did a web search about it (search term: efectos de El Niño en Costa Rica). And, by looking at trustworthy sites, I got an answer: During El Niño, the trade winds across the Caribbean get stronger, which results in the Caribbean coast getting more rainfall and the Pacific coast being drier. From looking at NOAA satellite images, it looks like this is what is happening, especially in Costa Rica and Panama (as well as Nicaragua). I know that El Niño is just one factor with this, and that there are others (such as global warming and the MJO) that are probably influencing this. But, I thought it was interesting, so I figured I'd share it with you. Submitted by on Tue, 01/09/2024 - 16:05 In reply to by Thanks for sharing! I am aware that El Nino tends to bring wetter conditions to the southern US and much of Mexico due to the extension of the subtropical jet, and drier conditions to the south (like Costa Rica), but I was not aware of some of the possible more localized impacts over the region. Submitted by on Wed, 01/10/2024 - 17:10 In reply to by 2023 had a mixed response not associated only to El Niño. Our Caribbean coast experienced a severe drought, much greater than that one of the Pacific, which is not usual during El Niño, and even less so during a strong El Niño. Certainly, the extraordinary warming in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean played a key roles in this year's climate variability. Submitted by on Thu, 01/11/2024 - 17:26 In reply to by Hi.

The tropical Pacific sure knows how to get out of a rut! Just two months after of an almost interminable La Niña, above-average surface temperatures have reclaimed the tropical Pacific, and temperatures in the central-eastern Pacific are expected to continue to rise. Consequently, an remains in place, with El Niño conditions likely to develop within the next couple of months and then persisting ( ) into the winter. We care about the potential development of El Niño—the warm phase of (El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the whole El Niño-La Niña system)—because of the that arise from its occurrence, including the expected temperature and precipitation patterns shown . We’ll revisit many of these impacts in the coming months, but we’ll start by focusing on all the details of these rapidly developing conditions in the tropical Pacific. According to (our most consistent historical dataset), the April average sea surface temperature in the (our primary monitoring region for ENSO) was 0.1 °C above the long-term (1991–2020) average. This value is up 0.2 °C from March and is the first time the monthly Niño-3.4 temperature was warmer than average since April of 2020. 16-month history of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for all events evolving into El Niño since 1950 (gray lines) and the current event (purple line). NOAA Climate.gov image based on a graph by Michelle L’Heureux and monthly Niño-3.4 index data using . When we zoom into the weekly time frame, we find that the latest from our highest-resolution dataset ( ) was 0.4 °C above the long-term average, even higher than the latest monthly average. This is just a mere 0.1 °C away from the 0.5 °C threshold that is for declaring El Niño conditions. Subsurface ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific also , providing a source of warmer water that can sustain a developing El Niño. How can La Niña seem like a distant memory so quickly? Although the tropical Pacific Ocean looks ready to burst through that door to El Niño, the tropical atmosphere seems a bit more hesitant, remaining firmly in ENSO-neutral territory. As in March, the April and the were close to zero, indicating that the remains at near-average strength. For El Niño conditions, we would expect negative values of these , which would indicate (1) a weakening in the surface pressure difference that normally exists between the western and central-eastern Pacific and (2) a reduction of the east-to-west surface trade winds that are the key component of the Walker circulation. (For La Niña conditions, we get the opposite – positive index values indicating a strengthened Walker circulation and stronger east-to-west trade winds across the tropical Pacific Ocean.) Summary of NOAA decision process in determining El Niño conditions. NOAA Climate.gov drawing by Glen Becker and Fiona Martin. Note that even if the monthly average Niño-3.4 index soon exceeds the 0.5 °C threshold for El Niño, forecasters will not declare onset of El Niño unless the tropical atmosphere is clearly responding in the expected way, including a weakening of the Walker circulation. Forecasters have high confidence in an upcoming El Niño not only because of the rapidly changing tropical Pacific Ocean conditions but also because of the strong agreement from the latest computer model predictions. The current forecast from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble ( ), a set of state-of-the-art computer climate models, indicates that the Niño-3.4 sea surface temperature is very likely to climb above the El Niño threshold within a couple of months and remain in El Niño territory for the remainder of the forecast period.

The black line shows the model forecast average; darker gray envelope shows the range of 68% of all model forecasts; lighter gray shows the range of 95% of all model forecasts. NOAA Climate.gov image based on a graph from Emily Becker. In short, the signs of El Niño development that we saw have only grown stronger this month. Additionally, we’ve pushed one more month through the dreaded (also check out , , and Michelle’s latest post ). Taken together, these signals have allowed forecasters to increase their forecast confidence this month, with the likelihood of El Niño approaching 90% by summer and exceeding 90% through next fall and winter.

Following the method described in , the for a strong El Niño (Niño-3.4 index greater than 1.5 °C) is approximately 55%, which is up almost 15% since last month. We may have a better handle on the potential strength of this event, assuming it develops (still a 5-10% chance it doesn’t!), once we fully get past the spring predictability barrier. Warm ocean conditions are not just limited to the tropical Pacific. Despite some ocean temperatures off the West Coast of the U.S., the remarkably warm global ocean has grabbed . April 2023 sea surface temperature difference from the 1985-1993 average (details from . Most of the global oceans were warmer than average. NOAA Climate.gov image from For some additional perspective on this widespread warmth, I reached out to , an oceanographer of the with expertise in sea surface temperature reconstructions. Dr. Huang kindly provided the following plots of near-globally averaged sea surface temperature time series for two of our most used sea surface temperature datasets, monthly ERSSTv5 and daily OISSTv2.1. Non-polar (60 °N – 60 °S) global averaged sea surface temperature from 1982-2023 from (top) daily and (bottom) monthly datasets. The thick black lines represent the 1982-2011 average across the calendar year; 2022 (orange line), 2023 (thick red line), and 2016 (the year of record warmth before 2023; thin red line) are highlighted. The thin grey lines represent all other years. The top graph indicates that 2023 reached record warm levels since mid-March in OISST; however, the bottom graph indicates that peak temperatures in ERSST have not clearly exceeded the record warmth of March 2016 in that dataset. Nevertheless, both datasets indicate that April 2023 was warmer than any previous April on record. NOAA Climate.gov image based on graphs by Boyin Huang and data from . First, we note that while the two datasets are not identical, as way back when, both the ERSST and OISST datasets confirm that the global oceans are currently sizzling. However, they do have minor disagreements about . Although the global (non-polar) ocean surface temperatures have been warmer than at any point over the past 40 years in the OISST dataset since mid-March, the ERSST dataset has trailed the record warmth of 2016, at least until recently. However, Dr. Huang confirms a point of agreement: both datasets indicate that the global ocean surface was warmer in April 2023 than in any previous April. How would a developing El Niño relate to the global ocean temperatures? First, as Emily noted last month, than in La Niña or ENSO-neutral years. Given how warm the oceans are already, a developing El Niño would only increase the chance of record-breaking global ocean temperatures (and global average temperature over both ocean and land), which likely would have important ecological consequences, including for fish and . Another factor to consider is that the widespread ocean warmth may make it a little more challenging for the warm temperatures in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific to induce a tropical atmospheric response (maybe a reason for the current ENSO-neutral looking tropical atmosphere?). The reason is that the response of the tropical atmosphere depends on surface temperatures in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific . If those surrounding tropical regions are also warmer than average, then the bar is even higher for the Niño-3.4 region surface temperature anomalies to induce an atmospheric response (see footnote). The bottom line is that in terms of a push on the tropical atmosphere, we need to consider that the Niño-3.4 index may punch below its weight while it’s hovering in borderline El Niño territory, as it is now. However, if the central-eastern Pacific continues to warm up, we can expect that the atmosphere will feel that push eventually. You probably noticed that you aren’t being treated to the ENSO update eloquence that Emily usually provides each month. Don’t worry – Emily will be back later this month with a post talking about our favorite blend of computer prediction models, the NMME. Also, be sure to check out NOAA’s outlook for the 2023 hurricane season that comes out in just a couple weeks (May 25th). One of biggest implications of a developing El Niño in the shorter term is its potential influence on the . In brief, Atlantic hurricane seasons tend to be less active during El Niño, while the Pacific season is often enhanced. That means this month’s ENSO forecast is likely one of the factors that will be considered in the hurricane outlook. In the meantime, keep your eyes peeled on the tropics, and don’t blink – conditions are evolving quickly!

I say die El Niño before September Submitted by on Mon, 05/22/2023 - 09:32 In reply to by I always appreciate the great ENSO blog for its interesting content! I am currently wondering whether the unusually cold ocean temperatures off the West Coast of the U.S., reminiscent of a negative phase of Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM), may inhibit the development of El Nino as the negative PMM induces easterly anomalies (or impairs westerly anomalies) in the tropical Pacific. If this is the case, the El Nino conditions may grow less than expected. Submitted by on Thu, 05/11/2023 - 17:35 Great observation! The PMM is certainly not in a phase that would be conducive to El Ninos and it extends enough to the tropics that it could have some bearing on Nino3.4. This is one of those wildcard factors the contribute to that 5-10% chance of no El Nino developing along with a weaker strength event if one does form. Submitted by on Fri, 05/12/2023 - 09:55 In reply to by Great post and thanks for the cool and descriptive analysis. You mention RONI, what about MEI? I’ve always thought a multivariate approach a good one for defining ENSO phase. Thanks again! Submitted by on Thu, 05/11/2023 - 20:26 Great question Greg! So the MEI is a perfectly valid ENSO index for certain applications but in operations, we prefer indices that are also provided at monthly mean resolution (the ONI can be split into monthly Nino3.4 index values which can be used in real time declaration). Also, as we mention in this , it can be difficult to dynamically understand what is going on when using combined indices like the MEI. It is useful to us to see the OLR index by itself, the SOI index by itself, etc, etc. When the indices are all combined, we can't rule out that one variable is dominating the rest (Example: SSTs are consistent with El Nino, but none of the other atmospheric indices are participating). Further, the have a lot of investment and time put into climate homogenization meaning we can, fairly confidently, compare today's value with one in the past (at least since the 1950s). I can't say the same about gridded datasets of winds, etc. And, lastly, SST trends are and we probably need this to be addressed for SST variables in the MEI as well. Hope that helps.

After an extremely dry spring, fires ran amok, ravaging most of peninsular Florida. It was after this event, that the US Forestry Service began prescribed burns on a rotational basis. These burns were called controlled burns at that time until the US Forestry Service realized that these too can become uncontrolled, so they renamed them to 'prescribed burns'.

Submitted by on Mon, 05/29/2023 - 23:01 Thanks for the blog. I find it very informative. I have a question though. In this post you state that El Niño often leads to higher air surface temperatures, which would lead to higher sea surface temperatures. You reference an earlier post, which gives the reason for the increase in air surface temperatures. As I understood it, the reason for higher surface temps during El Niño was due to higher evaporation off the ocean, leading to increased transfer of latent heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. In other words, we're transferring more heat from ocean to atmosphere during El Niño. My question is how can the SST be expected to go up during El Niño when the latent heat flux out of the ocean is expected to be higher? Does that mean the conductive transfer of heat in from the atmosphere outweighs the increased advective latent heat flux out? I'm not a climate scientist, and I'm not doing the calculation right now, but I would usually predict that advective latent heat flux moves more heat than conduction. In addition, during El Niño, the higher evaporation leads to more cloud formation, which also reduces the radiant heat influx to the ocean. So, from my simplistic understanding, I see that during El Niño we have increased heat advective heat flux out of the ocean, and reduced radiant heat flux in to the ocean. So, I'm having a hard time seeing how El Niño would result in an increased global SST. I guess I would intuitively predict the opposite. Submitted by on Tue, 05/30/2023 - 08:18 That's a good question, and I understand how this can be confusing. It's true that an increase in the latent heat flux out of the ocean should lead to of the ocean surface, not a warming. It's important to recognize that in the main \"action center\" of El Nino in the tropical Pacific, the heating is driven by the transport of ocean heat through the \"Bjerknes feedback,\" as described in . The cooling influence of the increased evaporation (as well as that of the cloud shading) is a that offsets the warming, but it's not strong enough to overcome the warming influence the Bjerknes feedback. Outside of the main Pacific action center, there isn't a significant change in evaporation to compete with the atmospheric warming that spreads away from the central-eastern Pacific. Submitted by on Tue, 05/30/2023 - 19:29 In reply to by I have a farm in the highlands of Central Mexico and the impacts of ENSO on our drought-prone region are obviously very important, but also extremely unclear. I have been studying the historic charts for ENSO and it just isn't obvious how our rainfall is impacted. Right now El Niño is forecast to bring us drought. But it seems to me - and I am not at all a scientist - there are too many other factors to make a clear prognosis. This makes life very difficult to plan our farms. In our region, campesino farmers rely on the monsoon rains that start in May-June and run through October more or less. Right now, in June, we are having a drought. Hotter and drier, the monsoon rains are not in the forecast at all. We should be planting now but the ground is totally dry. But we are in a Neutral phase now, which in the past has not been a problem. So obviously there are other factors at play. I just wonder, with the climate being so complex, and climate change playing havoc with the whole system, if it is possible at all to really make helpful forecasts that allow farmers to prepare for their season. Submitted by on Sat, 06/03/2023 - 11:02 I can empathize with the struggle you describe. Unfortunately, the ENSO signal doesn't always stand out among all competing factors, and often times those competing factors are more difficult to predict than ENSO months or seasons in advance. However, I still believe that the ENSO signal is strong enough to provide some guidance to farmers, as suggested in from a couple of years ago. In addition to checking the charts related to past ENSO episodes, I might suggest checking some forecast maps from state-of-the-art seasonal forecast models, like from the NMME ( and maps). As you can see from those links, you can get both spatial maps of anomalies (like for precipitation) and model skill, so you have an idea how reliable the models are. These forecasts can complement the ENSO-related guidance, so you could see if the models are consistent with expected ENSO impacts, if there may be some other signal that the models are seeing, or if the models are inconsistent/unskillful for the region, lead time, and variable of interest.

This value is 0.15°C (0.27°F) more than the previous record set in 2016. The 10 warmest years in the 174-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2014–2023). Of note, the year 2005, which was the first year to set a new global temperature record in the 21st century, is now the 12th-warmest year on record. The year 2010, which had surpassed 2005 at the time, now ranks as the 11th-warmest year on record. This map shows 2023 temperatures compared to the 1991-2020 average. Most of the globe was warmer-than-average (red). Only a few areas were colder than average (blue). The animated bar graph shows yearly average temperature since 1976 compared to the 20th-century average. It's been 47 years—nearly half a century—since Earth's temperature was colder than average. 2023 set a new warmest-year record by a wide margin. Unlike the previous two years (2021 and 2022), which were squarely entrenched in a cold phase episode, also known as La Niña, 2023 quickly moved into ENSO neutral territory, transitioning to a warm phase episode, El Niño, by June. ENSO not only affects global weather patterns, but it also affects global temperatures. As seen in the image below, during the warm phase of ENSO (El Niño), global temperatures tend to be warmer than ENSO-neutral or La Niña years, while global temperatures tend to be slightly cooler during cold phase ENSO episodes (La Niña). Despite 2021 and 2022 not ranking among the five warmest years on record, the global annual temperature increased at an average rate of 0.06°C (0.11°F) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.20°C / 0.36°F) since 1982.

The worst of the flooding occurred in southwestern Connecticut and Long Island, New York, where more than 10 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period. The National Weather Service issued , which are warnings reserved for exceedingly rare situations in which extreme rainfall is leading to a severe threat to life and catastrophic damage. During the , mudslides washed out roads, streets were inundated with flood waters, and swift-water rescues were necessary. The highest 24-hour rainfall totals were 14.83 inches and 13.5 inches near Oxford, Connecticut. Both values are under by a State Climate Extremes Committee to determine if either location officially broke the 24-hour state rainfall record for Connecticut. The previous record was 12.77 inches set on August 19, 1955, from Hurricane Diane. If the high-end total is confirmed, it would qualify as a 1-in-1,000-year extreme rainfall event, based on . A 1-in-1,000-year event does not mean that these events can only happen once every 1,000 years, but that over long periods of time, the average return frequency would be every 1,000 years.

In Connecticut, some rainfall totals during this event are under investigation for setting a new record for most rain observed in a 24-hour period.

Less than 12 hours later, as the slow-moving front pushed east, more training storms set up about 30 miles south along Long Island, bringing extreme rainfall to the region. More than 10 inches of rain was reported by a National Weather Service employee near Sound Beach, qualifying as a 1-in-200-year rainfall event. This was not the first extreme rainfall event to happen across the Northeast this summer. There have been at least three other extreme rainfall events that have produced at least one 1-in-200-year rainfall event, two of which were associated with the remnants of and . The third was an extreme rainfall event across northeastern Vermont on July 30, which resulted in at least two 1-in-500-year rainfall events. Every extreme rain event has a variety of causes and influences; increasingly human-caused climate change is one them. According to the (NCA5), precipitation across the Northeast is increasing across all seasons, and extreme precipitation events have increased nearly 60 percent in the region–the largest increase in the United States. The report states that some of these changes may in part be due to tropical systems, but also note that there is more overall water availability (in the air) throughout the region due to warming temperatures (warmer air is able to hold onto more water). The four charts show the number of daily events per year with precipitation totals equal to or exceeding 2, 3, 4, and 5 inches from 1958–2022 (blue lines), along with trend lines (black) computed from linear regressions over the full period. Numbers in the top left corner show the percent increase relative to the long-term average, computed as the difference between the end points of the trend lines divided by the 1958–2022 average. The number of daily events is defined as the total number of extreme precipitation accumulations recorded at all stations across the observing network in the Northeast. See the figure metadata for details on the methodology. The trends shown suggest an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation, with larger increases for the more extreme precipitation events. Figure adapted from The blue lines in the graphs above show the number of days per year in the Northeast with extreme precipitation. The trend lines (black) show the overall increase in frequency of these extreme precipitation days over the last several decades, with even larger increases for more extreme precipitation events. Extreme precipitation events of all sizes are occurring more often now across the Northeast, and the scales are tipped even toward the highest-end precipitation events—those that tend to have large impacts on people, lives, and property. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased across much of the United States, particularly the eastern part of the continental US, with implications for flood risk and infrastructure planning. Maps show observed changes in three measures of extreme precipitation: (a) total precipitation falling on the heaviest 1% of days from 1958–2021. Numbers in black circles depict percent changes at the regional level. Data were not available for the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands and the US Virgin Islands. Image adapted from NCA5 also concluded that there is “robust evidence that human-caused warming has contributed to increases in the frequency and severity of the heaviest precipitation events across nearly 70% of the U.S.” The report also states paleoclimate records indicate that summer moisture has increased over the past century in parts of New England, the central-eastern United States, and the northern Mississippi River Valley. If the globe continues to warm, more changes in precipitation are likely and will vary by location. According to NCA5, additional are expected with every degree of warming across the Northeast.

The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA ), with periodic guest contributors.

You’ll have to excuse this ENSO Blogger for a minute while I drink some sweet tea on the porch and lament about all the heat and humidity, “Woof, it’s hot!” Things truly seem to move slower during the dog days of summer in late July and early August. And it seems like the El Niño/Southern Oscillation ( ), a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific Ocean that can affect weather across the world, is no exception. The expected transition from ENSO-Neutral to La Niña continues to proceed slowly, as if the whole Pacific is stuck in a summer daze, moving as slow as molasses. According to the August , ENSO-Neutral conditions remain across the Pacific, with La Niña favored to develop during Autumn (66% chance) before persisting through the Northern Hemisphere winter (74% chance during November-January). Out of the three climate possibilities—La Niña, El Niño, and neutral—forecasts say that neutral conditions are the most likely for the July-September season (tall gray bar above the JAS label, over 80 percent chance). By the September-November (SON) season, La Niña has the highest chance of occurring (blue bar, above 65 percent chance). NOAA Climate Prediction Center image. All that summer heat can make one forgetful so let’s go back over why we care so much about ENSO. First, a reminder that El Niño and La Niña are opposite phases of ENSO. occurs when the water in the eastern and central tropical Pacific is warmer than average, while La Niña occurs when the water is cooler than average. That change in water temperature can jumble up the causing a The end result is shifts in the and changes in weather patterns, often leading to wild weather including floods, droughts, and heatwaves. But unlike other climate phenomena which can be difficult to predict even two weeks prior, the phase of ENSO many months in advance, giving communities worldwide vital time to prepare. ENSO-Neutral, meanwhile, simply reflects that ocean temperatures are near-average, with little unusual impacts on the atmosphere above it. The last month has seen near-average sea surface temperatures across most of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, so we are squarely ENSO-Neutral. The Niño-3.4 region of the Pacific, which is , was 0.1°C warmer than the long-term average from 1991-2020, according to ERSSTv5, our most reliable Yep, I did say “warmer.” So let’s dive deeper into the Pacific for the reason we are still forecasting the development of La Niña (eventually) this year. While sea surface temperatures are currently perfectly , below-average water temperatures in the subsurface (the surface to 300 meters below the surface) of the tropical Pacific Ocean strengthened in the past month, expanding across more of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. These cooler-than-average waters will be one of the driving forces behind any La Niña that forms later this year. Beneath the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean at the equator, a deep pool of cooler-than-average (blue) waters has been building up throughout the summer to date (June 7-August 1, 2024). This pool of relatively cool water is a key factor behind the prediction for La Niña later this fall and winter. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on analysis from Michelle L'Heureux, Climate Prediction Center. Meanwhile, for as interesting as the ocean has been, the atmosphere has been the opposite. The trade winds were slightly more easterly than normal in July (which reflects slightly stronger-than-average trade winds), while thunderstorm activity was generally near-average. A pretty clear reflection of ENSO-Neutral. Let’s talk about the forecast. So far this summer, the climate models we use for guidance have been trending toward a weaker and delayed development of La Niña than they first hinted in the spring. In May and June, the models forecasted a start during summer. But the most recent forecasts pinpoint early fall as the most likely start time. Regardless, the overall model consensus remains that La Niña will likely form this year and last through the upcoming winter. Line graph showing observed and predicted temperatures (black line) in the key ENSO-monitoring region of the tropical Pacific from winter 2023-24 though winter 2024-25. The gray shading shows the range temperatures predicted by individual models that are part of the North American Multi Model Ensemble (NMME, for short). Most of the shading appears below the dashed blue line by the fall, meaning most models predict that temperature in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific will be cooler than average by at least 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit)—the La Niña threshold. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data provided by Climate Prediction Center. This fact, combined with current observations of cooler-than-average water at depth across the Pacific and slightly enhanced trade winds, give forecasters confidence that even though the transition to La Niña has been slower than initially expected, it’s still likely to form later this year. The burning-hot, must-be-suffering-from-heat-exhaustion-at-this-point elephant in the room continues to be the hot streak Earth has been going through for more than a year (as well as the longer warming trend associated with human-caused climate change). Global ocean temperatures have been record breaking every month for well over a year. And just as we noted some uncertainty on how this would affect the 2023-24 El Niño (RIP), the same goes for any developing La Niña. Daily surface temperatures for the global oceans between 60˚ North and South from 1981-2024 to date. From April of 2023 (orange line) through May 2024 (red line) temperatures were not only been much warmer than the 1981-2010 average (thick blue-green line), but record warm by a wide margin compared to all other years (thin blue-green lines). NOAA Climate.gov image adapted from . Explore NOAA's official monthly rankings with the tool from the National Centers for Environmental Information. This overall heat brings me back to Michelle wrote a few years ago describing the Oceanic Niño Index, which takes the temperature anomaly in the Niño3.4 region and subtracts the anomaly for the entire tropics. This helps to shine a clearer light on the local regions of relative warming or cooling across the Pacific, which is directly tied to increased or decreased tropical rainfall. While it is not , it is a newer index that the team monitors on the side. Said more simply, it’s not how much warmer or colder than average that part of the tropical Pacific is that jumbles up the tropical atmosphere, it’s the in warming or cooling compared the rest of the Pacific. And that’s where the relative ONI comes in! So where do things stand? The regular ONI for May-July was +0.2°C. But the relative ONI was already down to -0.4°C. That means there could be a scenario later this year where the ONI is not yet below -0.5°C, but the ONI already is, and the atmosphere might start reflecting La Niña-like impacts. Doesn’t that seem like a pain to communicate? Tell me about it! Luckily for me, if that does happen it will be Emily’s job to communicate it all when she’s back writing the monthly outlook posts next month. Sorry, Emily. The NMME plots for August look a lot like the NMME plots for July. Seems on the plots the CFSv2 is the outlier and most of the models are somewhere in between .5 and 1 around .75. Seems the CPC/IRI plots are about the same. The NMME seasonal outlook for winter looks alot like a La Nina seasonal precipitation map where the drier and wetter areas of the US look like. The Temperature outlook is interesting. The chart looks like almost the entire continental US will experience above average temperatures during winter according to the NMME. What do you think about all this? Submitted by on Thu, 08/08/2024 - 15:18 Most models still have La Nina forming so it makes sense that the precipitation signal for winter reflects La Nina-like conditions. Climate models tend to latch onto that signal as it's the most predictable at this early a stage. As for temperature, NMME still shows a colder than average signal across Canada for DJF and generally around average for the northern tier, so that signal is still there just not pushed as far south. Submitted by on Mon, 08/12/2024 - 21:48 In reply to by Thanks Tom! if the dreaded La Nina winter pattern develops with the NP high which keeps California high and dry I would think that would result in the jet stream dropping cold arctic air into the midwest during the winter months. We are hoping not to experience one of the bone dry patterns during winter, Submitted by on Thu, 08/15/2024 - 12:56 In reply to by If this La Niña is a late-blooming one where it isn’t officially declared until February or March of 2025, this will be very much like the 2005-2006 Season’s Weak La Niña, and the La Niña wasn’t officially declared until February 2006. Submitted by on Sat, 08/10/2024 - 20:23 We won't have to wait that long to declare the event here. We'll declare La Nina present before it qualifies using the official metric of 5 consecutive 3-month seasons.

The subsurface is so cold that the pent up cold water now could mean a late-show 2024-2025 La Niña that stalled in June, but rebounds and shows up in February-March 2025 could give 2025-2026 Super La Niña a head start Submitted by on Sat, 08/10/2024 - 20:27 Hopefully, of them La Nina a head start in 2029-2030, After 2 years of Neutral of 2027-28, and 2025-26, After 3 years of El Nino of 2026/27, was start dry Jan 2027, with no rain in Los Angeles.

Will this year to end with El niño? Submitted by on Mon, 08/12/2024 - 22:36 Australia has a different threshold for La Nina. Their threshold I believe is -.8. CFS seems to be the outlier but most of the models still show a La Nina occurring but a weak one. If you read the update above, they still project a La Nina most likely occurring during winter. Submitted by on Thu, 08/15/2024 - 12:53 In reply to by I have also heard that ocean temperatures had set records every month for over a year (though I've heard that, last month, they were \"only\" the second-hottest ever recorded for a July). And, according to the graph, it looks like the ones for 2023 and this year have been a bit less than half a degree celsius higher than the previous range had been. So, have there have been previous years where there was this much of a temperature anomaly compared to other years? If so, what impact did that have on ENSO?

I would think that La Nina is already present and is reacting with the atmosphere ? Submitted by on Fri, 08/23/2024 - 18:20 The PDO is different from ENSO ( ).... while it can be monitored monthly/seasonal, it really is supposed to be an indicator for decadal (10 years or more) fluctuations. The PDO focus is also in the North Pacific Ocean, while ENSO is tropical. That the PDO is negative doesn't mean that ENSO will be too. Submitted by on Mon, 08/26/2024 - 12:00 In reply to by"

        "content": "The Greenland Ice Sheet contains enough stored water to raise sea level by more than 24 feet (7.2 meters) as it melts. How fast that will occur is one of the big unknowns for predicting the pace of sea level rise over the rest of the century. Glacier experts think the ice sheet was likely in balance in the decades leading up to 1990, but since then, it has been losing mass at an accelerating pace. Adapted from the 2019 Arctic Report Card, this graph shows month-to-month changes in Greenland ice mass from April 2002–April 2019 overlaid on a NASA satellite image of the northwest coast of the island (rotated counterclockwise about 90 degrees) from July 19, 2019. Each peak in the graph shows the snow mass gained during the winter; each valley shows summer losses through surface melting and glacier thinning and retreat. The 17-year trend is estimated to be -267±3 billion tons per year, which is enough to have raised sea level by nearly 12 millimeters (0.5 inches). In the satellite image, sapphire blue melt ponds and streams are visible along the low elevations of the ice sheet margin which appears gray where snow has melted and is exposed. Surface melting in summer 2019 was unusually widespread and early, according to the Arctic Report Card, starting in mid-April, 6-8 weeks sooner than average. Under high pressure and sunny skies, roughly 95 percent of the surface experienced melting at some point in the summer, well above the 1981-2010 average of about 64 percent, equivalent to the previous record set in 2012. The highest one-day melt extent was 60.9 percent on July 31. Around the northern margin of the island, the melt season lasted at least 20 days longer than average. Based on combining observations and models since 1948, the exceptionally early and widespread melt in 2019 is likely to have led to the biggest one-year ice mass loss on record for the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Warm water fishes are driving polar species out of the Barents Sea. A toxic algal bloom in the Northwest Pacific was the largest in at least the past 15 years. Each year the annual report examines the physical changes happening to our climate system. One of the main reasons we monitor these changes is because they can affect life on Earth—plants, animals, and us. Populations of Adélie Penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula are crashing due to warming and sea ice loss in the Bellinghausen Sea. Photo by . Used under a . Changes in the physical climate system have cascading effects on the surrounding environment and those that dwell there. The effects may be temporary or permanent. While impacts are happening around the world, the most dramatic are occurring in areas where climate change is happening more quickly or in places where some combination of natural variability and climate change may have collided to produce extreme warmth. In the 2015 edition of the report, climate and biology experts wrote about some dramatic impacts of warming on life in the ocean. In the western Antarctic Peninsula region of the Bellinghausen Sea, temperatures are rapidly warming, and changes in the marine ecosystem are underway. There, food webs are generally supported by algae. Algae feed large swarms of Antarctic krill, which are the main food for large predators, including the region’s Adélie penguins. Algal blooms, krill, and Adélie penguins are all dependent on how much seasonal sea ice there is and when it begins to melt in the spring. Populations of Adélie Penguins (bright blue line) have crashed as sea ice in their habitat disappears. Population of the warm-adapted Gentoo penguin (dark blue line) are climbing. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from Figure SB6.2 in Since the early 1990s, mainly due to the decreasing seasonal sea ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, the population of the native Adélie penguin has catastrophically declined. On the other hand, Gentoo penguins– an invasive species from warmer regions – can more readily handle changes in seasonal sea ice. The first Gentoo breeding pairs were observed in this region in 1994, and their population has increased dramatically as the seasonal sea ice cover has declined and water temperatures have increased. Meanwhile, in the Northern Hemisphere, Arctic air temperatures are warming twice as fast as lower latitudes. As if to remind us of this fact, 2015 tied as the warmest year on record for the region, and sea ice reached its fourth lowest extent. When air temperatures rise and sea ice melts, the impacts may be widespread and sometimes permanent. Walruses provide a stark example. These animals mate along ice edges in the drifting pack ice during winter and give birth on sea ice in spring. They use sea ice to rest, or “haul out” of the water, if it is close to where they hunt for food. Thousands of walruses hauled out on a barrier island offshore of Alaska’s northern coast in late summer 2014. Photo by Corey Accardo, NOAA/NMFS. Decreasing summer ice in the Bering and Chukchi Seas is leading females and their calves to rest on the shoreline, which has resulted in many calf fatalities due to overcrowding and trampling. Walruses may also have to travel longer distances, as much as 110 miles one way, to hunt for food. And it’s not just sea ice decline impacting the walruses. Other factors connected to climate change, such as increased shipping and development, increased disease, and ocean acidification impacts, will also likely play a role in the future of these mammals. The Arctic oceans are experiencing incredible warmth as well. Average surface temperatures in ice-free regions in August 2015 were up to 14 degrees F above average in several regions. As oceans warm, several fish species in the Northern Hemisphere are moving from their native areas northward into cooler waters. In the span of a decade, warm water fish species from the North Atlantic have pushed Arctic species out of the Barents Sea. NOAA Climate.gov images based on originals by Maria Fossheim. Warmer-water fish, such as North Atlantic cod, beaked redfish, and long rough dab, have moved into northern parts of the Barents Sea, pushing out local Arctic fish. These newcomers can handle a wide range of habitats and feed on diverse prey, making them more likely to thrive in a changing environment than the native species. North Atlantic cod—the most important commercial species—has not been this abundant since the 1950s. The larger fish from the south will compete with the smaller Arctic species for food, and even prey on them directly. As new competitors and predators arrive, even the most abundant Arctic species in the northern Barents Sea, the local Polar cod, could become extinct. The Arctic marine food web may change as well, causing ecological impacts to spread more quickly. Farther south, in the northeast Pacific, of algae stretched off the North American coast from southern California to British Columbia during spring and summer 2015. These harmful algal blooms can occur annually in the region, but significant impacts are typically are more localized compared to the simultaneous and widespread effects that lasted into 2016. produces a neurotoxin called domoic acid, which can build up in shellfish, other invertebrates, and fish. This can lead to illness and death in a variety of birds and mammals that consume them. This May 22, 2015, photo shows a fin whale calf floating off Marmot Bay in Kodiak Island, Alaska. This calf is one of an unusually large number of whale deaths in the Western Gulf of Alaska since May. Photo by Rob Baer, Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The 2015 bloom was the largest in at least the past 15 years. Concentrations of domoic acid measured in the algae, released into seawater, and in the bodies of many forage fish and shellfish were among the highest ever reported for this region. By mid-May, domoic acid concentrations in Monterey Bay, California, were 10 to 30 times the amount considered “high” for a normal bloom. Climate and biology experts think that unusually warm surface waters in the region, which have been in place since 2013, contributed to the severity and early onset of the bloom.

        "meta_description": "Climate outlooks are different from weather forecasts, and it's easy to misunderstand what the maps are telling us. Let us explain.",
        "content": "On the third Thursday of every month, NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center issues an for the United States for the coming month. These climate outlooks are updated on the last day of each month. Those updated outlooks are the basis for the posts that appear on Climate.gov each month. are released around the middle of each month. NOAA’s monthly and seasonal climate outlooks do not predict the actual temperature or precipitation amounts for upcoming months or seasons. Instead, they predict the probability (percent chance) that upcoming monthly or seasonal average temperature or precipitation will fall in the top third, middle third, or bottom third of the climate record at a given place. Currently, the climate record spans 1991-2020. For simplicity, we refer to those categories as , or mal. The colors on the outlook maps show which of the three is most likely. NOAA’s temperature outlook for the 3-month “season” of February–April 2024 showing which temperature outcome was forecast as most likely in different parts of the country—orange and red for well above normal, blues for well below normal, and gray for near normal. The darker the color, the higher the chances of that outcome, not the bigger the departure from normal. White areas mean that any of the three outcomes was equally likely. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data form the Climate Prediction Center. The darker the color, the higher the chances of that category, the bigger the departure from normal. In the map above, the darker orange in the Pacific Northwest or Alaska does not mean temperatures there were predicted to be farther above average than temperatures in the Great Lakes region. The size of the predicted temperature anomaly ( means \"difference from average\") in each place was the same: in the upper third of the local temperatures recorded for all February–April periods in the 1991–2020 climate record. Instead, the darker colors mean the odds of that happening in Washington, Oregon, or interior Alaska were higher (50-60% chance) than in the Great Lakes Region (40-50% chance). White areas on the maps mean \"equal chances\". In those areas, forecasters think that any of the three possible temperature or precipitation outcomes—well above, well below, or near normal—are equally likely. Sometimes an \"equal chances\" forecast means that there are no strong influences in the climate system that would favor one outcome over another, so forecasters default to the average climatological frequency (33.3 percent chance each). Other times it means that there are competing influences, and forecasters can't say which is more likely to win out. In the real world, the probability for a single category will never be 100 percent. We will never be able to say a month in advance that there is a 100 percent chance of a wetter-than-average May, for instance. The climate is not that predictable. There's always a chance one of the other outcomes sneaks in there. A complete climate outlook, then, is three forecasts rolled into one: the probability of well above normal temperature or precipitation, the probability of well below normal temperature or precipitation, and the probability of near-normal temperature or precipitation. (left of slider) An outlook map uses color coding to show the outcome forecasters think is most likely for the upcoming month or season. (right of slider) Even when one outcome is favored, however, the full forecast shows the other outcomes remain possible. The possibility of negative outcomes means those using forecasts that use probability have to carefully balance risk and reward. NOAA Climate.gov images, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center. Outlook maps show which climate outcome is favored and by how much. To determine the odds of the less likely climate outcomes, forecasters subtract the highest probability from 100 percent and divide the remainder between the other two categories. If the highest probability category is \"near normal,\" then the remaining probability is split evenly between the \"well above normal\" and \"well below normal\" categories. If forecasters think there is a 40 percent chance of near-normal temperature in the Pacific Northwest for the coming month, that leaves 60 percent chance (100 minus 40) to be split evenly between the less likely outcomes: 30 percent chance of much cooler than normal and 30 percent chance of much warmer than normal. Diagram of the probabilities of the less-likely temperature outcomes when the most likely outcome is near-normal temperatures. The chances of near-normal temperatures are subtracted from 100 and the remainder is split evenly between the above- and below-normal outcomes. NOAA Climate.gov, adapted from Climate Prediction Center . If the highest probability outcome is well above or below normal, the math for splitting up the remaining odds is a little more complicated. Physically speaking, it makes sense that if the odds have tilted one climate extreme by a given percent, they’ve tilted from the opposite extreme outcome by an equal amount. So by convention, forecasters divvy up the remaining probability by holding the chances for near-normal conditions at the climatological average of 33.3 percent, and then subtracting that from the total remainder. What’s left is the probability of the least-favored category. For example, if the outlook says there is a 40 percent chance of much warmer than normal October in the Southwest, the remaining 60 percent chance would be split unevenly. Near normal would be given the default climatological probability of 33.3 percent, leaving a 26.7 percent chance (60 minus 33.3) of a much cooler than average October. The diagram below shows how each map category breaks down into a full climate forecast. A full monthly temperature outlook is made up of three probabilities: the chances for a warmer-than-average month (yellow to red colors), the chances of a near-average month (gray), and the chances of a cooler-than-average month (blue colors). As the chances of one outcome increase, the chances of the opposite outcome decrease—but never all the way to zero. NOAA Climate.gov graphic, adapted from Climate Prediction Center histogram. If you proceed on this way for higher probabilities of above- or below-normal outcomes, you would eventually reach a point where once you've subtracted from 100 and then given 33.3 percent to the near-normal category, there would be zero or negative percent chance left over for the opposite outcome. Because there is always some degree of uncertainty in any climate forecast, forecasters know it would not be realistic to say there is zero percent chance of a given outcome, any more than they would say there was a 100 percent chance. So even when the climate seems tipped very strongly toward a given outcome, forecasters never set the probability of the less likely outcomes below 3.3 percent. When one outcome is strongly favored, forecasters set a minimum 3.3 percent chance for the opposite outcome and place the remainder of the balance on a near-normal outcome. For example, if an outlook said the chance of a much warmer than average winter was 80 percent, then the chance of a much colder than average winter would be 3.3 percent, and the chance for a near-normal winter would be 16.7 percent (100 minus 80 minus 3.3). In ski season roulette, a climate outlook will never completely crush a skier's hopes. Even for a hypothetical forecast for an 80% chance of a warmer-than-average winter, forecasters leave at least a small chance—by convention NOAA forecasters say 3.3%—that a cold winter will happen. And of course, a single big snow event can sometimes save an otherwise poor season. NOAA Climate.gov cartoon.

        "meta_description": "One strategy for combating climate change is to enhance natural processes and/or deploy new technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the air and ocean.",
        "content": "The increase of CO in the atmosphere has led to warming of surface temperatures over land and in the global oceans, ocean waters becoming more acidic and lower in oxygen, changes in marine food webs, and other associated climate impacts. Long-term protection of Earth’s climate and oceans requires substantial reductions in . (2nd Edition, 2024) estimates that 7–9 gigatonnes (Gt) CO removal will be required each year by 2050 to achieve the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. ~2 GtCO removal per year is already occurring, primarily through conventional CDR methods. Conventional methods are those that are already well established and part of land-use change or forestry activities (e.g., reforestation/afforestation, wetland restoration, soil carbon). Emerging, or “novel”, CDR methods currently contribute only 0.0013 GtCO removal per year, but are growing at a more rapid rate. To reach the 2050 goal, a large-scale increase in the capacity of novel CDR pathways is required. If this is achieved, the total CDR carbon sinks would be comparable to the size of the natural land and ocean carbon sinks ( ). The global carbon budget for 2022 showing the approximate size of CO2 emissions sources and natural sinks compared to the projected size of the CDR sink for 2050 and 2100 needed to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement (values from Friedlingstein et al., 2022 and Minx et al., 2018). There has been a substantial increase in investment in research and development of CDR methods from national governments, private industry, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These early investments are essential if CDR is to be implemented at large scale. Novel CDR pathways are currently in their infancy and all approaches require additional research and development. If scaled, a successful CDR strategy would need to be appropriately balanced with other to ensure responsible, permanent carbon removal. CDR methods can be divided into two main categories: land-based approaches and ocean-based approaches (also called marine CDR or mCDR), as illustrated in Schematic illustrating land-based and marine CDR approaches. Land-based approaches involve changes to agriculture, forests, and other land-use activities, as well as of CO . DAC describes a number of processes that remove CO from the air with a liquid or solid adsorbent and then store the carbon in under- ground reservoirs. Other land-based CDR approaches include of natural carbonate and silicate rocks, methods for increasing soil carbon uptake (e.g., agricultural sequestration), and storage in above- ground biomass (e.g., ). Biomass/crop residues can be converted into a more stable form of carbon, known as , which can be stored long-term in soils or underground. Marine CDR approaches can amplify the ocean’s natural carbon cycles that pull carbon from the atmosphere and transport it into the deep ocean. , which increases the ocean’s drawdown of CO by lowering surface water acidity, has the potential added benefit of mitigating . Other methods include (nutrient addition), and to encourage phytoplankton growth and export. Alternatively, engineered approaches can strip CO from seawater in a process known as . Activities that enhance typically focus on restoration and/or conservation of naturally occurring ecosystems, but may also provide local to regional carbon removal. When these methods are carefully carried out alongside appropriate monitoring, report- ing, and verification (MRV), they can be considered CDR. A coastal blue carbon project may be considered a land- or ocean-based approach depending on the methodology (e.g. mangroves vs seagrass projects). To be considered CDR, CO must be directly removed from the atmosphere, converted to long-duration (100–1000 years) storage products, and result in negative emissions for the overall process. Therefore, CDR approaches and their environmental impacts would need a robust system for MRV to meet these standards. The development of an MRV system is critical for accurately tracking and providing accountability metrics for carbon removal. CDR methods are evaluated on several metrics: scalability, durability and duration of storage, energy requirements, economic feasibility, and environmental impacts. A fundamental challenge of CDR is achieving the enormous scale of required carbon removal on a suitably rapid timescale with minimal impact on the environment and marine habitats (such as from mining, acid production, waste products, etc.). Scalability refers both to how quickly CDR projects can be replicated, given space, time, and cost constraints, and to the theoretical cap on the total potential carbon removal. CO has a lifetime in the atmosphere and oceans of 1000s of years. It is imperative that carbon reservoirs are sustainable over long periods with minimal leakage back into the atmosphere. Temporary reservoirs, such as plants and trees, return CO to the atmosphere when they die or are destroyed (e.g., by wildfire). Conversely, geologic carbon storage in the form of dissolved CO or solid carbonates (rock) in deep sea sediments is an effectively permanent (>1000 years) removal. For CDR methods to be carbon negative, the energy required to drive the system, to mine or engineer the materials needed to convert CO to a more durable form, and to transport and store the carbon, must come from renewable or non-CO emitting sources. A key challenge for DAC and DOR systems is the necessary high-energy inputs. The cost of CDR methods is determined by the cost-per-ton of carbon removed. Some techniques, such as DAC, currently have a high cost due to the infrastructure and materials required. The development of a carbon management industry could have widespread economic benefits, with estimates of 300,000 new jobs by 2050 and an overall industry valuation of US $259B by 2050. Large-scale CDR actions may have a variety of co-benefits and unintended negative side effects. Co-benefits of CDR include potential mitigation of ocean acidification and improvements to coastal wetlands, forests, and soils that would promote biodiversity, environmental sustainability, and crop/food production. A primary concern of CDR is managing the extremely large waste flows (stored carbon) that would need to be safely deposited and stored for hundreds to thousands of years. The side effects of mCDR techniques on ocean ecosystems are also not fully understood and could include depletion of subsurface oxygen, changes in ocean biogeochemistry and habitat, shifts in marine food webs, and other unintended consequences for ocean life. Given the novelty of this field, the regulatory landscape for permitting and environmental protection is still being developed. Given NOAA’s ocean regulatory authority, NOAA is with other Federal agencies and stakeholders on . Codes of conduct are beginning to emerge for CDR and mCDR research and/or implementation, but are not binding. International agreements, such as the London Convention and London Protocol covering marine pollution, are actively considering whether to incorporate more mCDR strategies into their framework. , suggesting that well-resourced, community-driven decision making, equitable distribution of deployment and employment, geopolitical responsibility sharing, development of a diverse scientific workforce, and transparent technology transfer will be essential to inform deployment strategies and safeguard against past, present, and future harms for marginalized communities. Accordingly, researching how CDR techniques may change the climate system are already part of NOAA’s purview. Assessing the effectiveness and safety of CDR approaches is directly related to NOAA’s mission to study linkages between the ocean and atmosphere. NOAA’s existing and innovative assets can inform evidence-based decisions on implementation of CDR techniques by federal and state agencies, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations. NOAA’s mission also includes the stewardship of environmental resources (e.g., fisheries and aquaculture, coastal wetlands, protected/endangered species, and marine sanctuaries) that may be affected, both positively and negatively, by CDR. in areas such as seafood production, protected species conservation and recovery, marine ecosystem structure and function, and coastal communities will play a role in mCDR research and implementation permitting.

        "meta_description": "The highest odds for a much warmer than normal and much drier than normal October are across the western and central parts of the country.",
        "content": "Other than copious amounts of rainfall associated with Hurricane Helene in the Southeast, September was generally another dry month across much of the nation. As such, drought across the country increased again last month. Temperatures during September were mixed with much above-normal temperatures across the Northern Plains, but normal to even below-normal temperatures across parts of the Southeast and Eastern U.S. With over 70% of the nation at least abnormally dry, will October be another drier-than-normal month, adding to further expansion of drought? And as we head closer to winter, will the mild temperatures of September continue? Let’s see what NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) predicts for October. The U.S. temperature outlook for October 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for October or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean , not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average October. or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average October temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. On September 30, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for October 2024. The temperature outlook favors well above across the central and western parts of the nation, as well as around the Great Lakes and Northeast. The precipitation outlook favors well below across much of the central and western parts of the country, with above-average precipitation only favored along the South Atlantic Coast and in Florida. The precipitation outlook for October 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean , not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average October. or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total October precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. I’ll also provide more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, as well as discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during September, and the drought outlook for October. Finally, remember that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the outcome, and that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found . The updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC’s own 6-10 day, Week 2, and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), and the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. Since we’re still it did not play a role in the October outlooks. And while the has been active recently the current response in the mid-latitudes has not been consistent with the overwhelming majority of the medium and extended range guidance, so it did not play a significant role in the outlooks. The October temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across all of the central and western parts of the nation, in northern Alaska, in southern Florida, around the Great Lakes, and in the Northeast. ( means “in the warmest third of all Octobers in the recent climate record.”) E odds (chance of below-, near-, and above-average) were found in the remainder of the country. The best odds for a warmer-than-average October are centered over the Four Corners region, where probabilities exceed 70%. Almost all of the western and west-central parts of the nation have probabilities exceeding 50%, as temperatures are favored to be above-average in all CPC outlooks for much of this region (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4). And October is already forecast to begin warm with temperatures expected to be more than 10°F above average, according to forecasts by the WPC. Forecast ridging (jet stream shifted north of normal) is consistently forecast during all time scales for the western part of the nation, consistent with the outlooks. Throughout the Southeast and Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, weak troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) in response to the western ridging introduces a high degree of uncertainty. The CPC mid-range guidance favors near-average temperatures and the longer-range guidance (Week 3-4) has an equal chance forecast. The precipitation outlook for October favors below-average rainfall across large parts of the country, with the largest odds (greater than 50%) found in the southern and central Plains. The aforementioned predicted ridging over the West supports the large area favored to have another drier-than-average month. Below-normal rainfall is also favored in the short-, medium-, and longer-range outlooks. Above-average rainfall is only favored for southern Alaska and the extreme Southeast including Florida, where the month is expected to begin quite wet. All of CPC’s outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4) also have some tilt in the odds toward wetter-than-average conditions here. Drought conditions across the contiguous United States as of September 24, 2024. Pockets of extreme (red) and exceptional (dark red) drought were present in Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Ohio, and West Virginia. A fairly large area of the lower 48 was at least abnormally dry (yellow). This map was produced prior to the arrival of extreme rainfall associated with Hurricane Helene across the Southeast at the end of September. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by the . With another mostly dry month in the books, the amount of drought across the continuous United States continued to increase during September. Drought increased from almost 28% at the beginning of the month to over 34% at the end with another 38% of the nation classified as abnormally dry, potentially setting the state for further drought development. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing and drought) also increased during the month to just over 3%, although that continues to remain fairly low by historical standards. Regionally, most of the significant increase in drought was concentrated in the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, with much of this region recording 2-3 class changes. The drought monitor shown here was finalized prior to the rainfall from Hurricane Helene, so improvements in these regions will appear in the next Drought Monitor. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, the southern, central and northern Plains (up to 2 class changes), and in the Northeast. In contrast, some drought improvement was observed in parts of the Northwest and across parts of the South, with the largest improvement occurring in central Texas (2-3 classes, with some removal). U.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in October 2024. Several new areas of drought are likely to develop (yellow) across the central states. Existing drought in those areas and in portions of the West, and Ohio Valley are likely to continue or worsen (brown). Existing drought in the Central and Southern Appalachians is expected to improve by at least 1 category (tan) or end (green). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See for Alaska and Hawaii. Drought persistence during October is likely for large parts of the central and western U.S., with above-average temperatures and below-average rainfall favored for most of these regions. Drought development is also predicted across parts of the Plains, mainly in regions with significant 90-day precipitation deficits and declining soil moisture. Although the precipitation outlook also depicts increased odds for below-normal rainfall out West, no large-scale development is anticipated since drought development tends to be slower in this region, during what is typically a dry month. In contrast, heavy to excessive rainfall associated with Hurricane Helene and its remnants will lead to drought improvement or removal across parts of the Southeast and in the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys. However, drought is predicted to persist in the northern part of the Ohio Valley, as rainfall amounts from Helene’s remnants were less than 2 inches and October is slightly favored to be drier-than-average.

The increase between the year 1800 and today is 70% larger than the increase that occurred when Earth climbed out of the last ice age between 17,500 and 11,500 years ago, and it occurred 100-200 times faster. In addition, fossil fuels are the only source of carbon consistent with the of the carbon present in today’s atmosphere. That analysis indicates it must be coming from terrestrial plant matter, and it must be very, very old. These and other lines of evidence leave no doubt that fossil fuels are the primary source of the carbon dioxide building up in Earth’s atmosphere. Large machines loading coal into train cars. Licensed Adobe Stock photo. During all of the cycles between ice ages and warm periods over the past million years, atmospheric carbon dioxide never climbed higher than 300 parts per million. At the end of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago, it was 280 ppm. Today it is . The increase between the year 1800 and today is 70% larger than the increase that occurred when Earth climbed out of the last ice age between 17,500 and 11,500 years ago, and it occurred 100-200 times faster. Only fossil fuels—which are the remains of millions of years of carbon uptake by plants—contain enough carbon to produce such a massive change in such a short time. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO in parts per million (ppm) for the past 800,000 years based on ice-core data (light purple line) compared to 2022 concentration (bright purple dot). The peaks and valleys in the line show ice ages (low CO ) and warmer interglacials (higher CO ). Throughout that time, CO was never higher than 300 ppm (light purple dot, between 300,000 and 400,000 years ago). The increase over the last 60 years is 100 times faster than previous natural increases. In fact, on the geologic time scale, the increase from the end of the last ice age to the present (dashed purple line) looks virtually instantaneous. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov based on data from Lüthi, et al., 2008, via NOAA NCEI Paleoclimatology Program. In addition, only fossil fuels are consistent with the of the carbon in today’s atmosphere. Different kinds of carbon-containing material have different relative amounts of “light” carbon-12, “heavy” carbon-13, and radioactive carbon-14. Plant matter is enriched in carbon-12, because its lighter weight is more readily used by plants during photosynthesis. Volcanic emissions are enriched in carbon-13. The ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere and the ocean are roughly the same. Since carbon-14 is radioactive, it decays predictably over time. Young organic matter has more carbon-14 than older organic matter, and fossil fuels have no measurable carbon-14 at all. As carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have risen over the past century or more, the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 has fallen, which means that the source of the extra carbon dioxide must be enriched in \"light\" carbon-12. Meanwhile, the relative amount of carbon-14—radioactive carbon—has declined. The record of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is complicated by nuclear bomb testing after 1950, which doubled the amount of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere. After the nuclear test ban treaty in 1963, the excess atmospheric carbon-14 began to decline as it dispersed into the oceans and the land biosphere. In the last four decades, however, the decline of carbon-14 has been noticeably faster than can be explained by continuing dispersal of the bomb-related carbon-14. This faster decline is driven by the addition to the atmosphere of huge amounts of carbon dioxide from a source with no carbon-14. As this carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, it dilutes the ratio of 14-carbon dioxide (i.e., carbon dioxide containing a carbon-14 atom) to total carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Taken together, then, we are looking for a source of carbon dioxide that comes from terrestrial plants (because they are depleted in \"heavy\" carbon-13), is so old that any carbon-14 it once contained has decayed to non-detectable levels, and is capable of creating a pulse of carbon dioxide that is larger and faster than anything that’s occurred in at least the past million years. Only fossil fuels meet all those criteria. Help us improve our content"

When different teams of climate scientists in different agencies (e.g., NOAA and NASA) and in other countries (e.g., the U.K.’s Hadley Centre) average these data together, they all find essentially the same result: Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by about 1.8°F (1.0°C) since 1880.

The background photo shows a glacier calving front in western Greenland, captured from an airplane during a NASA Operation IceBridge field campaign. We know this warming is largely caused by human activities because the key role that carbon dioxide plays in maintaining Earth’s natural greenhouse effect has been understood since the mid-1800s. Unless it is offset by some equally large cooling influence, more atmospheric carbon dioxide will lead to warmer surface temperatures. Since 1800, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from about 280 parts per million to 410 ppm in 2019. We know from both its rapid increase and its isotopic “fingerprint” that the source of this new carbon dioxide is fossil fuels, and not natural sources like forest fires, volcanoes, or outgassing from the ocean. Philip James de Loutherbourg's 1801 painting, , came to symbolize the start of the Industrial Revolution, when humans began to harness the power of fossil fuels—and to contribute significantly to Earth's atmospheric greenhouse gas composition.

Still, when we step back and look at the big picture, it’s clear the two are tightly connected. ( ) Yearly temperature compared to the twentieth-century average from 1850–2023.

NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). As the graph above shows, both global temperature (colored bars) and atmospheric carbon dioxide (gray line) increased more slowly during the first half of the observational record in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rose by around 20 parts per million over the 7 decades from 1880­–1950, while the temperature increased by an average of 0.04° C per decade. Over the next 7 decades, however, carbon dioxide climbed nearly 100 ppm—5 times as fast! To put those changes in some historical context, the amount of rise in carbon dioxide levels since the late 1950s would naturally, in the context of , have taken somewhere in the range of 5,000 to 20,000 years; we’ve managed to do it in about 60. At the same time, the rate of warming averaged 0.14° C per decade. The rapid rate of temperature rise over such a short period time points to only one thing, and that is the addition of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, into the environment. Within any given decade, however, the temperature bounces around between warm and cool years. The warmest years are usually El Niño years, when the eastern and central tropical Pacific is warmer than average. The coldest years are generally La Niña years, when that same part of the tropical Pacific is cooler than average. On a longer time scale, warm decades are often associated with strongly positive phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and cool decades with strongly negative phases. In general, the warmest year of any decade will be an El Niño year, the coldest a La Niña one. This graph shows annual average surface temperatures (gray bars), grouped by decade, from 1950 to 2021. The warmest and coldest years of each decade are topped with circles: for El Niño-influenced years and for La Niña years. We considered a year El Niño or La Niña \"influenced\" if the December-February was labelled as part of a by NOAA's Climate Prediction Center or if more than half of the months in that year were. By our definition, 1979 did not qualify as El Niño year because El Niño conditions were present for only 3 months late in the year. 1992 was the coldest year of the 1990s despite being an El Niño year because of the cooling influence of the eruption of in 1991. NOAA Climate.gov graph based on from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. And while these natural climate patterns—through which the ocean alternately accumulates and releases heat—are the most important cause of short-term variations in global surface temperature, other factors occasionally contribute: , , and smoke and other pollution particles. The global ocean buffers Earth’s temperature from rapid change; that to the evolution of complex life on our planet over millions of years. Even with respect to global warming, the ocean’s inertia works in our favor in one way: it provides us with a modest window of time to adapt to and begin to combat climate change before we are forced to confront its full effects on , , and . Like a room's worth of mess stuffed into an overflowing closet, excess heat from carbon dioxide is being hidden in the ocean—thanks to its tremendous heat capacity and volume. NOAA Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh. But there’s a downside to the delayed reaction, too. Like a speeding train, the warming won’t stop the instant we hit the brakes. At whatever point we manage to halt or reverse the trend in greenhouse gases, some additional warming will occur due to the heating imbalance that is already in the pipeline. A from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates how much we could currently expect based on emissions to date: If all anthropogenic [human-caused] emissions...were reduced to zero immediately, any further warming beyond the 1°C already experienced would likely be less than 0.5°C over the next two to three decades ( ), and likely less than 0.5°C on a century time scale ( )…. A warming greater than 1.5°C is therefore not geophysically unavoidable: whether it will occur depends on future rates of emission reductions. Allen, M.R., O.P. Dube, W. Solecki, F. Aragón-Durand, W.

Credit: NOAA Climate Program Office After the 2012 National Forest System Planning Rule directed the USDA Forest Service to begin considering climate change in their land management plans, Forest Service personnel turned to NOAA’s Climate Explorer tool to get projections of future climate conditions. This tool from the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit provides climate projections for every county in the contiguous United States. Working with developers of the open-source Climate Explorer, Forest Service employees from the Forest Service Southern Region, Southern Research Station, and the USDA Southeast Climate Hub requested a version of the tool that would let them access data for specific geographical units. The derivative tool, capable of accessing projection data by ecoregion within National Forest System lands, was dubbed Climate by Forest. Using this first version of Climate by Forest, forest planners could obtain climate change graphs and data files with just a few clicks. However, they still had to perform statistical analyses on the data to test whether projected changes would lead to a significant departure from historical conditions. This second step required days to weeks of a climate specialist’s time to find, process, and reformat a large number of data files. Forest Service personnel, led by then regional climate change coordinator Emrys Treasure, came up with a way to produce summary statistics (including significance and uncertainty tables) for each national forest unit’s ecoregions. Developers incorporated the relevant statistical methods into the tool, enabling managers for every forest unit in the lower 48 states to access projections and the relevant statistical documentation for their plans from Climate by Forest in a matter of minutes.

        "content": "In order to meet future needs for energy, food, and public health, planners and other decision makers need to understand how temperatures are projected to change over the coming decades. As the climate system continues responding to the heat-trapping gases we have added to the atmosphere, temperatures will change at different rates in different regions. Images of projected future climate can help people get a sense of how much warming their region will experience each decade so they can plan ahead for new conditions. This animated gif shows how October average temperatures in the contiguous United States are projected to change in coming decades if global carbon dioxide emissions continue along a high-emissions pathway (known in the climate research community as ). Colors show projected average daily temperature for each month from the 2020s through the 2090s, with blue colors for average monthly temperatures below 60° Fahrenheit, and yellow, orange, and red colors for temperatures warmer than 60°F. The animation starts with an image of the recent past, based on October average temperature from 1981 to 2010 ( ). Over the period, most of the Lower 48 experienced average October temperatures near or below 60°F. Under a continued high-emission scenario, that national pattern flips. By the 2090s, the majority of the contiguous United States will experience average October temperatures above 60°F. To learn about the U.S. impacts of observed and future climate change, read the . This animation was based on maps available in our collection, which includes national maps of projected changes in monthly maximum (daytime high) and minimum (overnight low) temperatures for each month of the year. The collection includes larger versions of these maps, as well as projected temperatures under a lower-emissions pathway. Temperature projections in these images represent output from 32 global climate models that are all part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ( ). To produce regionally relevant projections, results from the global models were statistically downscaled using a method called Localized Constructed Analogs ( ). This technique uses observed local-scale weather and climate information to increase the spatial resolution of global-scale projections, and corrects for bias in the model simulations.

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The occupies about 6 million square miles around Earth's North Pole. Historically, most of the surface of the Arctic Ocean remained ice-covered year round. Around this core of year-round ice was a fringe of seasonal ice that froze each winter and melted each summer. The Arctic ice pack reaches its maximum extent in March, and its minimum extent in September. In September 2022, the area that was at least 15 percent ice covered was 4.87 million square kilometers (1.88 million square miles), tying with 2010 for eleventh lowest in the satellite record. That's 1.54 million square kilometers (595,000 square miles) smaller than the 1981-2010 average—an area larger than Alaska. The smallest daily extent occurred on September 18, when the total ice extent bottomed out for the summer at 4.67 million square kilometers (1.8 million square miles). Arctic sea ice extent for September 19 2023, was 4.23 million square kilometers (1.63 million square miles). It was the sixth smallest summer minimum on record. The orange line shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for that day. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the amount of ice that survives the summer melt season has shrunk by 13 percent per decade relative to the 1981–2010 average. In the , experts reported that the average minimum extent for each third of the satellite record has successively declined: 6.85 million square kilometers (2.64 million square miles) for 1979-1992, 6.13 million square kilometers (2.37 million square miles) for 1993-2006, and 4.44 million square kilometers (1.71 million square miles) for 2007-2020. Just as ponds and lakes in northern states develop a layer of ice on their surfaces during cold winters, the surface of the Arctic Ocean also freezes, forming sea ice. Seawater has a lower freezing point than fresh water, but once it is chilled to around -2°C (about 28°F), the salty liquid begins to solidify. Ice crystals appear on the sea surface, and if the air is cold enough, the crystals expand to form a slushy mix, then a solid covering of ice that can thicken over time. In the Arctic Ocean, the area covered by sea ice grows and shrinks over the course of the year. Each fall, as less sunlight reaches the Arctic and air temperatures begin to drop, additional sea ice forms. The total area covered by ice increases through the winter, usually reaching its maximum extent in early March. Once spring arrives, bringing more sunlight and higher temperatures, the ice begins to melt back, shrinking to its minimum extent each September. Sea ice minimum and maximum extents occur toward the end of summer and the end of winter in part because the ocean lags behind the atmosphere in warming up and cooling down. Sea ice that hasn't yet survived a summer melt season is first-year ice. This thin, new ice is vulnerable to melt and disintegration in stormy conditions. Ice that survives a summer melt season can grow thicker and less salty—two things that make it more resistant to melt. Multiyear ice is more likely to survive temperatures that would melt first-year ice, and to survive waves and winds that would break up first-year ice. Although sea ice moves more slowly than ocean water, ice still moves. Carried by ocean currents, Arctic sea ice regularly flows out toward the warmer waters in the Atlantic via the Fram Strait east of Greenland. Scientists use climate proxies like sediment/ice cores, tree rings, and fossilized shells of ocean creatures to infer sea ice extent far back in time. These paleoclimate records show that while there have been several periods over the past 1,450 years when sea ice extents expanded and contracted, the decrease during the modern era is unrivaled. In the 2017 issue of NOAA’s Arctic Report Card, scientists reported that today's low extent is far lower than anything that's occurred over at least the past 1,500 years. Not only that, but it is well outside the range of natural variability during that period. This time series shows the Arctic sea ice extent in millions of square kilometers over the past roughly 1,500 years. The vertical axis starts at 8, not 0, to better show year-to-year variations. Taken from the 2017 issue of NOAA’s Arctic Report Card, scientists report on a body of paleoclimate research that shows that the extent and rate of sea ice decline in the Arctic is unprecedented over at least the past 1,500 years. Climate.gov image adapted from Figure 3 in “Paleoceanographic Perspectives on Arctic Ocean Change” in the 2017 Arctic Report Card. Original data from Kinnard et al., 2011. Early observations of sea ice coverage in the Arctic come to us both from the oral histories of native populations and from the records of early European mariners who were seeking a \"Northwest Passage\" to the lucrative markets in Asia. Records of sea ice near the coast of Iceland data back to the 9th century, and records became more routine in the 17th century. British and Russian records of sea ice conditions along sailing routes became routine in the 18th and 19th centuries. Detailed shipping charts, available from the United Kingdom Met Office Hadley Centre, show that Arctic sea ice has declined at least since the mid-1950s. Satellite data have documented continued declines; since continuous satellite-based measurements began in November 1978, data show a trend of more ice melting away during summers and less new ice forming during winters. The Beaufort Gyre, a looping current north of Alaska, historically acted as a nursery for young ice, enabling it to thicken and grow. Ice growth in the Beaufort Gyre roughly offset the flow of ice out of the Arctic via the Fram Strait. Since the start of the 20th century, however, summers in the southern portion of the gyre have been too warm for sea ice to survive. Routine observations of Arctic sea ice only began about a decade ago, experts use the age of the ice pack—which has been observed since the 1980s—as a proxy for ice thickness. In mid-March 1985 (left), the winter maximum ice pack was dominated by ice at least 4 years old (white). In 2021 (right), only a small strip of very old ice remained tucked up against the islands of the Canadian Arctic. More than half of the winter ice pack was less than a year old (dark blue). NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. These changes in ice survival mean that even though the sea ice extent at the winter maximum in March has declined more slowly than the extent at summer minimum (2.6 percent per decade in March versus 13 percent per decade in September), the winter ice pack is fundamentally different than it once was. Near the start of the satellite era in the mid-1980s, as much as one-third of the ice cover was made up of thick, multi-year ice. In 2020, it was 5 percent. Percent difference from average sea ice extent in the Arctic at each year's summer minimum in September (bright blue) and winter maximum in March (dark blue) from 1979–2022. Sea ice is declining 5 times more quickly in summer than it is in winter. NOAA Climate.gov image, adapted from Figure 1 in Having so much of the winter ice cover made up of thin, first year ice creates a feedback loop in which the ice is less likely to survive in the summer. It makes the ice pack particularly vulnerable to big, single-year drops during exceptionally warm or stormy summers, drops that the ice pack is unlikely to recover from in the current climate. In addition, the thin ice is more dangerous for native Arctic people who still practice their traditional way of life, which depends on reliably thick ice for hunting and fishing activities. In coastal communities, thin ice also provides far less protection than thick ice from the pounding surf that accompanies fall and winter storms. Arctic sea ice declines are related to the phenomenon known as : more intense warming in the Arctic than over the rest of the globe. fits with current scientific understanding of Earth's climate system, and with model projections of global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Multiple factors contribute to Arctic amplification, and sea ice loss is one of them. Sea ice's white or light gray surface reflects up to 80 percent of incoming sunlight, deflecting additional energy away from the planet. With less ice present, the dark surface of ocean water absorbs considerably more sunlight energy, leading to further warming of the sea surface and overlying atmosphere, which leads to more melting of ice, which leads to more warming, and so on. Scientists are actively studying the effects of this feedback loop to help them understand and predict how decreases in Arctic sea ice and snow cover will affect the global climate system. In the early 20th century, explorer Roald Amundsen took three years (1903–1906) to traverse the Northwest Passage, a route that would allow ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the western Arctic. Although it's not yet a dependable pathway for commercial ships, the Northwest Passage has experienced multiple times since the turn of the 21st century, drawing tourists. Meanwhile, the Northern Sea Route along the coast of Siberia has experienced more consistent ice-free conditions in the summer, which may soon transform it into a reliable shipping route. The opening of shipping lanes across the Arctic may provide shippers with viable alternatives to traveling through the Panama Canal or around the southern tip of South America. This new reality will have impacts not only on the environment, but also on the world economy and national security, as nations compete to gain rights to shipping lanes and newly accessible resources in the Arctic. Responding to oil spills in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean would pose unique challenges. For example, floating booms often used to concentrate oil for burning—as in this field experiment in the Barents Sea—must be strong enough to handle increased drag from ice floes. Photo courtesy Loss of sea ice means lost habitat for marine mammals like polar bears, walruses, and seals, along with disruptions to the food supply of Arctic communities who depend on them. A longer ice-free season exposes Arctic communities to extreme erosion from pounding waves during winter storms. Loss of reflective sea ice and the associated ocean warming are also changing the abundance and range of commercially important high latitude fish species. In addition, in the 2021 Arctic Report Card, scientists reported on two new disturbances related to an increasingly long ice-free season: more underwater noise and more trash from fishing vessels. .

        "content": "A blog about monitoring and forecasting El Niño, La Niña, and their regional and global impacts...but sometimes about other climate phenomena that influence seasonal climate. The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA ), with periodic guest contributors. Ideas and explanations found in these posts should be attributed to the ENSO blog team, and not to NOAA (the agency) itself. These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. The articles posted on this blog have described ENSO, its regional and global impacts, and the challenge of forecasting it, among several other topics. Here we introduce another important player on the tropical stage: the or While the MJO is a lesser-known phenomenon, it can have dramatic impacts in the mid-latitudes. Several times a year the MJO is a strong contributor to various extreme events in the United States, including Arctic air outbreaks during the winter months across the central and eastern portions of the United States. Imagine ENSO as a person riding a exercise bike in the middle of a stage all day long. His unchanging location is associated with the persistent changes in and winds that we have as being linked to ENSO. Now imagine another bike rider entering the stage on the left and pedaling slowly across the stage, passing the stationary bike (ENSO), and exiting the stage at the right. This bike rider we will call the MJO and he/she may cross the stage from left to right several times during the show. So, unlike ENSO, which is stationary, the MJO is an disturbance of clouds, rainfall, winds, and pressure that traverses the planet in the tropics and returns to its initial starting point in 30 to 60 days, on average. This atmospheric disturbance is distinct from ENSO, which once established, is associated with persistent features that last several seasons or longer over the Pacific Ocean basin. There can be multiple MJO events within a season, and so the MJO is best described as tropical climate variability (i.e. varies on a week-to-week basis). The MJO was first discovered in the early 1970s by Dr. Roland Madden and Dr. Paul Julian when they were studying tropical wind and pressure patterns. They often noticed regular oscillations in winds (as defined from departures from average) between Singapore and Canton Island in the west central equatorial Pacific (Madden and Julian, 1971; 1972; Zhang, 2005). The MJO consists of two parts, or : one is the enhanced rainfall (or ) phase and the other is the suppressed rainfall phase. Strong MJO activity often dissects the planet into halves: one half within the enhanced convective phase and the other half in the suppressed convective phase. These two phases produce opposite changes in clouds and rainfall and this entire (i.e., having two main opposing centers of action) propagates eastward. The location of the convective phases are often grouped into geographically based stages that climate scientists number 1-8 as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Difference from average rainfall for all MJO events from 1979-2012 for November-March for the eight phases described in the text. The green shading denotes above-average rainfall, and the brown shading shows below-average rainfall. To first order, the green shading areas correspond to the extent of the enhanced convective phase of the MJO and the brown shading areas correspond to the extent of the suppressed convective phase of the MJO. Note eastward shifting of shaded areas with each successive numbered phase as you view the figure from top to bottom. For the MJO to be considered active, this dipole of enhanced/suppressed convective phases must be present and shifting eastward with time. An animated illustration that depicts the global scale and eastward propagation of these two phases of the MJO is shown here (Fig. 2: animation). Figure 2. An animation illustrating the organization of the MJO into its enhanced and suppressed convective phases during an MJO event during the spring of 2005. The green shading denotes conditions favorable for large-scale enhanced rainfall, and the brown shading shows conditions unfavorable for rainfall. The MJO becomes organized during late March through May as the green shading covers one half of the planet, and brown shades the other half all along as these areas move west to east with time. Notice how the shading returns to the same location on the order of about 45 days. Let’s dig a little deeper and look at some of the characteristics within these two convective phases (Figure 3). In the enhanced convective phase, winds at the surface converge, and air is pushed up throughout the atmosphere. At the top of the atmosphere, the winds reverse (i.e., diverge). Such rising air motion in the atmosphere tends to increase condensation and rainfall. The surface and upper-atmosphere structure of the MJO for a period when the enhanced convective phase (thunderstorm cloud) is centered across the Indian Ocean and the suppressed convective phase is centered over the west-central Pacific Ocean. Horizontal arrows pointing left represent wind departures from average that are easterly, and arrows pointing right represent wind departures from average that are westerly. The entire system shifts eastward over time, eventually circling the globe and returning to its point of origin. Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. In the suppressed convective phase, winds converge at the top of the atmosphere, forcing air to sink and, later, to diverge at the surface (Rui and Wang, 1990). As air sinks from high altitudes, it warms and dries, which suppresses rainfall. It is this entire dipole structure, illustrated in Figure 3, that moves west to east with time in the Tropics, causing more cloudiness, rainfall, and even storminess in the enhanced convective phase, and more sunshine and dryness in the suppressed convective phase. The changes in rainfall and winds described above impact both the Tropics and the Extratropics, which makes the MJO important for extended-range weather and climate prediction over the U.S. and many other areas. The MJO can modulate the timing and strength of monsoons (e.g., Jones and Carvalho, 2002; Lavender and Matthews, 2009), influence tropical cyclone numbers and strength in nearly all ocean basins (e.g., Maloney and Hartmann, 2000), and result in jet stream changes that can lead to cold air outbreaks, extreme heat events, and flooding rains over the United States and North America (Higgins et al. 2000, Cassou, 2008, Lin et al. 2009, Zhou et al., 2012, Riddle et al., 2013, Johnson et al., 2014). The MJO can produce impacts similar to those of ENSO, but which appear only in weekly averages before changing, rather than persisting and therefore appearing in seasonal averages as is the case for ENSO. Future posts will focus on the details of how we monitor and assess the strength of the MJO, provide details on impacts and the reasons for those impacts, and describe the current state of MJO predictability.

Increases in understanding usually occur incrementally and over fairly long periods of time. It might seem like we are stupid, or are not trying hard enough, but that is not the case. The questions are HARD. There are remaining questions about ENSO that are also very difficult. They are as hard as those about why we still don't have a way of preventing the common cold.

The blob is happening in the northern hemisphere, and has been there for a few months. The MJO effects usually follow the MJO itself, progressing from west to east around the globe, unlike the blob which has been relatively stationary. Also, the MJO effects are more easily observed in the atmosphere than the ocean, because it takes longer for the ocean to respond (especially in terms of its surface and subsurface temperature, which mainly define the blob). While there is an effect on the ocean temperature, especially in the tropics, it is not a very large effect because the influence of the MJO keeps changing too quickly. So, the blob is likely mainly related to something other than the MJO, such as the ENSO condition or even the PDO condition preceding its formation. Or, it may not be obviously related to any familiar phenomena and may be \"its own thing\" to large measure.

The most effective one is strong episodes of surface westerly wind, often referred to as westerly wind bursts (WWB) or westerly wind events (WWE). The strongest, long-lasting and eastward moving equatorial WWE are mostly associated with the MJO. Many observations have shown anomalously strong MJO activities prior to and during the onset of ENSO warm events.

Think of them as almost locations. When the MJO enters those phases, it can mean different impacts on weather/climate across the globe including the US.

Submitted by on Fri, 04/30/2021 - 15:56 In reply to by what is the reason for the eastward propagation of MJO??? Submitted by on Tue, 11/09/2021 - 03:11 The dynamics of the MJO are still not completely understood, so there are a lot details that still need to be worked out. But in general, the eastward propagation relates to how the atmospheric circulation responds to the anomalies of atmospheric convection (the regions of enhanced and suppressed rainfall). Under one framework, the eastward propagation can be understood as a response to the atmospheric Rossby waves forming to the west of the enhanced convection and atmospheric Kelvin waves to the east. The Rossby waves lead to eastward winds while the Kelvin waves lead to westward winds that converge east of the enhanced convection. This converging air rises to the east of the original enhanced convection, leading to new convection and an eastward progression of the whole MJO system.

        "content": "Is the globe warming? Yes, our world is warming at an unusually rapid rate, and this is now the warmest period in the history of modern civilization. Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by 1.8°F (1.0°C) since the late 1800s, an average rate of 0.13° F (0.07° C) per decade. Since 1981, the rate of warming has more than doubled to 0.32°F (0.18°C) per decade. The six warmest years in the 1880–2020 record have all occurred since 2014, while 19 of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2001. With significant reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases, the annual global surface temperature rise this century could be limited to 3.6°F (2°C) or less. Without major reductions in these emissions, the increase in annual average global temperatures relative to preindustrial times could reach 9°F (5°C) or more by the end of this century. Learn more and . Did global warming stop in 1998? No, our world continued warming after 1998. Thanks to natural climate variability, volcanic eruptions, and to a smaller extent, low solar activity, the rate of average global warming from 1998–2013 was slower than it had been over the two preceding decades. Such varations in the rate of warming from decade to decade are common. Meanwhile, excess heat continued to accumulate in the deeper layers of the ocean, contributing to marine heat waves and sea level rise. The slowdown in surface warming was only temporary, however, as the six warmest years in recorded history have all occurred after 2013. Learn more and Can we trust NOAA’s global temperature data record? Yes, we can trust the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) data for three key reasons: Are humans causing or contributing to global warming? Yes, by increasing the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, human activities are amplifying Earth’s natural greenhouse effect. Virtually all climate scientists agree that this increase in heat-trapping gases is the main reason for the 1.8°F (1.0°C) rise in global average temperature since the late nineteenth century. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and various chlorofluorocarbons are all human-emitted . Among these, carbon dioxide is of greatest concern to scientists because it exerts a larger overall warming influence than the . At present, humans are putting an estimated 9.5 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuels, and another 1.5 billion through deforestation and other land cover changes. Of this human-produced carbon, forests and other vegetation absorb around 3.2 billion metric tons per year, while the ocean absorbs about 2.5 billion metric tons per year. A net 5 billion metric tons of human-produced carbon remain in the atmosphere each year, raising the global average carbon dioxide concentrations by about 2.3 parts per million per year. Since 1750, humans have increased the abundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by nearly 50 percent. . What is the difference between and ? Both phrases can have slightly different meanings in different contexts, but these days, generally refers to the long-term increase in global average temperature as a result of human activity. Climate change is a much broader term that covers changes in multiple parts of the climate system, from temperature to precipitation to wind patterns. Climate change can be local, regional, or global, and it can have natural or human causes. Global warming is a type of climate change; however, not all climate change is global warming. . What scientific evidence exists that Earth is warming and that humans are the main cause? We know the world is warming because people have been recording daily high and low temperatures at thousands of weather stations worldwide, over land and ocean, for many decades and, in some locations, for more than a century. When different teams of climate scientists in different agencies (e.g., NOAA and NASA) and in other countries (e.g., the U.K.’s Hadley Centre) average these data together, they all find essentially the same result: Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by about 1.8°F (1.0°C) since 1880. In addition to our surface station data, we have many different lines of evidence that Earth is warming ( ). Birds are migrating earlier, and their migration patterns are changing. and are moving north. Plants are blooming earlier in the spring. Mountain glaciers are melting and snow cover is declining in the Northern Hemisphere (Learn more and ). Greenland’s ice sheet—which holds about 8 percent of Earth’s fresh water—is melting at an accelerating rate ( ). Mean global sea level is rising ( ). Arctic sea ice is declining rapidly in both thickness and extent ( ). We know this warming is largely caused by human activities because the key role that carbon dioxide plays in maintaining Earth’s natural greenhouse effect has been understood since the mid-1800s. Unless it is offset by some equally large cooling influence, more atmospheric carbon dioxide will lead to warmer surface temperatures. Since 1800, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from about 280 parts per million to 410 ppm in 2019. We know from both its rapid increase and its isotopic “fingerprint” that the source of this new carbon dioxide is fossil fuels, and not natural sources like forest fires, volcanoes, or outgassing from the ocean. Finally, no other known climate influences have changed enough to account for the observed warming trend. Taken together, these and other lines of evidence point squarely to human activities as the cause of recent global warming. How do we know the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is caused by humans? The most basic reason is that fossil fuels—the equivalent of millions of years of plant growth—are the only source of carbon dioxide large enough to raise atmospheric carbon dioxide amounts as high and as quickly as they have risen. The increase between the year 1800 and today is 70 percent larger than the increase that occurred when Earth climbed out of the last ice age between 17,500 and 11,500 years ago, and it occurred 100–200 times faster. In addition, fossil fuels are the only source of carbon consistent with the of the carbon present in today’s atmosphere. That analysis indicates it must be coming from terrestrial plant matter, and it must be very, very old. These and other lines of evidence leave no doubt that fossil fuels are the primary source of the carbon dioxide building up in Earth’s atmosphere. Isn’t there a lot of debate and disagreement among climate scientists about global warming? No. By a large majority, climate scientists agree with the following statements: This scientific consensus is clearly summarized in the climate assessment reports of the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. NOAA scientists played lead roles in authoring and editing both sets of reports. Additionally, the United States’ foremost science agencies and organizations have all recognized global warming as a human-caused problem that threatens human and natural systems and, therefore, should be addressed. These agencies and organizations include (but are not limited to) ; the ; the ; the ; the ; the ; the ; the ; the ; and the . What is the difference between weather and climate? is the short-term atmospheric conditions at a given location on a specific day and time. is usually described as the long-term average weather at a given place, but it the range of weather conditions that are possible at a given place, including the types and historical frequency of extreme events that occur there. By analogy, if the outcome of any given at-bat is like the weather, then a baseball player’s career batting average is like the climate. There’s an old saying: “Climate is what you expect; weather is what you get.” Another way to think about the difference between weather and climate is to say that a region’s climate is the background conditions that give rise to a location’s weather events. Because all weather occurs within Earth’s climate system, changes in the background state of the climate system can make different weather outcomes more or less likely to happen. For example, during the period from 1997-2018, the percentage area of the globe that experienced record-setting warm temperatures dwarfed the percentage area of the globe that experienced record-setting cold temperatures. This was a predictable set of weather outcomes due to global warming. . Why should I trust scientists’ climate projections for 50 or 100 years from now when they can’t accurately forecast the weather more than 2 weeks from now? In many ways, it is actually harder to forecast weather 2 weeks in advance than it is to forecast climate decades in advance because weather is about the conditions and climate is about conditions. Climate models are not trying, for example, to forecast the daytime high temperature in Chicago, IL, on August 15, 2035. They are trying to forecast the daytime high temperature for the of August over the entire of the 2030s. And while the exact weather conditions at a given location can change dramatically from hour to hour, the average changes much less from year to year or even decade to decade. The difference in time scale means that our ability to predict future climate doesn’t depend on our ability to predict next week’s weather. Not only are weather models predicting different things than climate models, they require different kinds of starting information. Modelers call weather forecasting an problem because, at short time scales, the future atmospheric conditions depend mostly on the initial atmospheric conditions. The accuracy of your forecast for a given location depends heavily on how well you can describe these initial conditions, especially in the surrounding area. In contrast, most modelers describe a climate projection as a problem because at long time scales (years to decades), future climate depends mostly on big-picture characteristics of the Earth system that don’t vary from day to day: the amount of land and ocean surface, the height and location of mountain ranges, the geometry of Earth’s orbit, and—crucially—the composition of the global atmosphere. These things define the boundaries of the climate system, the relatively narrow range of outcomes that are possible over long time frames. These fundamental differences between weather models and climate models, in both what they are trying to predict and what those predictions depend on, mean that the quality of a weather forecast two weeks out isn’t a good test of how well we can predict the climate two decades out. How do greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming? Different gases interact with light and heat energy in different ways. The chemical structure of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane, allows them to absorb some of the heat energy radiated from Earth’s surface. They re-radiate some of it back toward the surface, like the bricks in a chimney radiate warmth back into a room even after a fire goes out. This behavior is the foundation of Earth’s natural greenhouse effect, which since the mid-1800s. The more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the more heat energy the atmosphere traps near the surface ( ), causing Earth’s surface temperature to rise. The initial warming due to increasing carbon dioxide kicks off several feedback loops: more water vapor, which is a powerful greenhouse gas; permafrost thaw and decomposition, which releases more methane and carbon dioxide; loss of sea ice and snow, which reduces the amount of sunlight the Earth reflects; and outgassing of additional carbon dioxide from the ocean. Together, these feedback loops make the actual warming two or more times larger than it would be due to carbon dioxide increases alone. Which greenhouse gas is more important to Earth’s temperature: water vapor or carbon dioxide? Without our heat-trapping atmosphere, Earth’s surface temperature would be near freezing, instead of close to 60° Fahrenheit. Water vapor is directly responsible for about 50 percent of Earth’s natural greenhouse effect, while carbon dioxide accounts for about 20 percent. So in terms of total warming, water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas. But without the background warmth provided by carbon dioxide—which doesn’t condense and rain out of the atmosphere as water vapor does—the atmosphere would be too cold to support much water vapor, and the entire greenhouse effect would collapse. Models indicate Earth would likely freeze over everywhere but the equator. So in terms of making the greenhouse effect , carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. As the most abundant of the non-condensing , carbon dioxide is the main control knob—the thermostat—of Earth’s greenhouse effect. Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide from human activities are turning the thermostat up. As surface temperatures rise, more water evaporates, enhancing the initial warming. This water vapor feedback loop is powerful, at least doubling the warming provided by carbon dioxide alone. But water vapor can’t act on its own to cause climate change; it can only amplify a change caused by the non-condensing greenhouse gases or other climate influences, such as variations in incoming sunlight. That means that when it comes to causing global warming, carbon dioxide is without question the most important greenhouse gas. Hasn’t Earth warmed and cooled naturally throughout history? Yes. Earth has experienced cold periods (or “ice ages”) and warm periods (“interglacials”) on roughly 100,000-year cycles for at least the last 1 million years. The last of these ices ended around 20,000 years ago. Over the course of these cycles, global average temperatures warmed or cooled anywhere from 3° to perhaps as much as 8° Celsius (5°-15° Fahrenheit). It was partly through their attempts to understand previous ice ages that climate scientists came to understand the dominant role that carbon dioxide plays in Earth’s climate system, and the role it is playing in current global warming. Learn more and . Over at least the past million years, have been triggered by in how much sunlight reaches the Northern Hemisphere in the summer, which are driven by small variations in the geometry of Earth’s orbit around the Sun. But these fluctuations in sunlight aren’t enough on their own to bring about full-blown ice ages and interglacials. They trigger several that amplify the original warming or cooling. During an interglacial, These feedbacks until the Earth’s orbit goes through a phase during which the amount of Northern Hemisphere summer sunlight is minimized. Then these feedbacks operate in reverse, reinforcing the cooling trend. Doesn’t carbon dioxide in the atmosphere come from natural sources? Yes, there are natural sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide, such as outgassing from the ocean, decomposing vegetation and other biomass, venting volcanoes, naturally occurring wildfires, and even belches from ruminant animals. These natural sources of carbon dioxide are offset by “sinks”—things like photosynthesis by plants on land and in the ocean, direct absorption into the ocean, and the creation of soil and peat. During all the ice ages that have occurred over at least the past million years, these opposing branches of the carbon cycle have kept the atmospheric carbon dioxide level at or below 300 parts per million (ppm). , that level is close to 410 ppm. Not only is this the highest carbon dioxide has been during all of human civilization, it has reached these levels virtually instantaneously in geologic time frames. During ice age cycles of the past, a change this large would likely have taken thousands of years to occur. This extremely rapid build-up of carbon dioxide is happening because humans are putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere faster than natural sinks can remove it. By burning fossil fuels, we have essentially taken millions of years of carbon uptake by plants and returned it to the atmosphere in . Do volcanoes emit more carbon dioxide than humans? No, human activities emit 60 or more times the carbon dioxide that volcanoes do in a typical year. Estimates for carbon dioxide emissions from volcanoes range from 0.3 (plus or minus 0.15) billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year to perhaps as much as 0.6 billion metric tons , whereas human activities have been releasing more than 30 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year Couldn’t the Sun cause the globe to warm? If the Sun were to intensify its energy output then, yes, it would warm our world. Indeed, sunspot data indicate there was a small increase in the amount of incoming sunlight between the late 1800s and the mid-1900s that experts estimate contributed to up to 0.1°C of the 1.0°C (1.8°F) of warming observed since the pre-industrial era. However, there has been no significant net change in the Sun’s energy output from the late 1970s to the present, which is when we have observed the most rapid global warming. . A second reason that scientists have ruled out a significant role for the Sun in global warming is that if the Sun’s energy output had intensified, we would expect all layers of Earth’s atmosphere to have warmed. But we don’t see that. Rather, satellites and observations from weather balloons show warming in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and cooling in the upper stratosphere (stratosphere)—which is exactly what we would expect to see as a result of increasing greenhouse gases trapping heat in the lower atmosphere. Scientists regard this piece of evidence as one of several “smoking guns” linking today’s global warming to human-emitted, heat-trapping gases. Do humans also exert a cooling influence on Earth’s climate? Yes, humans exert a cooling influence on Earth in several ways. But, overall, these are smaller than the warming influence of the heat-trapping gases humans put into the air. Our greatest cooling influence comes from particulate pollution (aerosols) we produce. We put plumes of aerosols into the air from power plants and industrial smokestacks; smoke and gases from biomass burning; windblown dust from deforested areas, dried wetlands, and crop fields; exhaust from ships’ smokestacks; tailpipe emissions from cars, trucks, buses, and trains; etc. Aerosol particles absorb and reflect the sun’s rays, thereby reducing the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface. They also interact with clouds, in many cases making them brighter and longer-lived, also reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the surface. . Whereas aerosols linger in the atmosphere from days to a few weeks, heat-trapping gases that we add to the atmosphere linger from decades to centuries. Plus, when scientists discovered that our aerosol emissions were causing other undesired harmful side effects—such as acid rain and human respiratory diseases and deaths—we began to regulate and reduce their emission. Thus, the warming effect of our heat-trapping gases is ultimately winning out over the cooling influence of our particle pollution. . What role does the ocean play in global warming? The ocean has absorbed between 20–30 percent of all human-produced carbon dioxide emissions since the 1980s. This absorption has kept large amounts of this heat-trapping gas out of the atmosphere, making the rate of warming slower than it would otherwise be, but it has also lowered the pH (increased the acidity) of ocean surface waters. makes it harder for shell-building marine life—including commercially and culturally valuable species such as coral, crabs, and oysters—to build and maintain their shells. Because of its tremendous volume and high heat capacity, the ocean has absorbed more than 90 percent of all excess heat trapped in Earth's climate system by greenhouse gases. Currents mix much of that heat into deeper layers of the ocean, delaying the full impact of surface warming we would otherwise expect. However, the heating of deeper layers of the ocean still contributes to sea level rise, sea ice retreat, marine heatwaves, oxygen depletion and expanding dead zones, shifts in the ranges of several marine species, and accelerating loss of polar ice shelves. Does global warming mean it’s warming everywhere? No, “global warming” means Earth’s annual average air temperature is rising over long time spans (many decades to centuries), but not necessarily and not necessarily in all seasons. It’s like your grades—if you get Bs and Cs in your first semester and in the next semester you get all As and Cs, your overall grade point average rises even though you didn’t improve in every class. Differences in exposure to sunlight, cloud cover, atmospheric circulation patterns, aerosol concentrations, atmospheric humidity, land surface cover, etc., all vary from place to place which, in turn, influence whether and how much a location is warming or cooling. Learn more , , , and . What is an \"extreme event\"? Scientists can characterize an extreme event in three different ways: Generally speaking, an extreme event is any event that ranks in the highest or lowest 5 percent or 10 percent of all historical observations of that type of event. The percentage threshold is arbitrary and is designated by a researcher to provide context on a given event or set of events. Scientists sometimes describe extreme events in terms of their “sigmas” (or their “standard deviation”), which is a measure of how far removed an individual value is from the average of all observations in a data set. So, if a climate expert describes a heavy rain event as a “5-sigma event,” s/he is talking about rainfall so extreme that it was 5 standard deviations away from the average rainfall for that location—way out at the tail end of the range of all values that have ever been observed. . Another way of characterizing an extreme event is by describing the probability of occurrence in a given span of time. Based on historical observations, experts to estimate the range of all possible events that we would eventually expect to observe if our data record was long enough. From this range of all possible values, they can pinpoint how frequently a particular value would be expected to recur within a given amount of time. For example, 100-year event means an event is so extreme that it has only a 1 percent chance (1 divided by 100) of happening in any given year. A thousand-year event has a 0.1 percent chance of happening in any single year (1 divided by 1,000). . Was this or that extreme weather or climate event caused by global warming? To date, climate research has yet to show that any given event was caused by global warming. However, over the past decade, that climate change due to global warming has made many extreme events more likely, more intense, longer-lasting, or larger in scale than they would have been without it. For many of the events that have been studied, global warming has been identified as the primary driver of the event, not just a supporting player. And a number of recent studies have concluded that certain heat-related extreme events would not have been possible without human-caused global warming. Learn more and . is the science of figuring out what caused a given extreme weather or climate event, and weighting the relative influence of global warming versus natural variability. The biggest collection of research dedicated to understanding the causes of extreme events is published annually in a special issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. The most recent edition of the report, was the eighth in the series. (The report covering a selection of events from 2019 is soon to be released). Together, these eight reports have documented 168 attribution studies, 73 percent of which identified a substantial link between an extreme event and human-caused climate change, whereas 27 percent did not. To learn more, go and If Earth has warmed and cooled naturally, why are scientists so concerned about today’s global warming? Experts are concerned about today’s global warming because it is different from previous warming periods in three key ways: the reason, the rate, and the repercussions. Ice ages and warm periods over the past million years or more were triggered by variations in the amount of sunlight reaching the Northern Hemisphere during summer and then amplified by other climate feedbacks. But today’s warming is mainly due to humans increasing the abundance of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Today’s warming is occurring much more quickly than previous interglacial episodes. In transitions from an ice age to an interglacial, it took 5,000–10,000 years for the temperature to rise between 5 and 9° Fahrenheit (3–5° Celsius). Humans could witness the same amount of global warming within the next 80 years if we continue emitting heat-trapping gases at today’s rate. Finally, if we cause our world to warm by 2.7°F (1.5°C) or more compared to the temperatures before the start of the Industrial Revolution, scientists warn that there will be harmful repercussions for human health, the economy, infrastructure, and agriculture and natural resources. The greater the warming above that threshold, the more widespread and severe the impacts are likely to be. Human and natural systems that cannot adapt quickly enough may be overwhelmed. A global warming of 1.8°F (1°C) seems small, given that some locations experience temperature swings of 30°F or more in a single day. Why is this change in global temperature a concern? Daily temperature swings of tens of degrees at a given location are common weather-driven events. But historically, when measurements of the daily high and low temperatures from many thousands of locations all over the world are averaged together over a whole year, the Earth's annual average temperature fluctuated by from year to year. In a geological context, a global-scale warming of 1.8°F (1°C) in less than 150 years is an unusually large temperature change in a relatively short span of time. It's also important to recognize that Earth is not warming uniformly, nor is it expected to. Middle and high latitudes in general will warm more than the tropics, and land surface temperatures will rise more than ocean temperatures. Over the long term, land masses at the latitude of the United States are expected to warm much more than the global average. If global warming continues at an increasing rate, in several decades the world is likely to be warmer than it's been for over a million years, with unpredictable consequences for humans and the natural resources we depend on. How will global warming harm human health and well-being in the United States? More . More . How will global warming harm natural and agricultural resources in the United States? The ability of forests and other ecosystems to provide culturally and economically important services—timber, water supply protection, livestock forage, recreation, fisheries, and hunting—are likely to decline as a result of human-caused climate change due to increased disturbance from water stress, fires, pest outbreaks, invasive species, heat stress, ocean acidification, and drought. These negative impacts will increase with higher rates of warming. In terms of biodiversity, adaptable species with wide geographic ranges—such as white-tailed deer and feral hogs—are likely to continue to thrive. But those species that depend on particular habitats—polar and alpine species, coral reefs, coldwater fishes—are vulnerable, as are the communities that depend on them culturally and economically. According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, “[S]pecies, including many iconic species, may disappear from regions where they have been prevalent or become extinct, altering some regions so much that their mix of plant and animal life will become almost unrecognizable.” Food and forage production will decline in agricultural regions experiencing increased frequency and duration of drought. Even without drought, higher temperatures will increase evaporation of soil moisture, increasing crop stress and water demand—further stressing U.S. surface and groundwater supplies used for irrigation. And even with irrigation, many commodity crops are likely to experience declines in average yield as temperatures rise beyond their preferred heat tolerance range. Milder winters and shifts in precipitation are likely to increase the incidence of pests and diseases for crops and livestock, while extreme heat—especially nighttime heat—will reduce livestock productivity. Impacts will vary from region to region, depending on the extent of warming and the level of adaptation. . How will global warming harm U.S. communities, infrastructure, and the economy? Nationwide, the cost of weather and climate-related disasters is already rising, and the trend is likely to continue as many extreme events become more frequent and severe. The economic impacts of extreme events include not just the direct damages, but also the loss of productivity and interruption of essential services and supply chains that can reach deep into the national economy. In many parts of the country, existing infrastructure—septic and stormwater systems, roads, bridges, the energy grid—was not designed to cope with current and future sea level and climate extremes, and current levels of investment aren’t enough to cover necessary repairs and upgrades. Beyond extreme events, human-caused climate change is likely to disrupt many sectors of the U.S. economy and the communities that depend on them, including commercial and recreational fisheries, tourism and recreation, and agriculture. Are there benefits from global warming? Yes, there will probably be some short-term and long-term benefits from global warming. For example, the flip side of increased mortality from heat waves may be decreased mortality from cold waves. In the short term, farmers in some regions may benefit from the earlier onset of spring and from a longer warm season that is suitable for growing crops. Also, studies show that, up to a certain point, crops and other plants grow better in the presence of higher carbon dioxide levels and seem to be more drought-tolerant. But this benefit is a two-edged sword: weeds, many invasive plant species, and insect pests will also thrive in a warmer world. Water availability will be impacted in drier agricultural areas that need irrigation. At some point, the benefits to crops of increased carbon dioxide will likely be overwhelmed by the negative impacts of heat stress and drought. In the long term, shipping commerce will benefit from the opening of the Northwest Passage for longer periods of the year due to the loss of Arctic sea ice. However, in the long run, if a \"business as usual\" approach to emitting heat-trapping gases is maintained at the present rate, or faster, then the negative costs and impacts of global warming are very likely to far outweigh the benefits over the course of this century, with increased potential for catastrophic impacts from more extreme events. In part, this is because any substantial change, whether warmer or colder, would challenge the societal infrastructure that has developed under the current climate. Can we slow or stop human-caused global warming? Yes. While we cannot stop global warming overnight, or even over the next several decades, we can slow the rate and limit the amount of global warming by reducing human emissions of heat-trapping gases and soot (“black carbon”). If all human emissions of heat-trapping gases were to stop today, Earth’s temperature would continue to rise for a few decades as ocean currents bring excess heat stored in the deep ocean back to the surface. Once this excess heat radiated out to space, Earth’s temperature would stabilize. Experts think the additional warming from this “hidden” heat is unlikely to exceed 0.9° Fahrenheit (0.5°Celsius). With no further human influence, natural processes would begin to slowly remove the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and global temperatures would gradually begin to decline. It’s true that without dramatic action in the next couple of decades, we are unlikely to keep global warming in this century below 2.7° Fahrenheit (1.5° Celsius) compared to pre-industrial temperatures—a threshold that experts say offers a lower risk of serious negative impacts. But the more we overshoot that threshold, the more serious and widespread the negative impacts will be, which means that it is never “too late” to take action. What actions can we take to stop or slow global warming? There is no one-size-fits-all approach to stopping or slowing global warming, and each individual, business, municipal, state, tribal, and federal entity must weigh their options in light of their own unique set of circumstances. it is likely many strategies working together will be needed. Generally speaking, here are some examples of mitigation strategies we can use to slow or stop the human-caused global warming ( ): Note that NOAA doesn’t advocate for or against particular climate policies.

        "content": "No, but thanks to natural variability, volcanic eruptions, and relatively low solar activity, the rate of average global surface warming from 1998-2012 was slower than it had been for two to three decades leading up to it. How slower depends on the fine print: you look at, whether it includes the Arctic, and the you compare. Regardless, the big picture of long-term global warming remained unchanged. ( ) Based on NOAA data, global average surface temperature (orange line) has risen 0.13°F (0.07°C) per decade since 1880 (red line), which is nearly identical to the rate of warming during the 15-year period from 1998-2012 (gray line). ( ) The rate of warming from 1998-2012 was slower than the two preceding 15-year periods, but faster than the two 15-year periods before that. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI. Those who deny the scientific evidence of turned the slowdown into a slogan: “Global warming stopped in 1998.” In scientific journals and assessment reports, climate experts described the episode as a “pause” or “hiatus” in the previous decades’ rapid warming: they knew it wouldn’t last. Not only was 1998-2012 the warmest 15-year period on record at the time, but greenhouse gases continued to climb to , and other climate indicators continued to show the impacts of long-term, global-scale warming: subsurface , global , the of glaciers and ice sheets, and record-low extent. Like a hiking trail over hilly terrain, the global surface temperature can rise steeply, level out, or even fall for short “distances.” Overall, though, it’s a climb from the trailhead to the summit. NOAA Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh. Like previous episodes in the historical record, the slowdown in the rate of surface warming during the early twenty-first century was temporary. Global average surface temperatures set a new record in 2014, again in 2015, and in 2016. The rate of surface warming since the late 1980s has been more than twice as fast as the warming averaged over the entire historical record.

Maps by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NOAA NCEI. The relative slowdown in surface warming from 1998-2012 compared to the preceding decades was just the latest example of the short-term cooling influences overlapping with the long-term global warming trend. The slowdown in surface warming from 1998­­–2012 relative to previous decades started with one of the strongest El Niño events on record. El Niño is the warm phase of a powerful in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Niño emerges irregularly every few years, taking turns with La Niña, its cool-phase partner. The pattern is anchored in the tropics, but it has a global impact. In any given decade, the warmest years are usually El Niño years; the coldest are usually La Niña ones. [See in our El Niña/La Niña FAQ.] The contributed to the largest (at the time) one-year jump in global average surface temperature on record, helping to make 1998 the warmest year of the twentieth century. Choosing a record-warm year as the starting point for a trend analysis increases the odds of . The influence of that record-warm El Niño year on short-term temperature trends was amplified by a heavy tilt toward La Niña events over the next 15 years. Following the strong 1997-98 El Niño, La Niña events (blue shading) outnumbered El Niño events (red shading) over the next 15 years, contributing to the 1998-2012 surface warming slowdown. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, based on from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. Often, El Niño and La Niña events are embedded within the warm and cool phases of an even larger-scale climate pattern: the (“PDO” for short). The PDO influences surface temperature across the entire Pacific north of the equator. As its name implies, the PDO its warm or cool phases for a decade or more at a time. Around 2000, the cool phase became more common. During the cool phases of the PDO, prevailing winds drive strong ocean circulations that push heated surface water deeper into the ocean and draw cooler water up to the surface. Heat doesn’t disappear; it just doesn’t all show up at the surface. During the early twenty-first century, observations of the water column down to depths of 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) showed excess heat continued to accumulate in the ocean. Water has tremendous heat capacity. Natural variations in winds and currents can shift heat from the surface to deeper parts of the ocean. Observations of the amount of heat energy stored in the top 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) of the ocean show that ocean heating continued during the surface warming slowdown. NOAA Climate.gov, adapted from Figure 1 in Cheng et al., 2017. The Sun has an 11-year geomagnetic cycle. From the peak to the minimum, the average amount of energy reaching the top of Earth’s atmosphere varies by about 0.1%. It’s a small difference: in an average cycle, it’s only enough to warm or cool Earth’s surface temperature by approximately 0.05 degrees Celsius. (There also appears to have been a small, long-term increase in solar activity in the early twentieth century, which added to the human-caused global warming trend during that period). The solar cycles that coincided with the 1998-2012 surface warming slowdown were below average. Solar cycle 23 had an unusually long and low minimum, and solar cycle 24 had the lowest maximum in more than a century. The relatively weak solar activity made a small contribution to slowing surface warming in the early part of the new century. The peaks and valleys in solar geomagnetic activity since 1900, based on the number of sunspots observed on the face of the Sun each day (orange dots). The minimum of solar cycle 23 was unusually drawn out, and the maximum of the next cycle was among the lowest of the past century. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from the WDC-SILSO, Royal Observatory of Belgium. Along with ash and other debris, volcanic eruptions include sulfur dioxide gas. Sulfur dioxide reacts with water vapor to produce sulfate particles. These aerosol particles act like billions of tiny mirrors, reflecting a fraction of incoming sunlight. Most eruptions aren’t powerful enough to influence the climate on a global scale. But an eruption that is powerful enough to reach the —especially in the tropics, where the particles spread easily to both hemispheres—can cool the climate for several years. Soufriere Hills Volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat erupted repeatedly in the first decade of the twenty-first century, most notably in 2002, 2006, and 2009. On October 11, 2009, an astronaut on the International Space Station captured this image of a volcanic plume of ash and gases towering over the southwestern corner of the island. Image courtesy NASA-JSC Gateway to Astronaut Photography of the Earth. Normally, when we talk about climate-scale eruptions, we are talking about cataclysmic events like the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. While we haven’t seen any eruptions like that in recent years, a number of moderate eruptions took place in the tropics between 2000-2010. Together, these eruptions—especially the 2006 eruptions of Montserrat’s Soufriere Hills Volcano and Papua New Guinea’s Tavurvur Volcano—gradually boosted the amount of light-reflecting particles in the stratosphere during the warming slowdown period. Stratospheric haze peaked following the cataclysmic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, was low throughout the mid- to late 1990s, and gradually built back up in the first decade of the 2000s due to moderate but frequent eruptions of tropical volcanoes. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, based on SAGE, GOMOS, and CALIPSO data provided by Jean-Paul Vernier. In order to verify the combined impact of these cooling influences on surface temperatures, experts have turned to virtual worlds simulated by computer-driven mathematical climate models. Experiments have demonstrated that both Pacific Ocean variability and random atmospheric variations are each capable of generating a surface warming slowdown that matches the 1998-2012 period, not just in amount, but also in its geographic details. When models also include observed patterns of volcanic aerosols and low solar activity, temperatures projections match observations even more closely.

Graphs by NOAA Climate.gov, adapted from Figure 5 in Medhaung, et al., 2017. The surface warming slowdown between 1998 and 2012 turned into a great opportunity for climate experts to take a fresh look at the influence of all the players in the climate game, to scrutinize observational records, and to test models. But it wasn’t a chance to escape the reality that rising concentrations of and other continue to warm Earth’s climate over the long term. Balmaseda, M. A., K. E. Trenberth and E.

The most commonly measured climate variables are temperature and precipitation, the latter being available for more than 100,000 locations worldwide. Some stations (such as those at airports) also observe additional variables—including pressure, wind, and cloud cover—on an hourly basis. Coverage of the stations is sparse in some regions; however, most airports have a station. Many modeling applications require data in locations that do not have weather stations. Gridded datasets bridge this gap. These datasets consist of estimated data at evenly spaced intervals, such as every 5 kilometers. Researchers construct these datasets by using station data in combination with statistical methods (e.g., by interpolating station data to a uniform grid or fitting a statistical surface through the original observations). Gridded datasets are valuable in many modeling applications that require evenly spaced data as input. They are also useful in computing averages for societally relevant areas, such as counties and census tracts. Interpolated grids estimate unknown values at locations by using nearby points where values are known. Comprehensive Climate Monitoring data, also known as Reanalysis datasets, are produced by running climate models over a historical period while constraining many of the values of the model to match observed values. These data are multivariate, spatially and temporally complete, and gridded. This process provides a consistent high-resolution output that smooths over data gaps by providing the best possible estimate of the true values by using both observations and models to estimate what value most likely would have been observed. For example, in a reanalysis for the period from 1950 to 2000, if a station was only active from 1970 onward, the 20 years of missing values can be estimated by constraining the model using existing observations that were active so that the temperature (and other values) that might have been observed at that station can be filled in. Climate models break the globe into a 3-dimensional grid and simulate a large number of variables in each grid cell at each time step using fundamental physics equations. Climate models are “spun up” by initializing them with observations and letting them run over many years of timesteps, solving the equations for each grid cell during each step, and allowing for interactions between adjacent grid cells. Climate model output should be used to estimate longer-term, probabilistic climate statistics rather than to predict deterministic values. A Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) is a product containing outputs from one or more models from different modeling centers that have been averaged together to create what is called an ensemble. In some cases, more than one model run (realization) per model is included, and each realization is run with slightly perturbed parameters to better represent uncertainty in the MME mean. MMEs are often more skillful than individual models, and better represent prediction error, because the ensemble as a whole balances out individual model biases to some extent.

Rather than having to describe the full range of conditions observed in a region over each month or season of a year, a classification scheme can communicate expected conditions using just two or three terms. Knowing a region’s climate classification can be useful when choosing building materials for protection and durability, or when considering what crops are likely (or unlikely) to thrive in a region. For visitors, knowing a location’s climate classification can help them select appropriate clothing to pack. Geographers recognize a number of factors that affect a region’s climate: Together, these factors control the range of temperatures and the amount of rain and/or snow each region receives through the year. These factors control climate, and in turn, climate controls ecology—the types of native plants and animals that live in a region. Map by , Finlayson, B. L., and McMahon, T. A. (University of Melbourne) via . Long-term records of temperature and precipitation reveal climate patterns across continents, delineating them into climate regions. For example, the image on the right shows the . Class names for classification systems based on weather patterns often include geographical names such as polar, tropical, continental, and marine. These terms are modified by terms describing temperature and moisture, or the intensity of weather during summer or winter. Examples of descriptors used in this method of classification include moist or dry, warm or cold, and temperate or severe. Putting them together results in climate classifications such as \"polar marine\" and \"temperate continental.\" Map by Ville Koistinen, , via Environmental indicators such as the range of native vegetation that thrives in a place can be used to classify a region's climate. As plant species can only thrive within a specific range of temperature and moisture conditions, it follows that those conditions must be present if the plants thrive in that location. If the climate is not suitable—too wet, too dry, or too cold in winter, for example—plants (and the animals that depend upon them for food or habitat) will struggle or die. These classification systems also utilize geographic terms, but are modified by biome names. Class names based on environmental indicators include names such as Arctic tundra, subtropical rainforest, and montane forests. Image by Peter Halasz, , via . The Classification scheme uses latitude, altitude, and humidity to identify a region's climate (see the diagram at right; click for a larger view). As classifications are based on plotting just three physical parameters—the straightforward system has become popular in modeling climate change impacts. Class names in this system are generally descriptive. Examples include dry tundra, wet forest, and desert scrub. As a region's temperature and precipitation patterns change, . Comparing past, present, and future ranges of plants and animals is one method that can show changing classifications. Scientists are currently observing changes in ecological relationships that are linked to our changing climate. For instance, the timing of spring budburst in some plants is occuring earlier than in the past. If this change in timing is not matched by the maturity of insects that depend on nectar from those flowers, the insects will lose this food supply.

For instance, layers of sediments can accumulate over many years, and some of them preserve information about weather conditions during the time they were deposited. Throughout Earth's history, global and regional climate has changed on very long time scales, and many of the past conditions can be discovered by studying natural records. Paleoclimatology is the study of natural systems that record climate conditions. Analyses of growth patterns in tree rings, corals, and cave structures can help us deduce conditions that existed hundreds to millions of years ago. Data that come from natural sources instead of from instruments are called proxy records. The word \"proxy\" indicates that these records stand in for direct measurements. Tree-core drill and wood core samples next to a tree slab. Dendrochronologists (tree-time scientists) count the number of growth rings and record the pattern of their widths. The pattern of varying widths can be matched against those of other tree rings to tell their age. Photo by Hannes Grobe . One of the most easily recognized types of paleoclimate records is tree ring data. Trees that grow a single annual ring can preserve a record of the conditions they experienced each year. Rocks deposited by glaciers are another example of proxy records. Scientists can recognize the distinctive pattern of sediments in rocks deposited by glaciers. Wherever they find glacial rocks then, they know that glaciers were present in that location at some point in the past. Once they examine fossils and other clues about when the rocks were deposited, they use the information to reconstruct the climate story for that location. Other sources of proxy data for climate include lake and ocean sediments, layers of ice (cored from ice sheets), corals, fossils, and historical records from ship logs and early weather observers. The most familiar methods to interpret natural records involve taking a core sample of the thing that produced the natural record. Field scientists use specialized equipment to take cores from trees, corals, sediments, and ice. By measuring the width, chemical composition, and physical structure of each layer in the core, scientists can deduce the conditions present when each layer formed. Another way to learn about past climate is to take the temperature of rocks at different depths by mounting thermometers at different depths within boreholes drilled directly into the Earth’s crust. Rocks respond very slowly to changes in surface temperature conditions, and deeper rocks change temperatures more slowly than shallower rocks. Precise measurements of the rate of temperature change of rocks at various depths can be correlated to past temperatures at the surface. More about boreholes, including links to borehole data: Paleoclimate records become even more valuable when scientists compare information collected from locations around the world. Comparing their analyses, they have identified common patterns of temperature trends that are broadly consistent across a variety of data collection methods. By comparing multiple sets of proxy records, scientists have been able to reconstruct a fairly consistent story of Earth’s climate for the past few thousand years. See While the methods of calculating global average temperature from different proxies vary from team to team, the outcomes are broadly consistent over time, and they converge with the instrumental record. The broad agreement of several datasets increases our confidence that proxies reveal valid temperature records. The set of charts below shows the general agreement among results from multiple science teams using different methods to understand how temperatures have changed over time.

But as far as the “recent” past, a published in March 2013 concluded that global average temperature is now higher than it has been for most of the last 11,300 years. The scientists assembled dozens of temperature records from multiple studies, including data from sediment cores drilled in lake bottoms and sea floors, and from ice cores. Assembling data from 73 records that overlap in time, the scientists pieced together global average temperatures since the end of the last ice age.

The 11,000-year temperature reconstruction shows global average temperature increasing after the end of the last ice age and leveling off about 7550 and 3550 BC. After that time, global temperatures dropped until the bottoming out somewhere between AD 1450 and 1850. Afterwards temperatures rose again, first slowly then very rapidly.

Over the past century, though, global average temperatures have \"risen from near the coldest to the warmest levels\" in the past 11,300 years, the 2013 study authors explain. Over this same period, emissions of heat-trapping gases from human activities have increased. Given the uncertainty inherent in estimating ancient temperatures, the scientists conservatively concluded that the last decade has brought global average temperatures higher than they have been for at least 75 percent of the last 11,300 years.

Said another way, global warming is one symptom of the much larger problem of human-caused climate change. Global warming is just one symptom of the much larger problem of climate change. NOAA Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh. Another distinction between global warming and climate change is that when scientists or public leaders talk about these days, they almost always mean -caused warming—warming due to the rapid increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from people burning coal, oil, and gas. Climate change, on the other hand, can mean human-caused changes or natural ones, such as ice ages. Besides burning fossil fuels, humans can cause climate changes by emitting aerosol pollution—the tiny particles that reflect sunlight and cool the climate— into the atmosphere, or by transforming the Earth's landscape, for instance, from carbon-storing forests to farmland. The planet has experienced climate change before: the Earth’s average temperature throughout the planet’s 4.54 billion-year history. The planet has experienced long cold periods (\"ice ages\") and warm periods (\"interglacials\") on 100,000-year cycles for at least the last million years. Previous warming episodes were triggered by small increases in how much sunlight reached Earth’s surface and then amplified by large releases of carbon dioxide from the oceans as they warmed (like the fizz escaping from a warm soda). Increases and decreases in global temperature during the naturally occurring ice ages of the past 800,000 years, ending with the early twentieth century. NOAA Climate.gov graph by Fiona Martin, based on EPICA Dome C ice core provided by the Paleoclimatology Program at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Today’s global warming is overwhelmingly due to the increase in heat-trapping gases that humans are adding to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. In fact, over the last five decades, natural factors (solar forcing and volcanoes) would actually have led to a slight cooling of Earth’s surface temperature. Global warming is also different from past warming in its rate. The current increase in global average temperature appears to be occurring much faster than at any point since modern civilization and agriculture developed in the past 11,000 years or so—and probably faster than any interglacial warm periods over the last million years. Temperatures over most of the past 2000 years compared to the 1961-1990 average, based on proxy data (tree rings, ice cores, corals) and modern thermometer-based data. Over the past two millenia, climate warmed and cooled, but no previous warming episodes appear to have been as large and abrupt as recent global warming. NOAA Climate.gov graph by Fiona Martin, adapted from in the based on from Mann et al., 2008. Regardless of whether you say that climate change is all the side effects of global warming, or that global warming is one symptom of human-caused climate change, you’re essentially talking about the same basic phenomenon: the build up of excess heat energy in the Earth system. So why do we have two ways of describing what is basically the same thing? According to , the use of more than one term to describe different aspects of the same phenomenon tracks the progress of scientists’ understanding of the problem. As far back as the late 1800s, scientists were hypothesizing that industrialization, driven by the burning of fossil fuels for energy, had the potential to modify the climate. For many decades, though, they weren’t sure whether cooling (due to reflection of sunlight from pollution) or warming (due to greenhouse gases) would dominate. By the mid-1970s, however, more and more evidence suggested warming would dominate and that it would be unlike any previous, naturally triggered warming episode. The phrase “global warming” emerged to describe that scientific consensus. Change in temperature (degrees per century) from 1900-2014. Gray areas indicate where there is insufficient data to detect a long-term trend. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. But over subsequent decades, scientists became more aware that global warming was not the only impact of excess heat absorbed by greenhouse gases. Other changes—sea level rise, intensification of the water cycle, stress on plants and animals—were likely to be far more important to our daily lives and economies. By the 1990s, scientists increasingly used “human-caused climate change” to describe the challenge facing the planet. Today’s global warming is an unprecedented type of climate change, and it is driving a in our climate system. It’s these side effects, such as changes in sea level along heavily populated coastlines and the worldwide retreat of mountain glaciers that millions of people depend on for drinking water and agriculture, that are likely to have a much greater impact on society than temperature change alone.

        "content": "The summer of 2016 overflowed with extreme rain events. Here at Climate.gov, we’ve written about two of them: and . After the historic flooding in West Virginia in June, the National Weather Service said that in parts of West Virginia, 24-hour rainfall amounts—more than 10 inches in some places—were a thousand-year event. We often do not have observations that go back 100 years, let alone 1,000. So how do scientists figure that out? The answer lies in statistics. An \"early glimpse\" of 24-hour rainfall totals from storms over West Virginia on June 23, 2016, based on data from Oregon State University. \" \" data may not include data from all stations in the reporting network, and totals should be considered preliminary. Even the preliminary totals are enormous, however, with up to 8 inches of rain in many areas of southeastern West Virginia. Map by NOAA Climate.gov. Estimating the size of a thousand-year event using a much shorter history of observations is like how paleontologists can take an incomplete collection of fossilized bones and turn them into a picture of what T-rex probably looked like when alive. The climate “bones” are all the observations we have. Since we have an admittedly incomplete set of weather observations, we have to use what we’ve got to create an image of the actual climate “dinosaur.” Let’s work through it with a real-life example. I have compiled over 80 years’ worth of daily rainfall observations from the Beckley VA Hospital in West Virginia, near where June rains were so extraordinary. First, I eliminated any year with more than 10 days of missing data. Next, I pulled the highest daily rainfall amount that occurred in each year (1). Some years clearly have larger daily rainfall maximums than others. Annual maximum daily precipitation totals from 1909 to 2015 at a weather station located at Beckley VA Hospital in West Virginia. Years where more than 10 days of precipitation data were missing are excluded. NOAA Climate.gov based on data from the . To figure out how rare a particular rainfall event was, we need to understand the range of the data. We’ll start by putting the values in order from smallest to largest. Annual maximum precipitation totals (inches) sorted from smallest to largest for 82 years at Beckley VA hospital in Beckley, West Virginia. The annual maximum precipitation total exceeded 4 inches in only two of the 82 years. NOAA Climate.gov map based on station data from the . Ordering the data from lowest to highest allows us to see the spread in totals but doesn’t help us figure out what is the most common daily rainfall maximum. For that, we need to sort the values into bins defined by rainfall amount (a bin for 0 inches, 0-0.25, 0.25-0.5 inches etc), like sorting clothes into piles based on size. It is at this step, that we can begin to see if there is a pattern. A histogram of annual daily maximum precipitation totals for Beckley, West Virginia. There are 82 years in total. Precipitation totals are sorted into 0.25-inch bins. The most common bin, with 18 events, represented daily precipitation totals between 2 and 2.25 inches. 80 of the 82 years had precipitation amounts less than 4 inches. NOAA Climate.gov figure based on data from the Certain piles have more items of clothing in them than others: we have more mediums than extra-larges so to speak. It is clear that some yearly 24-hour rainfall maximums occur more often than others. In 18 of 80 years, the highest 24-hour rainfall was between 2 and 2.25 inches. In 15 years, the highest daily rainfall total was between 1.75 and 2.0 inches. Only one time in 80 years was there a daily record above 5 inches. However, the other thing that is clear is that the spread is incomplete. In this example, there are no years in which the highest daily rainfall total was between 4 and 4.5 inches, but there are some cases between 4.5-4.75 inches and 5.25-5.5 inches. It’s not physically plausible that the atmosphere would just never produce those rain amounts. It’s more logical to assume that if we had enough data going far enough back or forward in time, that there would eventually be a daily event filling in the gaps. This is where statistics come in. Scientists apply what they call a “distribution” (the dark line in the figure below), a relationship of the magnitude of the rainfall to how often that rainfall amounts occurs (2). The distribution line is like the final picture of the dinosaur. It uses the observations (bones) as the input for a reconstruction of the whole climate picture. The observations from Beckley, WV, of the frequency of rain events of different sizes (dots inside bars) can be used to estimate the full range of likely events and their frequency (dark line). This statistical estimate is called the , and it's like the process of using the bones from an incomplete dinosaur skeleton to describe what the complete creature probably looked like. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NCEI. And now, researchers can see how often an event of rainfall amount is likely to occur. In fact, if we consider the total area under the curve (dark line) and recognize that it must equal 1.0 (100%), then the probability of a single event of a given size occurring at some point is simply the area under that portion of the curve. The probability of a yearly daily maximum rainfall event greater than 4 inches, for example, is just the area from 4 on the x-axis to the right, bounded by the distribution line. In this type of graph, the curved line marks a hypothetical list of all possible extreme rainfall events, with the caveat that the total area under the curved line must equal 1.0 or 100%. The percent chance of any single rain event being more than a specific amount is the percent of the total area to the right of that rainfall amount. The percent chance of a rain event less than or equal to that threshold can be found by subtracting the area to the right of the threshold from 100. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov. Since we can figure out the probability for a given rainfall amount, we can also figure out what rainfall amounts correspond to specific probabilities like 0.1%, or said another way, a 1-in-1,000 year event (1/1000). Using the area under the line, we can also flip the calcuation. Instead of finding the percent chance of an event of a certain size, we can find the amount of rain associated with an event of a certain probability. In Beckley, WV, the amount of rain associated with an event that has 0.1% chance of ocurring is 7.25 inches. Because a 0.1% chance is the same as 0.001, or 1 in 1,000, such events have been nicknamed \"thousand-year\" events.\" Graph by NOAA Climate.gov. Is the statistical estimate perfect? Of course not. There are many different types of distributions used for different variables, depending on what assumptions you make about the phenomenon you’re talking about. You can even use different distributions for the same variable like precipitation! The distribution is an assumption, after all. And for events which are very rare, there is a great deal of uncertainty. Small differences in what a distribution line looks like at the extremes can have large impacts on the probabilities of uncommon events. Therefore, scientists can be more confident in the rainfall amounts needed for a 1-in-100-year storm than a 1-in-1,000-year event, and they often don’t even bother to estimate out beyond that. This story's example, in particular, is a much simpler version of the already done by NOAA scientists. The return periods (0 to 1000 years) for rainfall amounts from 0 to over 7 inches based on 82 years of annual daily maximum precipitation data from Beckley, West Virginia. A 1 in 1000 year event, as calculated using the basic statistical technique of applying a distribution, would mean daily rainfall amounts of over 7 inches. During the event just north of this location on June 23, 2016, over 8 inches of rain fell in some locations in just 24 hours. NOAA Climate.gov figure based on data from the . To bring it back to the dinosaur picture, when I was growing up, dinosaurs had no feathers. Nowadays, feathered dinosaurs are much more widely accepted. What happened? More data and a better understanding led to a change in the picture (or the distribution, if we are talking rain). The same can happen here. More observations and research can help fine tune the climate picture. At the start of every school year, I used to guess what the chances of extreme weather events that year would be. As a typical kid, I remember always guessing (or hoping) that there was a 50% chance we would get a foot of snow at some point that winter that would cancel school. But I have no control over the likelihood of extreme events; only Mother Nature does (disregarding for a second how human-caused climate change can affect things). There are different chances for all possible weather events. What the distribution shows us is that some events are more likely than others. There is a high chance, for instance, that at some point in the next year it rains more than 0.25 inches in West Virginia. There are also events that are so extreme that their chance of occurring in any given year is pretty small. If an event has only a 1% chance of happening in a year, that is equivalent to 1 divided by 100, or said another way a 1-in-100-year storm. A one-in-a-thousand year event would have a 0.1% chance (1 divided by 1,000) of occurring in any given year. The 1-day rainfall amounts that have have a 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% chance of occuring each year. Over very long periods of time, such events are likely to occur with an average frequency of 1-in-100, 1-in-500, or 1-in-1,000 years. Maps and animation by NOAA Climate.gov, based on . Importantly, this is not saying that if a thousand-year event occurs that you have to wait another 1,000 years for the next one. There can be multiple events of that magnitude within 1,000 years or none. All that is being said is that there is a 0.1% chance of that event occurring in any given year. We can even calculate the probability that a thousand-year event will occur during an arbitrary millennium. If there is a 0.1% chance the event occurs in any year, it also means there is a 99.9% chance it won’t. The probability of not seeing the event 1,000 years in a row would be equal to 0.999 (99.9%) raised to the 1000 power (# of years), which equals a 36.8% chance that the 1-in-1000-year event will not occur during any single randomly chosen 1,000-year time period, and a 63.2% chance that it will. Yup. When scientists are attempting to paint a picture of the climate using past observations, it is best if the climate is not changing that much. A changing climate means relying on a past that may not be as helpful. In fact, global warming can of a climate variable entirely. For instance, according to the issued in 2012 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it is likely that a 1 in 20 year extreme 24-hour precipitation events will become a 1 in 5 to 15 year event by the end of the century in many regions. The picture could change, which leaves scientists in a tough position of figuring out the rarity of extreme events on one hand, while recognizing that the chances of these events may already be changing due to climate change on the other. (1) Another approach is to gather all of the largest events without the limitation of one per year. For example, if we were looking at 80 years’ worth of data, we would select the 80 largest events regardless of whether they occurred in the same year or not. This will lead to a slightly different dataset of extreme rainfall events but for this exercise, the conclusion would not be changed. (2) The y-axis here is showing values of the probability density function, which you can think of as frequency. Higher values mean more occurrences. The numbers themselves don’t matter as much as the line seen on the plot. The key feature of this plot is that the area underneath the dark black line equals 1.0 (1.0 in this case can be thought of as 100%). To determine the probability of an event occurring, the area under that portion of the curve equals the probability. Help us improve our content"

        "content": "Among the most basic questions about global warming is how much are human-produced greenhouse gases influencing the climate today compared to the past? To answer this question, NOAA developed the Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (\"AGGI\" for short). Updated yearly, the AGGI calculates the combined warming influence of the most important long-lived greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous dioxide, and a number of industrial chemicals used in cooling and refrigeration, aerosol sprays, and other processes. The total direct heating influence in a given year is compared to conditions in 1990—the year that countries who signed the U.N. Kyoto Protocol agreed to use as a benchmark for their efforts to reduce emissions. The AGGI—short for Annual Greenhouse Gas Index—reports the combined warming influence of all long-lived greenhouse gases as a fraction of their influence in 1990. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab. Most of the warming influence (64 percent) is due to carbon dioxide. Methane is the second-largest contributor (19 percent). The third-largest contributor is the (CFCs) category (8.1 percent). (CFCs were widely used in cooling systems and aerosol sprays in the mid-1900s, before we realized they damaged the ozone layer. These substances and their replacements are now regulated under the Montreal Protocol, but they are extremely long-lived in the atmosphere, so they continue to play a role in Earth's heating imbalance.) This graph shows the heating influence caused by the major human-produced greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (gray), methane (dark purple), nitrous oxide (medium purple), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, lavender), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs, blue), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs, light blue). Relative to conditions in 1750, today's atmosphere absorbs more than 3 extra watts of energy per square meter of Earth's surface. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov based on data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab. For the complete list of chemicals in the CFC, HFC, and HCFC groups, see Figure 3 in the Full AGGI Report.Graph by NOAA Climate.gov based on from NOAA ESRL. All gases that make up Earth’s atmosphere are largely transparent to incoming sunlight. Sunlight warms the ocean and land surfaces, and those sun-warmed surfaces radiate heat back into the atmosphere in response. The most abundant gases in the atmosphere, oxygen and nitrogen, are transparent to this outgoing heat (thermal infrared radiation), allowing it to travel freely out to space. But greenhouse gases are transparent to heat. They continually absorb heat energy and radiate it back into their surroundings—including back toward the Earth’s surface. Even after the Sun goes down, greenhouse gas molecules continue to radiate heat, like the bricks in a chimney radiate heat into a room even after a fire goes out. The ability of long-lived greenhouse gases to absorb and radiate heat is the heart of Earth's natural greenhouse effect. Without them, Earth's average surface temperature would be below freezing instead of around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, human activities have been adding heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere. By adding extra greenhouse gases, we are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect and causing Earth's surface temperature to rise. Overall, since 1990, human-produced greenhouse gases have increased the heating power of the atmosphere by 1.11 Watts per square meter, . Carbon dioxide is the big hitter, responsible for 78 percent of that increase. Changes in methane and —most of the latter comes from soil microbes when crops are over-fertilized—are each responsible for about 7.5 percent of the increase. The remainder of the increase is from HCFCs and HFCs, each accounting for around 4 percent of the increase. The heating influence from the CFCs group has decreased over time as their manufacture slowed thanks to the Montreal Protocol. Researchers in NOAA’s Global Monitoring Division calculate the AGGI using air samples collected every week at about 40 remote sites around the world. Technicians use state-of-the-art instruments to measure the abundance of greenhouse gases. From these observations, the researchers generate a smoothed global average. At the end of the year, the weekly data are combined into an annual average, which is then compared (indexed) to 1990. Indexing each year against 1990 makes it easier to compare one year to another. The year 1990 was chosen as the baseline year because it marked the first time that countries around the world seriously considered how they might work together to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases. Under the U.N. Kyoto Protocol, many industrialized nations around the world agreed to reduce their collective greenhouse gas emissions by about 5 percent of their 1990 amounts by 2012. Although the goals of this agreement have not been met, the year 1990 remains an important point of reference for efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. NOAA researchers have also calculated AGGI values back to the year 1750—the onset of the industrial revolution. To accomplish this, they used data on greenhouse gases concentrations estimated from air bubbles trapped in ice cores collected at a around the globe. Using these historic data provide a of humanity’s long-term influence on climate change. In , experts from NOAA's Global Monitoring Lab wrote, \"This longer-term view shows how increases in greenhouse gas concentrations over the past ~70 years (since 1950) have accounted for nearly three-fourths (71%) of the total increase in the AGGI over the past 270 years.\" Montzka, S.

        "content": "A blog about monitoring and forecasting El Niño, La Niña, and their regional and global impacts...but sometimes about other climate phenomena that influence seasonal climate. The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA ), with periodic guest contributors. Ideas and explanations found in these posts should be attributed to the ENSO blog team, and not to NOAA (the agency) itself. These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. It is well known that the surface has warmed over the past few decades, primarily in response to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. ENSO variability and other natural factors, have additionally contributed toward year-to-year fluctuations about this warming trend (dark red line in Figure 1). Strong El Niño events add a few tenths of a degree Celsius to the global average surface temperatures. However, there has recently been an observed slowing in the rate of surface warming (compare the red and orange trend lines in Figure 1) which may be related in part to a compared to previous decades (see ). Figure 1: Observed changes in global annual average surface temperature relative to 1961-1990 from the which is ( ). The temperature difference is compared with 1961-1990 average using data from Cowtan & Way (2014). The rate of warming from 1970-2013 (red trend line) is larger than the rate of warming between 1998-2013 (orange line). On its own, though, ENSO is only part of the story, and it cannot fully explain how and why extra heat trapped by rising greenhouse gas concentrations is unable to raise surface temperatures; recent research indicates that, if anything, the Earth is . How can warming at Earth’s surface have slowed when energy accumulation is becoming larger? The role of our oceans is central in answering this. As greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise, infra-red radiative cooling by the surface and the atmosphere (1) to space becomes less effective. This sends the planet out of balance, with more energy arriving through absorbed sunlight than leaving through infra-red radiation. Or to put simply, more energy stays on our planet than leaves, which results in the Earth warming. The heating effect is modified by knock-on effects which amplify or reduce climate change through vicious cycles or \"feedbacks.\" For example, . This enhances the strength of the greenhouse effect, and therefore the overall heating effect, still further. Inexorable have driven a radiative imbalance leading to global warming at the surface, which has been amplified by the associated increases in atmospheric moisture. These processes are crucial in explaining . While ENSO influences Earth's overall heating rate and global surface temperatures from year to year (Figures 1-2), what explains the diminishing rate of surface warming over the longer period from the 1990s to the 2000s? A number of (which make the planet reflect more sunlight) and a slightly in the 2000s compared to the late 1990s are thought to have effect of rising greenhouse gas concentrations. However, our of satellite data, ocean measurements and detailed simulations (see Figure 2) indicates that Earth's heating rate has not diminished over the period 1985-2012. And if anything it has increased. Currently at a rate approximately equivalent to every person worldwide using . That's a big tea party. Figure 2: Changes in Earth's yearly average heating rate in observations and simulations 1985-2013 (adapted from ). Shown here are an average of 9 simulations which applied observed surface temperatures and were adjusted to match the observed average heating rate over the 2005-2010 period. Earth loses heat following large volcanic eruptions such as Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 which injected aerosol particles into the stratosphere, reflecting more of the incoming sunlight back to space. Also important are changes in ocean circulation associated with ENSO: during the strongest El Niño events, such as 1997/8, warm ocean surface waters heat the atmosphere and more thermal infra-red radiation is emitted to space (there is a lag between the peak of the El Niño and the decrease in the heating rate of the planet) . Conversely, during La Niña events colder conditions in the east Pacific generally lead to a reduced rate at which energy is lost from the global oceans causing a greater overall heating rate of the planet (see above). As we all know from boiling up a pan of vegetables for dinner, you have to put in quite a bit of energy to raise the temperature of water: approximately 4,000 Joules to heat a kilogram of water by 1 degree Celsius. And it turns out that Earth's capacity to take up heat is primarily determined by our vast oceans, all 1.4 billion billion tons of them (1.4×10 kg) (2). But only the upper layers of the ocean are well mixed over the course of a year or a decade. Exchanging energy between the surface layers and the deep sea (defined here as depths below 700 meters (2,300 feet)) can be a glacially slow processes for much of ocean. Observations and simulations demonstrate that (in fact, a indicates that observed warming in the upper 700 meters, shown in Figure 3, has been underestimated in the Southern hemisphere due to the sparse distribution of measurements). Some parts of the deep abyss (down below 4 kilometres, or 2.5 miles) and cannot detect a significant warming and associated contribution to sea level rise from layers deeper than 2000 meters (1.2 miles); many parts of the deep oceans are apparently still blissfully unaware that anything untoward is occurring at the surface! Figure 3: Top: Depth-averaged temperature trends (in degrees Celsius per decade) in the upper 700 metres of the ocean for 1971-2010 (colours). Bottom: Observed warming rate (in degrees Celsius per decade) in the upper 700 metres of the ocean averaged over lines of latitude for the period 1971-2010 (colours) with average ocean temperature also shown (black contour lines in degrees Celsius) [Source: , ]. Variability in ocean circulation associated with ENSO generally affects the way heat is mixed in the upper few hundred metres of the ocean (a recent indicates that 85% of the year to year variability in sea level change due to thermal expansion of the upper 2000m of the ocean is explained by the upper 700m depth). indicates that , operating over longer timescales and at greater depth than the circulation changes associated with ENSO, are stealing some of the heat from the surface layers, thereby depriving the atmosphere of the warmth from the ocean surface. Changes in the and oceans have been implicated as prime suspects. , blowing from east to west associated with a La Niña-like , have been linked to a well-studied decade to decade variability called the . This the driving force in . It has recently been suggested, however, that the as part of a change in the global ocean circulation, causing accelerated heat uptake at . These ocean basins are fully interconnected and recent unusual changes in the tropics also influence weather patterns in remote locations such as across and which are connected by “bridges” in the atmosphere. In such a complicated system it can, however, be all too easy to conclude that . It has been long appreciated that surface temperatures will not rise smoothly in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations; other heating and cooling factors including , and influence Earth's overall heating rate. And natural fluctuations within our vast oceans from one decade to the next determine what proportion of that heat warms the surface layers and what part is gobbled up by deeper levels. While a lot of the focus on ocean circulation revolves around ENSO, it is important to note there is much more that goes on within the vast oceans that can affect our climate. A further intriguing question is Plus, it is yet to be established whether the unusual circulation patterns of the atmosphere and ocean part of a natural fluctuation or whether greenhouse gas forcing has also played a role in unusual oceanic conditions. Understanding these processes is vital in associated with human activities, important for how we plan for and adapt to future climatic change. These are important topics of research being tackled by hundreds of scientists worldwide as detailed in the latest comprehensive assessment by the and as documented by the growing pile of steadily accumulating... just like heat in the oceans. (1) In order to stay in energy balance, the earth must emit energy equal to that which is absorbed from the sun. The process in which the Earth’s surface and atmosphere emit energy back to space is referred to as i as our planet is “losing” heat. Greenhouse gases act to reduce the amount of energy that is emitted back to space by Earth, leaving more heat within the atmosphere, land and, in particular, the oceans, resulting in an imbalance as more energy from the sun is absorbed by the Earth than is emitted back to space. (2) If the heat currently accumulating was distributed evenly throughout the oceans, the temperatures of the entire ocean, including the sea surface, would rise by a paltry 0.017 degrees Celsius each decade. Observations show that the Earth is heating at and since the global surface area is , the buildup of energy is about 3×10 Joules per second which is 9.5×10 Joules per decade. Making a rough approximation, assuming the specific heat capacity of sea water is about 3,900 Joules per kg per degrees Celsius and the this would mean that it would take 5.5×10 Joules (5.5 trillion trillion Joules) to heat the entire ocean by 1 degrees Celsius (1.8 degrees F). Then we simply divide the heating rate (9.5×10 Joules per decade) by 5.5×10 Joules per degrees Celsius to get 0.017 degrees Celsius per decade (so it would take about 600 years to raise the temperature by 1 degrees Celsius).

Shades of red indicate where temperatures were warmer than average; shades of blue show where it was cooler than average. The darker the color, the larger the difference from average. During March 2013, most of the eastern United States was notably cooler than average, with the exception of New England. Along the Rockies, temperatures were closer to normal. Areas of the Southwest experienced above-average temperatures. Overall, the average temperature for the contiguous United States was 40.8° Fahrenheit, nearly 1° Fahrenheit below the twentieth-century average. Difference-from-average temperature maps are also known as temperature anomaly maps: they answer the question, \"Was it warmer or cooler than usual?\" In this case, \"usual\" means the long-term average temperature for the month of March, measured at stations across each of the 344 climate divisions of the contiguous United States from 1981 to 2010. Temperature records used to generate the map come from automated and volunteer-operated weather stations in each climate division. The departure-from-average values are calculated by averaging daily high and low temperatures reported for each climate division through the month, and subtracting this result from the division's long-term average monthly temperature. In places where temperatures were warmer than the long-term average, the result is positive, and the map shows the division in a shade of red. Places where temperatures were cooler than the long-term average yield a negative result, and are shown in shades of blue. The larger the anomaly, whether warm or cold, the more vivid the color. Climate divisions where temperatures observed through the month averaged out to a value near their long-term average temperature are white or nearly white. These climate statistics and many others are part of NOAA’s .

Clouds are of abiding interest to scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration because they are so important in shaping the Earth’s climate. Citizens have long contributed to scientific studies of clouds. Since 1994, the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program has been engaging students around the world in observing and reporting about clouds. Since 1997, NASA’s Students’ Cloud Observations Online (or S’COOL) Project has used cloud observations by students from every continent to verify findings by a NASA cloud-observing satellite. These two projects are now joining forces in a GLOBE/S’COOL partnership to sponsor cloud observation campaigns by citizen scientists. Participants in the projects observe clouds as a NASA satellite passes overhead, using a one-page form to record their observations. Then they report that data to NASA or GLOBE through a Web form. Participants can make and report observations at any time, whenever schedules permit. Observations reported to S’COOL are matched with satellite data, where applicable, within about a week. Observers then receive a return email inviting them to analyze the comparison between the two points of view. Both the GLOBE and S’COOL websites include information about the project, about clouds, and about the importance of understanding this highly variable aspect of the Earth system. Plans are in development to merge the two projects during fiscal year 2016 to create a single resource for citizen science observation of clouds.

Building the capacity of students and teachers have been shown to have the greatest cost-benefit value for adaptation to climate change (Lutz et al. 2014). But while education can be one of the most efficient mechanism for changing individuals and communities climate related actions and improving climate literacy, it is still emerging how to best deliver it (Mochizuki and Bryan 2015). While many education programs around the world have done an excellent job building students’ knowledge around the causes of climate change, limited evidence exists that this knowledge is sufficient to change the actions responsible for climate change (Eilam and Trop 2012). Ironically, it is often the most educated that lead the most carbon intensive lifestyles, suggesting it is not more education that is needed, but different education. As this different and more effective educational practice is developed, educators and program developers can connect with others to share what works. The diverse professional networks above in step 5 are places where this new form of education is already being developed. Figure 3: ASU/MOS Communities are stepping up to address climate change impacts, serving as the primary incubators of social innovation and generating new strategies for sustainable living.

        "content": "Some explorers and pioneers described daily weather in handwritten journals and logbooks. These served as a record of weather in one place, but they were only rarely gathered or compared to understand regional conditions. In the early 1800s, an Army physician who wanted to understand how weather affected the health of the troops initiated a systematic effort to collect weather data. He had soldiers at army posts across the country observe and record their daily weather and send their records to a central location. This effort eventually resulted in more than twenty years of weather records for a large part of the United States. In 1891, the task of monitoring weather was transferred from the military to a civilian corps, creating the agency we now call the National Weather Service (NWS). As reliable, affordable weather instruments and methods for recording and storing data improved, people began to collect and share their weather records. Scientific organizations established standard instruments and procedures for weather-observing stations and develop systems to collect the information. One example of weather data collected at Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Click the image for a larger view. Observers and automated stations record and submit raw data to NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) on a daily or monthly schedule. Meteorologists at NCEI use computers to perform a basic check of all incoming data. Computer programs check the patterns in each data record for any signs of malfunctioning equipment or systemic errors such as those shown below. The top left graph shows a common pattern of mid-morning temperatures measured every 5 minutes. The remaining panels show data patterns that may indicate a disturbance or a problem with the instruments. Data records that show these types of artifacts are flagged and excluded from further processing when calculating climate. Weather data are also checked for consistency across a region. Scientists check data sets from comparable stations to see if the data makes sense for the region and time of year. For example: does one station report sunshine and warm temperatures while a neighboring station shows sub-zero temperatures and clouds? If they find inconsistencies, meteorologists methodically track down the source of the inconsistent data. At this point, original data values may be flagged as incorrect, and excluded from further processing, but they are never changed or edited, unless the error was due to incorrect transcriptions by volunteers. Once weather data has passed quality control, it becomes part of the larger data record. The data can then be processed to generate climate products such as maps and graphs. Over time, records of weather observations help us understand the long-term conditions at each location. Animation showing maximum daily temperature (\"afternoon highs\") at Washington National Airport for 1 year, 3 years, and 30 years. In the frame showing 30 years of data, the scattering of individual dots (weather) becomes a broad swath that marks the long-term range of maximum temperatures (climate). Animation by NOAA Climate.gov. (zip folder). Climate scientists quantify long-term average conditions for each date of the year by calculating the average (mean) of observed temperature, precipitation, humidity, and others. At the beginning of every new decade, NOAA scientists calculate official for the previous three decades. These average values are the “normal” against which we compare our daily weather. Climate Normals help us answer the question: “How does today's weather compare to average conditions over the previous three decades?” The most common processing steps used to turn daily weather data into climate data products involve straightforward mathematics. Operations such as adding and averaging turn weather data into climate information. For instance, a station's daily average (mean) temperature is calculated by averaging the minimum and maximum temperatures for the day: daily average = (minimum + maximum) / 2. As another example, a station's average monthly maximum temperature is calculated by averaging all the daily maximum temperatures observed during the month. For precipitation data, the most common processing step is adding: for instance, monthly precipitation values are calculated by adding the depths of precipitation from each day over the entire month. The purple line connects annual average temperatures observed at Blue Hill, Massachusetts from 1885 to 2018. Each annual average was calculated from a full year of daily averages of minimum and maximum temperatures. For comparison, the horizontal black line shows the overall average temperature at the station from 1901 to 2000. Image source: , NOAA. To understand climate on larger scales, climatologists average data from individual stations with data from other stations in the area. When combining observations, the values for each station are mathematically weighted to account for the fraction of the averaging area they represent. This keeps areas with many weather stations from being overrepresented compared to areas with fewer stations. Climate products produced from databases of observations include reports, maps, and graphics such as monthly . These data also serve as input for computer models to help generate future climate outlooks and weather forecasts. Current weather and climate data are used in many ways. People who make decisions for cities and towns rely on accurate and easy-to-understand graphs and maps to assist them in planning for energy needs, water management, and extreme weather events. Local climate data are also used to determine city budgets for maintaining roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. Climate data are used by people across many sectors of our economy. For example, farmers use climate data to select which crops to grow, while water managers use climate data to know when to release water from reservoirs. . Following consistent procedures at every step—from making weather observations to publishing climate products—ensures that NOAA’s climate information is accurate and reliable.

        "content": "Spring blooms at Longwood Gardens. Photo by Andrea Poe, When several grand sugar maples at the famous Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania succumbed to disease recently, grounds manager Shawn Kister wondered if warm winters were to blame. Some plant diseases are stopped by cold, he knew, and others are encouraged by longer warm periods. Sugar maples like the cold, and Longwood is already at the southern edge of their historical range. A few hundred miles south, Charlotte-based TV meteorologist John Ahrens noticed that area rainfall had remained lower than normal for several years. The farmers and landscapers around Charlotte were compensating with more irrigation, but those systems are expensive. What was going on? Was this going to be the new normal? Gardeners, meteorologists, businesses, weather junkies and others will get answers to some of these questions in July, when NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) releases the latest version of an official weather product called the U.S. Climate Normals. Updated each decade, the U.S. Climate Normals are 30-year averages of many pieces of weather information collected from thousands of weather stations nationwide. Each time they are updated, an old decade is dropped, and a new one added. Starting in July, when you hear that a day was hotter, or colder, or rainier than normal, that \"normal\" will be a little different from what it was in the past. Across much of the country, overnight low temperatures in January are as much as several degrees warmer in the 1981–2010 Normals than they were in the 1971-2000 version (left). Meanwhile, the average maximum temperatures in July are actually cooler across some parts of the country (right). This time around, the 30-year window for the U.S. Climate Normals is 1981-2010: the decade 1971-1980 was dropped, and 2001-2010 was added. Since the '70s were an unusually cool decade, while 2001-2010 was the warmest ever recorded, it is not surprising that the average temperature rose for most locations. For the United States as a whole, it was not daytime highs (maximum temperatures) but overnight lows (minimum temperatures) that rose the most compared with the 1970s. Many areas of the country—parts of the Great Plains, the Mississippi Valley, and the Northeast—actually had cooler July maximum average temperatures in the 2001-2010 time period compared to 30 years earlier; summer picnics in Missouri may have been less sweltering. At night, though, except for the southeasternmost part of the country, minimum temperatures in January were warmer. When temperatures were averaged for the entire year, every state came out warmer overall. On a state-by-state basis, the annual average minimum (left) and maximum (right) temperatures across the United States are warmer in the 1981-2010 Climate Normals than in the 1971-2000 version. The observations that go into the U.S. Climate Normals come from the National Weather Service's network of Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) stations, numbering in the thousands; a smaller network of \"first order\" stations maintained by professionals in the National Weather Service or Federal Aviation Administration, numbering in the hundreds; and more than one hundred NOAA Climate Reference Network stations established in the past decade. Rainfall data are collected from than 8,000 stations, while temperature comes from about 6,000 stations. Some of the data are collected and reported automatically by instruments, while most of the measurements are collected manually each day by volunteers. Once a decade, a team at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center calculates the U.S. Climate Normals from these millions of bits of raw data. The U.S. Climate Normals draw on precipitation measurements from several thousand stations located across the country. NOAA map by Ned Gardiner, based on data from the . NOAA scientist Anthony Arguez is the U.S. Climate Normals project manager. \"Our job,\" he says, \"is to take the data values as collected by the National Weather Service, apply robust quality control and standardization to improve the fidelity in our products, and use sophisticated statistical techniques that result in high-quality normals of temperature, precipitation, snowfall, and derived quantities such as heating and cooling degree days.\" The chart shows a range of variables—temperature, precipitation, wind speed, snowfall, and more—that factor into U.S. climate normals. Based on feedback from user groups such as power companies, National Climatic Data Center scientists have added some new information into the U.S. Climate Normals product suite, such as hourly temperatures and month- or year-to-date precipitation. The data can be accessed by anyone who wants to use them, such as television stations, water managers, insurance and energy companies, meteorologists, or emergency planners. The general methods for calculating climate normals were established back in the 1930s by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and they are still followed by the United States and many nations all over the world. The consistency means that the U.S. Climate Normals are part of a reliable, long-term data record that can be used for studying natural climate patterns and climate change. The information also helps people understand what conditions they can expect wherever they may live. Longwood Garden's Shawn Kister is not the only public garden expert wondering about a shifting climate. \"Longer periods of warm weather affect plants in many ways,\" says Mac Franklin, the head gardener of the North Carolina Arboretum, who in April is already sporting a farmer's tan. \"It can mean less water in the soil,\" he explains, \"and then the rain we do get can't seep into the ground as easily. Longer warm periods can lengthen the pest season and allow for more generations of pests,\" such as aphids. Pests are also able to thrive and spread in forests and other natural landscapes at least in part because of warmer nights. Both the native which has ravaged forests from Colorado to Alaska, and the introduced which has been sucking the life out of hemlocks in the East, may be benefiting from warmer nights, especially in winter. of standing dead trees—pine beetle damage—in a patch of forest in the mountains near Granby, Colorado. Warmer winters are allowing the destructive insect to thrive. The pine beetle has infested 1.5 million acres of lodgepole pine in Colorado. With warmer nights, fire season is longer. Pollination patterns may be changing. A study sponsored by Longwood Gardens showed that flowering plants have been blooming an average of one day earlier each decade. Warmer nights and later onset of freezing days also means that plants can generally survive farther north than they used to. Changes in U.S. climate-related planting zones between the 1971-2000 Normals and the 1981-2010 Normals. Many places' coldest temperatures of the year grew warmer between the two periods, leading to a shift in plant hardiness zones. NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NCEI. Explore an North Carolina Arboretum Director George Briggs offers this advice to gardeners facing a shifting climate: \"If they are climate-literate they can put risk management into their decision making, make their design specifications more conservative.\" \"Public gardens have to balance costs, benefits and risk,\" says Briggs. \"It's a more complex decision matrix with these shifts. Will gardens have to beef up their sewer systems to account for ? How much irrigation to put in? Where once you needed just enough to establish the landscape, now there may be a continuing need for water, or maybe you put in more conservative plants that are more water-efficient.\" To help garden visitors make sense of all these changes, the American Public Gardens Association is creating a cell phone tour about climate. At Longwood Gardens, the tour will begin in the managed meadow close to a still-surviving grand old sugar maple. A surviving sugar maple overlooks a managed meadow at Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania. The tree is the first stop on a cell phone tour of the garden that explains the potential impacts of climate change on plants. \"There is telling evidence that climate change is affecting plant life around the world and here at Longwood,\" says Paul Redman, Longwood's Director. \"Sharing the important work of NOAA with our staff, guests, and community is integral to our mission and continues Longwood Gardens' commitment to environmental stewardship.\" As for the U.S. Climate Normals, the team at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville will continue to release additional products over the coming months. These will include agricultural normals such as Frost/Freeze Dates, and population-weighted normals such as Heating and Cooling Degree Days. In the meantime, new data are being collected every day, at thousands of stations nationwide, that will eventually become part of the 1991-2020 U.S. Climate Normals, due for release in another ten years.

And of course, the Rockies or the Sierra Nevada Mountains. These are the parts of the United States where weather history suggests you want to be if you're looking for the best chance of a white Christmas. This map shows the historic probability of there being at least 1 inch of snow on the ground at weather stations across the United States on December 25 based on the latest (1991-2020) from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Using those station data, experts interpolated values for all locations in the Lower 48. ( means estimating values where you don’t have direct observations, using existing observations and physical relationships, such as the way temperature changes with altitude.) Darkest gray shows places where the probability is less than 10%. (Sorry West Coast, Gulf Coast, Deep South!) White shows probabilities greater than 90 percent. The 1991–2020 Climate Normals are the latest three-decade averages of several climatological measurements. This collection contains daily and monthly Normals of temperature, precipitation, snowfall, heating and cooling degree days, frost/freeze dates, and growing-degree days calculated from observations at nearly 15,000 stations, the majority of which are operated by operated by NOAA National Weather Service. While the map shows the historical probability that at least 1 inch of snow will be observed on December 25, the actual conditions in any year may vary widely from these because the weather patterns present will determine the snow on the ground or snowfall on Christmas day. These probabilities are useful as a guide only to show where snow on the ground is more likely. For prediction of your actual weather on Christmas, check out your local forecast at . Long-time readers of Climate.gov will know that this map is an update of originally made by NCEI experts using data from the 1981-2010 U.S. Climate Normals. If you’re tempted to compare the two maps for signs of the influence of long-term warming, keep a few things in mind. First, comparing two adjacent Normals periods is not the most direct way to look for climate change. From one 30-year Normals period to the next, two decades of the data are the same; only one decade out of three is new. This gradual introduction of a single decade of new data means that most changes from one Normals period to the next will be relatively small compared to the trend between the oldest decade and the most recent decade. It also means that at some locations, changes could be the result of natural decadal variability. Second, there are plenty of places in the U.S. where the temperature in late December is frequently well below freezing. Monthly or annual average air temperatures in those areas could be warming over the long-term—and they are, for —without causing a noticeable decline in the chance of snow on any given late December day at any given location. Snow cover on a specific day of a specific year is largely a product of day-to-day weather systems, rather than long term climate trends. All that said, however, the spatial fingerprints of climate change that we’d expect based on our modelling studies are visible in national patterns of . So, it’s not surprising that there are some subtle differences between the 1981-2010 version of the white Christmas map and the 1991-2020 version that are consistent with the reality of long-term warming. More areas experienced decreases in their chances of a white Christmas than experienced increases. The easiest one to spot with the naked eye is the expansion of the dark gray area, where the chances of a white Christmas are less than 10%. The gray area shifted noticeably northward across the South, and upslope along the ocean-facing slopes of some of the West Coast mountain ranges. Beyond those broad strokes, local changes between the two maps would have to be carefully investigated and placed into context with other climate data and analysis techniques better suited for detecting long-term change.

        "content": "Maine’s Crooked River flows into Sebago Lake, the drinking water source for 52,000 household water customers who live in or near Portland, Maine. The lake is an ideal water supply—deep, cold, low in nutrients, and fed by mostly forested land in the Crooked River watershed. For as long as water from the lake meets strict quality standards, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has granted the Portland Water District a filtration avoidance waiver under the Safe Drinking Water Act, allowing it to avoid the cost of a built filtration plant.

In recent years, a confluence of several environmental changes has become a concern for the lake’s water quality. For example, the U.S. Forest Service determined that development pressure is putting some areas of the Sebago Lake watershed at high risk of forest conversion: coupled with unsustainable land use practices, conversion is a major threat to water quality. Upstream development, deforestation, and population growth in the area can all reduce water quality. And each factor is complicated by climate-related changes in precipitation and temperature patterns, including increased frequency of extreme precipitation events.

Community members were concerned that continuing changes could jeopardize the filtration waiver and force the Portland Water District to install a conventional filtration system—the level of concern reflected the estimated $100–150 million cost for the system. In response to the risk of incurring this expense, the community actively investigated alternatives that could minimize the chance of losing their filtration waiver or otherwise reduce their costs for water treatment.

To get a sense of economic trade-offs involved in the decision, and to identify data gaps and parameters that would need to be addressed for a more complete analysis, a collaborative group applied their expertise to complete the Green-Gray Analysis. The analysis compared the costs and benefits for two approaches to protect the water supply: natural (green) infrastructure and built (gray) infrastructure. Specifically, the method compared the cost of a new filtration plant with a 20-year investment in five forest-based, natural infrastructure elements that would help retain the existing high-quality waters of the Sebago Lake Watershed. The elements included riparian buffers, upgrades to culverts with a risk of failure in severe storm events, sustainability certification of future timber harvests, reforestation in riparian zones, and conservation easements. Given the uncertainty associated with the lack of underlying biophysical modeling, the method tested various scenarios under different assumptions regarding the efficacy of the natural infrastructure measures. The method also considered various cost estimates for initial and annual costs of the alternative investment portfolios. In the expected or baseline scenario, findings indicated the natural infrastructure option could realize savings of $12 million over 20 years—a result that didn't include the potential public benefits from increased carbon sequestration and enhanced Atlantic salmon habitat. Under an optimistic scenario, the natural infrastructure option would generate savings of up to $110 million. Preliminary results of the Green-Gray Analysis for two scenarios for Portland, Maine, indicated potential savings of $12 to $111 million by investing in green infrastructure rather than a membrane filtration system. NOAA Climate.gov graph via the . Under the least optimistic scenario—which assumes lower-bound cost estimates for the membrane filtration system, high use of costly conservation easements, and residual risk of waiver loss of 25 percent—the natural infrastructure option would represent a cost increase of up to 46 percent. Even with these pessimistic assumptions, results indicated the natural option would be economically superior when considering the full range of ancillary benefits. Based on a combination of empirical data on the ground and calibrated non-market benefits transferred from other settings, non-market benefits from carbon sequestration and enhanced Atlantic salmon habitat alone were estimated at $72 to $125 million over a 20-year time frame.

In 2013, based on the results of the assessment, the Portland Water District made the decision to invest in natural infrastructure to secure clean water in Sebago Lake. In order to accelerate land protection in the region, the utility pays up to 25 percent of the costs of conservation easement purchases. In 2014, execution of this policy amounted to $26,000, the utility’s largest conservation investment to date. The Green-Gray Analysis enabled decision makers at Portland Water District to compare projected financial and ecological costs for water treatment. As a result of the analysis, the utility integrated natural infrastructure into their water resource management efforts in ways that enhance their resilience to climate change, keep costs down, and provide co-benefits for communities and the environment. In recognizing that an integrated approach to securing clean drinking water and other watershed services is cost-effective and made sense ecologically, the Portland Water District made strides toward ensuring resiliency, sustainability, and water security for the region.

        "meta_description": "Heat waves bring some level of discomfort to nearly everyone. When excessive heat catches vulnerable populations off guard, that discomfort can advance to illness and even death. Public health officials in Minnesota are working to protect people in both rural and urban settings.",
        "content": "The long, hot days of summer come with outdoor activities and much needed vacation for many Americans. Public health officials, however, remain on high alert during the warm days: they are increasingly aware of the increased exposure to extreme heat that accompanies summertime activities and the threats faced by residents of buildings without air conditioning. They're also mindful of the need for extra protection of vulnerable populations during heat waves. Building resilience to extreme heat for the range of rural, urban, economically disadvantaged, and wealthy communities across an entire state presents a formidable challenge. While Minnesota is a state that is more commonly known for its frigid winters than its warm summers, it has occasionally experienced summer heat waves that linger for several days. In response, cities and towns across the state have taken strides to meet the challenge of protecting their residents when heat waves occur. Building on lessons learned over several summers, Kristin Raab—Health Impact Assessment and Climate Change Program Director in the Environmental Health Division of Minnesota’s Department of Health—packaged information from diverse communities into a cohesive toolkit that communities of all sizes can use to prepare for heat waves. The describes changing weather conditions in Minnesota, the magnitude of potential health consequences from extreme heat, and key steps communities can take to prevent heat-related illnesses and deaths. Decision makers can identify where to focus their resilience-building efforts by identifying where relatively high numbers of vulnerable people live.This map shows the percentage of the population below the poverty line by county. The darker the color the higher the percentage. Courtesy the Minnesota Department of Health. The toolkit acknowledges that extreme heat response plans will vary with the size of the community and the habits of its residents: examples from the mostly rural Olmsted County and the urban centers of Saint Paul and Minneapolis illustrate a range of community plans that could be useful in Minnesota and beyond. Olmsted County in southeastern Minnesota is home to a generally healthy, largely rural population. After a resident died during an excessive heat event in the early 2000s, though, Olmsted County’s Public Health Services reconsidered their emergency management plan and included provisions for extreme heat events. In 2010, for instance, the county offered access to centralized cooling centers during extremely hot days, but they found that residents did not take advantage of them. Planners went back to the drawing board to find simpler solutions to keep people cool. Today, when the NOAA National Weather Service issues an advisory or warning for an excessive heat event, public service announcements on radio and television stations in the county suggest that people who don’t have air conditioning head to cool locations—such as libraries, shopping centers, or senior centers. Additionally, the Mayor of Rochester, the county seat, may use discretion to offer free bus rides to those locations. As some people do not tune in to media, the county’s Health Services staff also distributes flyers through non-governmental organizations such as Meals on Wheels. Amy Evans, the County Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, and her team review their strategies each year and consider new ideas to protect residents. Saint Paul, Minnesota skyline. Photo Credit: Flickr user xnatedawgx via CC license. Saint Paul, the state capital, has different challenges: maps of census data show the city has a large population of people over the age of 65. Robert Einweck, the Health Protection Division Manager for Ramsey County, recognizes that this age group has fewer metabolic defenses from the ill effects of heat than the general population. He relies on both public officials and community partners to help protect older populations. The county pushes automated email messages to many of its service providers, encouraging them to contact vulnerable clients during heat events and get them to cool locations. This map shows the percentage of the population 65 years or older by county. The darker the color the higher the percentage. Courtesy the Minnesota Department of Health. To protect the full range of residents in the county, the Health Protection Division also provides maps highlighting locations where people can access air conditioning. They show public facilities such as libraries, as well as privately owned settings such as shopping malls and cinemas. And when heat waves occur, the Mayor’s office often authorizes extended hours for pools and recreation centers. Einweck and colleagues also developed a translation system, called ECHO, that provides emergency warnings in Spanish, Hmong, and Somali so that language isn’t an obstacle to effective outreach and communication. Pam Blixt, Emergency Preparedness Manager in the neighboring, larger “twin city” of Minneapolis, was a co-creator of ECHO. Blixt is working with her department’s staff meteorologist to shift their warning system from simple measures of heat to a measurement that incorporates humidity and, therefore, the intensity of heat exposure. Her suggestion is to monitor “wet bulb” temperature, the same measure the U.S. military monitors while conducting military exercises. To support this improvement, Hennepin County has deployed a network of sensors to supplement official NOAA weather stations so that higher-resolution measures of temperature and humidity are available in real time. Hennepin County's highlights locations where residents can go to cool down. Libraries, community centers, and shopping malls are shown on the map. Blixt’s department also developed a mobile app that encapsulates many of the strategies that smaller communities use, including maps of cool places people can go during heat waves. Their notification network includes over 500 agencies and organizations that deliver services throughout the community. Broadcast meteorologists in Minneapolis also help spread educational information before and during heat waves. Additionally, the city’s extreme heat website provides information, such as a list of medications that may increase the effects of extreme heat, descriptions that can help people recognize the signs of heat sickness, and emergency contact numbers. One conclusion from government agencies of all sizes is that good communication with NOAA’s forecast offices is an essential first step to preparing for extreme heat events. The National Weather Service is the key source of information that catalyzes a cascade of varying responses, and those responses vary depending on the size of the community where they are implemented. The Minnesota Department of Health’s Extreme Heat Toolkit includes adaptation examples and a draft response plan to help health officials and emergency managers beat the heat.

Morgan Stewart, The Day, courtesy of Peg Van Patten. In 2015, in response to climate change projections, the town began working with staff from the Environmental Protection Agency's Region 1 to assess infrastructure for their water supply. Of particular concern was the potential for contamination of drinking water from saltwater intrusion and sea level rise. Town officials also considered the potential for more severe weather and flooding, which could carry waste and hazardous materials into the water supply. The team mapped the locations of critical infrastructure, and then overlaid maps showing which parts of town flooded, and how deeply, during previous hurricanes. Using a developed by NOAA, the project also evaluated how projected sea level rise due to global warming would increase the extent and depth of flooding during a Category 2 or Category 4 hurricane. The mapping efforts inspired the idea for a disaster-preparedness initiative. Town leaders gathered a coalition of community members from across sectors and generations. This team—dubbed Weather Ready Mattapoisett—included local Boy Scouts, the city librarian, the television station, educators, the Council on Aging, and the town mascot Salty the Seahorse. Together, they developed a message and came up with ways to get it out to the community in a cohesive and recognizable campaign. Gathering information and testimonies from survivors of the previous storms was a major part of the project. Organizers issued a call for videos, stories, and pictures from past extreme events. The library collected and digitized the information, and then shared it with Old Rochester Cable TV, the local cable television station. About a dozen residents provided more than 120 items. Survivors’ interviews were recorded and edited into short stories and shared on the project’s local website. Photos of flooding from past storms were displayed alongside current images of the town in “Mattapoisett Then and Now,” an exhibit that remains in the library. One local Boy Scout contributed to the effort as part of his Eagle Scout Project, creating the Flood Marker Trail. Signs and bands fixed to utility poles throughout the city mark the extent of the past floods.

The town manager describes the project and survivor’s stories as shocking to visitors. These activities help reveal how damaging a severe hurricane can be to those who have never experienced one, and encourage residents and visitors to take emergency preparedness seriously. The campaign doesn't stop with raising awareness of how to stay safe during a storm—it also addresses issues that can affect community members’ safety after the event. The release of hazardous materials into the drinking water supply, the backup of wastewater into homes, and heightened risk of explosion from damage to fuel tanks are some potential post-storm hazards. To help residents understand the range of potential issues related to strong storms, the town produced a . It explains how to get information about extreme weather, create a communication plan, and prepare homes to reduce the risk of hazardous materials and sewer backups.

The town also hosted a community “Prepare-A-Thon,” where participants were able to get this information in greater detail and learn more about the work of the Weather Ready Mattapoisett team. The project began sharing their messages with the public in 2016, and the combined efforts of private and public partners appears to be paying off. The group acted definitively, using their past experiences to better prepare for their future. By educating themselves on past storms and preparing for future storms, the community is more resilient. Weather Ready Mattapoisett helped the community set itself up to prevent water contamination, release of toxic chemicals, and loss of human life in the face of future storms.

        "content": "Climate change is exacerbating the major factors that lead to wildfire: heat, drought, and dead trees. The West is particularly vulnerable to such fires. Between 1970 and 2003, warmer and drier conditions increased burned area in western U.S. mid-elevation conifer forests by 650 percent. As noted in the 2014 National Climate Assessment, from 1916 to 2003 climate outweighed other factors in determining burned area in the western United States. The projected increase in the number of “very large fire\" weeks—weeks in which conditions are favorable to the occurrence of very large fires—by mid-century (2041-2070) compared to the recent past (1971-2000). Projections are based on the possible emissions scenario known , which assumes continued increases in carbon dioxide emissions. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from Barbera , 2015. Experts project that wildfires will become even more frequent as climate change continues; projections include a doubling of burned area in the southern Rockies, and up to 74 percent more fires in . Such wildfires pose significant dangers to hospitals’ abilities to serve their communities. As wildfires encroach, hospitals can be forced to evacuate, even if the fire itself is not near the building. Hospital ventilation systems require a fresh supply of outdoor air to maintain indoor air quality and pressurization; if outdoor air is contaminated by heavy smoke, it may be impossible to safely house patients and staff in the building. A large plume of smoke is seen rising from the North Fork fire in Jefferson County, CO, in 2012. Photo courtesy . During wildfires, however, hospital emergency departments near the fire must remain operational to treat firefighters and affected community residents. To deal with smoke risks, hospitals in fire-prone areas can isolate emergency department ventilation systems and enable recirculated air during emergency conditions. In addition, portable air scrubbers or HEPA (high-efficiency particulate arresting) filters can be placed in various units to capture smoke, fumes, and airborne particles if outdoor ventilation systems must be shut down. In 2008, southern California experienced two major wildfires: the Sesnon Fire in October lasted five days and the Sayre fire in November lasted six days. The Sesnon blaze posed a major threat to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center by engulfing the facility in smoke. Later, the Sayre fire was more intense, crossing a highway and preventing 40 percent of Providence’s staff from reaching the facility. Driven by powerful Santa Ana winds, this NASA satellite image from October 13, 2008, shows smoke from the wildfires that raged near Los Angeles. Image courtesy . As it is the only local area trauma center in Burbank, Providence received more than 200 patients from neighboring hospitals and had to cancel all elective surgeries. Providence was able to stay open and operational through both fires, thanks in large part to its use of HEPA filters. The medical center had purchased these filters earlier for pandemic flu preparedness. The filters purify the air in a way that facilitates the central ventilation system maintaining zero pressures (critical for quarantine rooms). In this case, however, using the equipment for a different purpose enabled the hospital to remain open and functional during a fire event.

In June 2013, the Black Forest fire in Colorado forced the evacuation or pre-evacuation of approximately 300 employees of Memorial Hospital and Children’s Hospital Colorado from their homes. When Memorial Hospital received reports of the encroaching fire, the administrators immediately began preparing based on the hospital’s previous experience with the Waldo Canyon fire in 2012. Memorial’s Safety and Facilities departments began “environmental rounds,” monitoring air quality in the buildings.

        "content": "Flooding of the Red River of the North has repeatedly devastated homes and businesses in and around Moorhead, Minnesota, and Fargo, North Dakota. From 2009 to 2011 alone, three major floods caused more than $1 billion dollars in damage, impacting the lives and livelihoods of people across the region. An area of Fargo, ND, is flooded by the Red River of the North in March 2009. Public Domain Photo Courtesy Patsy Lynch, FEMA. As climate scientists project the frequency and intensity of flooding events to increase in many areas due to climate change, homeowners, businesses, and municipalities across the Red River Valley are eager for tools and information that can help them avoid damage and recover more quickly when flooding does occur. Riverine flood forecasts from the National Weather Service’s North Central River Forecast Center (NCRFC) provide solid information for flood emergency planning efforts. For instance, emergency managers can view graphs showing estimated height and timing of high water at various points along a river. Though these officials understand how to convert cubic feet per second (cfs) of Tailwater, Pool, or In-flow Discharge on flood forecast graphs into maps showing areas that may be affected by flooding, the full range of folks who might be impacted by the event can't tell by looking at the graphs if they should expect flooding. In response to the high frequency of flooding impacts, leaders in the region created the (RRBDIN). A screenshot of the RRBDIN’s Flood Forecast Display Tool. This network facilitates collaboration among various entities, enabling them to develop and offer tools that can improve resiliency to flooding. One such collaboration is a public-private, nonprofit partnership among the North Central River Forecast Center (NCRFC), the International Water Institute, and Houston Engineering Inc. Members of this group gathered a range of specific data to help residents prepare for flooding, and then packaged it into a web-based visualization tool called the Flood Forecast Display Tool (FFDT). In 2009, Dave DeMuth, a resident of Moorhead, Minnesota, consulted the FFDT’s interactive map to display visualizations of the flood forecast generated by the NCRFC. He examined an inundation map, an inundation depth grid, and graphics depicting the estimated arrival time of the flood’s peak as well as flow conditions in and around the region for the flood forecast period. Using information from the tool, he was able to estimate peak crest height, timing, and the sandbag count needed to protect resources in advance of the flood. A line of volunteers moves sandbags to construct a dike in Fargo, ND, in March 2009. Photo Courtesy Adam Quartarolo, used via CC license. Armed with this information, DeMuth interacted with homeowners who were forecast to be impacted and discussed strategies for fighting the flood. The FFDT helped him estimate the amount of time, number of people, and funds it would take to fill the number of sandbags needed to protect various assets. This vital information helped many residents protect their homes and businesses in 2009 and again in 2010. Private residents, emergency responders, agricultural producers, and small businesses can also use the FFDT to get a sense of how they may be impacted before flooding occurs. For example, agricultural producers in the Red River Valley can access the tool during spring runoff events to visualize if and when their lands are likely to be inundated by floodwaters. This information empowers them to choose and implement adaptive strategies that increase the resiliency of their operations. Private residents can search for their address and access visualizations that show the extent of inundation expected in their neighborhoods. They can also use the Sandbag Calculator to estimate the number of sandbags they will need to protect homes and businesses. Sandbags block off flooding.

The FFDT continues to provide valuable information to people in the Red River Valley during flooding, and serves as a successful example of a public-private partnership that applies emerging web-based technologies to encourage resilient responses to flooding. Additionally, the partnership plans to continue improving the tool: by incorporating NCRFC ensemble stream forecasts, they plan to offer probabilities that an area will be inundated, similar to the format weather forecasters use when predicting chances for rain or snow.

        "content": "Shelved in 2001, the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite is finally ready for its time in the spotlight, or more accurately, the sunlight. On February 11, DSCOVR began its million-mile journey to Lagrange point 1 (or L1 orbit), an orbital sweet spot between Earth and the Sun. There, gravitational forces between the Sun and Earth are perfectly balanced, and the satellite will orbit the Sun like a planet. Lagrange point 1 (L1) is a neutral gravity point between Earth and the Sun, situated roughly 1 million miles from Earth. Most Earth-observing satellites orbit within 22,300 miles of the planet. Credit: . The satellite's primary mission is monitoring space weather, but it is also carrying a critical climate-science instrument: a radiation monitor that will measure the amount of energy reflected from and radiated by Earth. The new device, nicknamed NISTAR, will give scientists the most exact measurements they've ever had of the amount of energy being trapped in Earth's atmosphere by greenhouse gases. An artist’s rendering of the DSCOVR satellite. Credit: . At the most basic level, Earth’s temperature is determined by its energy balance: how much solar energy (total solar irradiance) is received at the top of Earth's atmosphere, minus the amount the atmosphere and surface reflect and radiate back into space as heat (outgoing longwave radiation). The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the slower the heat escapes, and the more Earth’s surface warms. The uneven distribution of land, ocean, and sea ice on our planet’s surface—not to mention continuously changing cloud cover—make estimating the exact amount of radiant energy emitted and reflected by our planet very difficult. Satellites have been measuring Earth’s energy budget since the NIMBUS missions of the mid-1970s. However, stitching a complete time series together from the collection of sensors that observe different parts of Earth from different angles at different times of day has been challenging. NISTAR (short for National Institute of Standards & Technology Advanced Radiometer) will change all that. The data collected by NISTAR, measured from the vantage point of the L1 orbit, will provide measurements from the whole sunlit face of Earth at once. “The NISTAR radiometer will measure the reflected and radiated energy from Earth in the important direction back towards the Sun. We have other satellites that measure these quantities at other directions. [But those satellites] have to orbit around Earth, spending only a portion of their orbits in the light,” said Adam Szabo, DSCOVR Project Scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. “The advantage of NISTAR is that it observes the whole sunlit face of Earth. Thus we do not have to worry about intercalibrations between different measurements from different platforms.” NISTAR is a cavity radiometer. As it sits between Earth and the Sun, it works by absorbing any electromagnetic radiation that falls within its aperture. This energy heats up the cavity and raises the machine’s internal temperature. When the cavity heats up, the device’s onboard heaters don’t have to work as hard to maintain a constant internal temperature. Scientists can infer the amount of energy reflected and radiated by Earth by measuring variations in the amount of electricity the heaters draw. TOP: DSCOVR Mission's NIST Advanced Radiometer. BOTTOM: Location of NISTAR on the DSCOVR satellite (in orange). Photo Courtesy: NASA. Climate scientists have two main ways of estimating Earth’s energy budget. One is the direct observations of incoming and outgoing energy captured by satellites over the past three decades. The other way is to infer how much heat energy must have been trapped in the Earth's system to maintain the oceans at their currently observed temperature. Currently, however, there is a 6.5 w/m difference between the estimates derived from direct observations and the estimates that ocean temperature measurements suggest. “Our hope is that using a single well-calibrated instrument to measure the most critical contribution of reflected light [light reflected back towards the sun] will reduce this difference,” said Szabo. Of the 340 watts per square meter of solar energy that falls on the sunlit side of Earth, 29 percent is reflected back into space, primarily by clouds, but also by other bright surfaces and the atmosphere itself. About 23 percent of incoming energy is absorbed by atmospheric gases, dust, and other particles in the atmosphere. The remaining 48 percent is absorbed at the surface. Courtesy . Although extremely important in understanding climate, the amount of data NISTAR transmits is small. It can easily fit within the real-time space weather reporting, so there’s no need for extra transmissions to get the NISTAR data to Earth. The radiometer’s raw measurements will be available five minutes after observation. “However, to properly calibrate this data and incorporate it into [the existing] radiation budget model will take several months at the beginning, and weeks as we become proficient at it,” said Szabo. Joining DSCOVR on its million-mile journey from home is the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC), which will capture the full face of Earth in a single image, something previously done only by the Apollo 17 astronauts and the Galileo mission on its way to Jupiter. Satellites in closer orbits get only a fraction of this view, so scientists have to piece images together to get the whole picture. This 2011 image was the first global image from the VIIRS radiometer on the NPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite. It was pieced together using data from sequential passes of the satellite. Credit: . “Low-Earth orbiting satellites see only a small patch of the ground at a time and full Earth images are stitched together from 24- or 48-hour observations. Sitting at L1, DSCOVR will see the full sunlit face of Earth at once and will provide such images roughly every two hours,” said Szabo. More than just pretty pictures, these images will provide valuable atmospheric data. Combining images from different wavelengths will let scientists measure ozone, aerosol, vegetation cover, dust and volcanic ash, cloud height, and UV radiation estimates at Earth’s surface. “We will be able to follow daily variations,” said Szabo. The interaction between clouds and aerosols is also a climate issue, since aerosols can change cloud thickness, droplet size, and lifetimes. All these factors affect incoming and outgoing sunlight, which influences the energy balance and therefore, climate. A simulated view of what pictures from DSCOVR will look like during the new moon phase each month. The image of Earth is a composite of data from different NASA satellites. The moon is in the foreground. generated by Karin Blank at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. EPIC will provide images of the entire sunlit face of our planet at 10 different wavelengths (called channels), from ultraviolet to near infrared. The narrowband filter for each channel can isolate just one particular wavelength while blocking all other sources of light. “Earth does not reflect all wavelengths of light equally. Various gases and particles in our atmosphere are excited by very specific wavelengths of light, absorbing only those photons. Our eye cannot detect these very narrow missing colors,” said Szabo. “For example: one wavelength channel on EPIC corresponds to O (ozone) absorption. Differencing the image from this wavelength with a wavelength that’s not sensitive to O gives scientists a global map of ozone. Scientists can repeat this same process for reflection of light from the Earth’s surface and atmosphere: green leaf photosynthesis to get a vegetation index, and with SO to follow volcanic eruptions.” DSCOVR started transmitting solar wind data a week after launch, but Szabo says this is for calibration purposes only. “The spacecraft will still be too close to Earth to provide space weather warnings,” he said. The same is true for NISTAR: its data won't be usable until DSCOVR has a full view of Earth, but scientists have already switched the instrument on to begin testing its electronics. The EPIC camera won’t be turned on until the satellite reaches L1 orbit at 115 days. You can expect DSCOVR's first pictures of Earth to appear on the Web sometime in late July or early August. .

        "meta_description": "While many of us were wrapped up in March Madness this spring, Alaska residents and people across the globe participated in a different kind of competition.",
        "content": "In 1917, a group of railroad engineers bet 800 dollars guessing the exact date and time that Alaska’s Tanana River ice would break. Almost 100 years later, the Nenana River Ice Classic competition continues, and participants closely observing the local climate might have an edge. The official Nenana Ice Classic tripod. taken on March 24, 2009, by Flickr user James Brooks, . Located in the interior of Alaska on the bank of the Tanana River, just upriver from its confluence with the Nenana River, the town of Nenana is home to less than 400 people, according to the 2010 Census. The Tanana River usually begins to freeze in October or November. In early March, a tripod is planted 300 feet from shore in about two feet of river ice, as seen in the photo above. It is connected to an on-shore clock that stops when the ice gives out and the tripod tumbles into the water. The history of the annual plunge of the Tanana River tripod provides a record of interior Alaska’s spring climate since the time of World War I. According to that record, kept by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, ice on the Tanana River generally can break up anywhere from April 20 to May 20. The ice went out last year at 3:48 p.m. on April 25, but the ice is currently thinner than it was at this time last year. As of April 6, the ice measured 33.5 Inches. On April 7 a year ago, the ice measured 36.8 inches. For a competition so closely tied to the climate, it makes sense to get a local expert’s analysis. Rick Thoman, Climate Sciences and Services Manager for the National Weather Service’s Alaska Region, says by far the most important factor for the timing of ice break-up are spring temperatures, especially the timing of warm or cold spells. Secondary factors include winter snowfall (which dictates water levels in the river), winter temperatures, and ice thickness. “Break-up of the Tanana River at Nenana takes place in two basically two different ways,” Thoman says. “One, referred to in Alaska as a ‘mush-out,’ occurs when the ice gradually rots in place and the water flowing in the river gradually increases as snow upstream melts and runs off. This typically happens when daily temperatures are well above freezing during the day and then it freezes hard at night. “The other way occurs when the volume of water flowing in the river rapidly increases, and the ice is lifted and mechanically broken up. This typically happens when there is a dramatic warm-up in mid- to late-April or early May, and is more likely with deeper snowpacks.” This year, Alaska’s full cold season—from October (when the ice starts forming) through March—was the third warmest on record since the winter of 1925-26. But in the Southeast Interior where Nenana and most of the Tanana River drainage is located, it was a little cooler overall, ranking as the 11th warmest cold season on record. But it was warmer than that same period last year, which came in as the 15th warmest. Although it may seem counter-intuitive, low snow winters generally produce thicker ice cover. Snow acts like an insulating blanket over ice, protecting it from changes in the air temperature aloft. If this insulating effect is reduced, the ice can grow thicker. “Typically, low-snow autumns can result in thick ice, Thoman says. “Even in a low-snow winter, there would typically be a foot or more of snow on the ice by New Year’s.” Another way of looking at the Tanana River ice break up. Data data from 1917-2014 divided into three categories: later than average (green), near-average (gray), and earlier than average (pink). Notice how earlier-than-average break up dates (pink dots) dominate recent decades. The black trend line also shows that the break-up date is getting earlier. NOAA Climate.gov graph courtesy of from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Apart from providing a fun challenge each spring, Thoman says the Nenana Ice Classic provides a useful, “non-instrumental” record of long-term changes in spring temperatures and the earlier ice-break ups in Interior Alaska over the past century. “The ice break-up record at Nenana is unique in the consistency of how the data has been gathered,” Thoman explains. “There is no reason I’m aware of to ascribe the earlier break-ups to purely local changes.” He cites the fact that Nenana has always had a population of 200-700 people, and remains mostly untouched by the urban impacts of Fairbanks about 60 miles upriver. The Tenana also runs in a single channel at this location, unlike other reaches of the river with multiple channels, where the amount of water running in any particular channel fluctuates greatly. He also points to ice break-up dates that have been collected for the Yukon River at Dawson City, Canada, since the late 1890s. While their measurements have not been gathered using the consistent method used in Nenana, the data shows exactly the same pattern: little trend until the 1970s, and then a steady decrease. These trends in river ice break-up are one more indicator of the impacts of climate change in Alaska. National Snow and Ice Data Center. 1998. . Boulder, CO: National Snow and Ice Data Center.

        "content": "If you’re like me, when you hear the word “flask,” you’re likely to picture a grizzled, trail-weary cowboy gulping down a mouthful of whiskey from a tarnished, dented tin. But say “flask” to atmospheric chemist Steve Montzka, and he sees something more like a fire extinguisher or a stainless steel, two-liter soda bottle. Analytical chemist Stephen Montzka in the lab in Boulder, Colorado, where flasks of air (such as those behind him on the desk) are tested for chemicals that replaced ozone-harming CFCs. Photo courtesy Steve Montzka. Filled with air samples from all over the world, the flasks arrive week in and week out at Montzka’s lab in Boulder, Colorado, where he leads NOAA’s effort to monitor the atmospheric concentration of the chemicals that, thanks to the Montreal Protocol, are replacing the CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) that harm Earth’s ozone layer. His flasks may be full of air, but like a cowboy with a flask of whiskey, Montzka has stories: about the success of the Montreal Protocol, what he’s learned about how the atmosphere rids itself of pollutants, and most recently, how big an influence the CFC replacements—which are also greenhouse gases— . When Montzka arrived at the Global Monitoring Division of NOAA’s Earth Sciences Research Lab in Boulder in 1991, the group had already been measuring ozone-depleting chemicals since the late 1970s. Flasks came in from all over the world—from fixed observatories, from ship cruises, from airplanes. Flasks are shipped to and from the Boulder lab in foam-lined suitcases. Samples come in from all over the world. The stack at left includes flasks from Ireland, Alaska, Hawaii, American Samoa, California, and Canada. At right, glass flasks from Palmer Station, Antarctica. Photo by David Oonk. The standard approach for measuring ozone-depleting chemicals is something called an electron capture detector. “This electron capture detector is Montzka says, with the kind of admiration that others tend to reserve for their latest smartphone. “It is one of the most sensitive detectors that exists in analytical chemistry.” The process starts with an obstacle course. Air samples are pushed through a narrow metal column by highly pressurized nitrogen gas. The column is packed with sticky resin beads that gas molecules have to squeeze past. The pace at which they emerge from the column depends on how tightly the different molecules stick to the resin. The obstacle course—its real name is —uses nitrogen to flush the samples through because nitrogen ionizes (gives up electrons) easily. As the gases emerge, they are exposed to a small amount of radioactive nickel, which emits just enough energy to ionize the nitrogen gas that’s present. Among the tangle of wires running out of the container for an Electron Capture Detector is an overheating protection device: the detectors are maintained at extremely high temperatures, and a melt down would ruin the detector. Photo by David Oonk. The electrons bumped off the nitrogen produce an electric current in the detection chamber, a sort of background hum. The “hum” can be silenced by CFCs and similar ozone-destroying substances, which contain halogens—a group of hyper-reactive elements that includes fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. That reactivity is what makes CFCs so harmful to the ozone layer. In the ionization chamber, they quickly capture the electrons from the ionized nitrogen. The background current drops, and the amount it drops is proportional to the amount of the ozone-depleting gas in the air sample. Developed by James Lovelock—of fame—the device is incredibly sensitive to ozone-depleting chemicals. “But,” says Montzka, “it turns out the electron capture detector is only good for fully halogenated carbon gases. The substitutes for the ozone-depleting gases were fully halogenated, of course,” because the point was to the things that damaged the ozone layer. In addition, Montzka points out, at that time, “The replacement chemicals had only been in use for a few years, and their concentration in some cases was as low as 1 part per trillion, compared to a couple parts per trillion for the ozone-depleting chemicals.” To measure the CFC replacements, Montzka says, “NOAA needed something different,” which is how he ended up at the lab. The Montreal Protocol eliminated ozone-depleting pollutants in phases. First-generation substitutes were still harmful, but much less so. By 2013, all countries were expected to have begun their transition to ozone-safe safe, second-generation substitutes. Montzka’s job when he started at NOAA was to re-configure the lab’s existing devices to measure the substitutes. Liquid nitrogen helps chill and condense individual gases from the flask sample. Lenses steer ion fragments toward the quadrupole: an electrified conduit with an oscillating voltage. The quadrupole is continuously tuned to allow ions of only one mass-to-charge ratio through to the detector at a time. A vacuum pump keeps oxygen from incinerating the rhenium filament. Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. The first thing he did was build a condenser upstream of the gas chromatography column. The condenser is a temperature-controlled warren of tubes, valves, and chambers that can be chilled to condense and isolate a desired gas or emptied with a vacuum pump to remove unwanted ones (like oxygen or nitrogen). To make the system even better at purifying gases, he made the gas chromatograph’s obstacle course even tougher. He swapped out the relatively short column in the existing device with a 200-foot-long, coiled glass fiber. Its internal diameter is barely bigger than a human hair, and it is coated with a thin sheen of oil. Gas molecules dissolve into and out of the oil at different rates, which determines how quickly they emerge out the end of the tube. The gas chromatography oven. Gases flow through a 200-foot glass coil with an internal diameter just bigger than a human hair. Photo by David Oonk. In the ionization chamber, he replaced the radioactive nickel with an even more powerful ionizer: a red-hot filament made out of rhenium, one of the rarest metals on Earth. The filament emits a beam of high-energy electrons that is powerful enough to directly ionize the CFC-replacement gases themselves. When a gas emerges from the coil, the electron beam shatters it into a cloud of ion fragments. Each fragment has a unique ratio of mass to electric charge, a signature as individual as a fingerprint. Each of ion fragments is unique, as well. “Every different chemical produces a unique spectrum of fragment ions, and that spectrum can be used to identify the chemical,” Montzka explains. An ion’s-eye view of the quadrupole—an electrified conduit that funnels ions to a detector. A chromatogram (top) is a picture of the electric current generated by different types of ion fragments striking the detector at different times. A mass spectrum (bottom) shows signal intensity for all the ions being generated at a particular point in the chromatogram. Photo by David Oonk. Identifying a chemical this way is called mass spectrometry, or “mass spec,” for short. A mass spec’s computer includes a library of the spectra of thousands of chemicals, from performance-enhancing drugs to black widow venom to HFC-134a—the ozone-safe refrigerant used in vehicle air conditioners today. Chemicals in a sample can be identified by matching the spectrum they produce to the spectra in the library. Montzka adds, “And if you focus on the amount of any one ion associated with a specific chemical, you can use the signal to say how much of the original chemical was in the sample.” (1) Flask hookup area.

Once Montzka retrofitted and thoroughly tested the new device, NOAA’s lab was able to process flasks not only for ozone-depleting gases but also their substitutes. The new results gave scientists and decision makers evidence of how international efforts to protect the ozone layer were progressing. In the decades since he started NOAA’s CFC-alternative monitoring project, Montzka’s had the satisfaction of seeing the levels of ozone-damaging chemicals drop and the size of the annual Antarctic ozone hole stabilize. If current trends continue, the ozone layer should recover to its 1980 condition in about 55 years. That good news doesn’t mean that our challenges with ozone-depleting chemicals and their replacements are over, however. Today’s dilemma is whether the Montreal Protocol should be amended to restrict some of the current second-generation replacements because of their potential contribution to global warming. The original CFCs were powerful greenhouse gases, and reducing them made a small but meaningful contribution to slowing global warming. Some of the second-generation CFC alternatives are potent greenhouse gases that persist for 20-30 years. In the late 2000s, some scientists predicted that unrestricted use of these long-lived substitutes through 2050 would wipe out all the climate benefits that the Montreal Protocol had achieved. Global emissions (solid lines) and atmospheric concentrations (dashed lines) of CFC-12 (blue)—a refrigerant used in vehicle air conditioning systems—and its ozone-safe replacement, HFC-134a (orange). Emissions of CFC-12 dropped sharply after the Montreal Protocol agreement in 1987, but concentrations remain high because, like most CFCs, it doesn’t break down in the atmosphere for decades. NOAA Climate.gov graph adapted from original provided by Steve Montzka. “The Montreal Protocol community saw that as a call to say, ‘Maybe we need to consider these substitutes more carefully in terms of climate,” says Montzka. It’s a debate that has been going on at virtually every Montreal Protocol meeting for at least 6 years, according to Montzka, including a recent one in Paris in November 2014, which he attended. He was at the meeting to present the community with on how closely concentrations of the high-global-warming-potential replacements matched the predictions made back in 2007. As it turns out, Montzka says, “Those earlier predictions were pretty darn accurate.” So while 2050 is still a long way off, the measurements to date suggest that the climate concerns about the rising concentrations of CFC-replacement gases can’t be dismissed. I ask Montzka if he ever gets bored. He’s been doing this work for nearly a quarter of a century, after all. He and his colleagues have unpacked, tested, and re-packed thousands of flasks, calibrated hundreds of standards, fielded innumerable calls from scientists out in the field trying to fill a flask with a pump that won’t run right or any number of other problems. If there are aspects of the work that are painstaking and repetitive, he says, they are balanced by knowing he’s providing decision makers with critical scientific information.

We are providing feedback to the public and to policy makers about the effectiveness—or not—of those global measures [to reduce pollution]. We are providing the ground truth, to let them know whether their actions are making a difference,” he says. The carefulness and longevity of the flask program has also made new scientific discoveries possible. One of the important things we learned, according to Montzka, was how robust atmospheric cleansing processes are. Many atmospheric chemicals—including methane and CFCs replacements—are removed by a single oxidant—a chemical scrubber called the hydroxyl radical. At the time of the Montreal Protocol, Montzka says, “We really didn’t know a lot about it. But by monitoring how fast a particular ozone-depleting substance disappeared [after it was banned], we could figure out what the global concentration of the cleansing hydroxyl radical must be and how variable it is from year to year. “ That knowledge about the cleansing mechanism makes the scientists more confident in their projections about when the ozone layer will ultimately recover. It also provides insight into the global warming potential of the various CFC-replacement gases. The warming potential is tied to how long they last in the atmosphere, which in turn depends on the how much of the cleansing hydroxyl radical exists—something we wouldn’t have understood as deeply without the flask program.

Because in addition to providing information to the public on things people care about, this program positions us to make scientific breakthroughs on key atmospheric issues facing us today.” Butler, J.

        "content": "Last week, NOAA engineers and satellite mission scientists had something extra to be thankful for: the successful launch of GOES-R on November 19. Providing more timely and accurate information over the Western hemisphere, total lightning mapping, and higher resolution images streaming down from space more often, the new mission marks the first major redesign of the nation’s operational Earth-observing technology in more than 20 years. A United Launch Alliance Atlas V 541 lifts off with NASA's GOES-R satellite. GOES-R is the first of four satellites to be launched for NOAA in a new and advanced series of spacecraft. Once in geostationary orbit, it will be known as GOES-16. Taken on November 19, 2016. Credit: . NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) have served as the foundation of the nation’s near real-time weather and environmental monitoring system since the launch of GOES-1 in 1975. GOES-1 only viewed the Earth every 30 minutes. Our current GOES East and GOES West satellites were launched in 2006 and 2010 respectively, and while they’ve come a long way from the technology of the 70s, all you have to do is think of how much your cell phone has changed since 2006 and you can understand why our weather satellites were due for an upgrade. (Hint: The first generation iPhone came out in 2007). On the left is the first image obtained from the GOES-1 satellite. October 25, 1975. On the right is an image from Japan’s Himawari-8 satellite, whose advanced imager is similar to GOES-R's. Images from NOAA Photo Library via , and NOAA/JMA via . “We’ve been flying operational geostationary satellites for 41 years now, and for the last 22 years we’ve been flying the same basic instrument design,” said Steve Goodman, senior scientist for the GOES-R program. “This is the first major upgrade in 22 years.” GOES-R launched with six key instruments, with two pointing towards the Earth, two focused on the surrounding space environment, and two more keeping an eye on the sun. For monitoring Earth’s weather climate research, it’s the two pointing towards Earth that are the most exciting. An artist's rendering of GOES-R in space. Credit: . The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) will be the go-to instrument for imaging Earth’s weather, land, oceans, and climate. It’s called an imager, rather than just a “camera,” because it captures way more than the visible wavelengths of light that are captured by a camera for a regular photograph. The new imager will view the Earth through 16 different wavelengths (or spectral bands) ranging from visible to infrared. A put it like this: “It’s as if the imager has 16 different types of sunglasses, each one allowing only a certain wavelength...of light to come through.” Those 16 different spectral bands include two visible channels, four near-infrared channels, and 10 infrared channels. That’s a big step up from the current GOES imager, which can only see in 5 bands total.

Credit: CIMMS AWG Proxy Team/SSEC/UW-Madison. It’s not just NOAA that’s improving imager capabilities. According to Goodman, the European, Japanese, South Korean, and Chinese meteorological agencies are introducing higher spatial resolution on their latest satellites. “All of the global geostationary satellites are going to go from 5 to 16 channels,” said Goodman. “That will give us better resolution and more accurate data all around the world.” In addition to giving scientists more wavelengths to choose from, GOES-R will be able to scan the Earth five times faster than the current system. To put that in perspective, this satellite can scan the entire Western Hemisphere as often as every 5 minutes. “When severe weather, hurricanes, and other rapidly evolving environmental phenomena form, scientists and satellite operators can switch the satellite into a regional rapid-scan operating mode and capture images updated as quickly as every 30 seconds, compared to every 7 minutes or more with the current GOES technology in rapid-scan imaging mode,” ABI Imagery Team Lead Tim Schmit said in an email. “With GOES-R, meteorologists and forecasters will have weather data as it happens to work with.” Artist's Rendition of GOES-R's Advanced Baseline Imager. Credit: ITT Exelis One big problem with the current GOES imager is that if scientists wanted to highlight an individual, high-impact weather event, they have to stop scanning the rest of hemisphere. “With the new ABI adaptive imaging capability, we don’t have to cut off South America anymore,” said Goodman. “We can keep scanning the whole Western Hemisphere.” Satellites in get snapshots of the globe two or four times a day. The current GOES imager gets a full-disk (entire hemisphere at once) image up to 8 times daily. GOES-R has four different operating modes, but it the default mode will take at least 4 full-disk images an hour: 96 in a day. “And we can monitor the faster changing weather or the evolution of clouds at four times the resolution [geographic detail] that we had before,” said Goodman. About one third of the are cloud-related. This is because clouds play such a vital role in the Earth’s weather and climate system by regulating the amount of energy that reaches and leaves the planet. The more heat energy trapped beneath cloud cover, the warmer the climate grows. The more solar energy reflected back into space, the cooler the climate. Whether the cooling or warming effect dominates now—and whether that will change in the future—is a major source of uncertainty about future climate. With the new imager’s higher resolution and near continuous observations, “we expect to unravel a lot more detail about clouds, the climate, and the role of clouds in the climate system,” said Goodman. In fact, 12 of the imager’s 16 bands can be used to monitor cloud properties. During the onset and development of extreme weather events, scientists have found that rapid growth and cooling at the tops of clouds are indicators of the potential for severe weather. Using the infrared bands, the imager can show more detailed changes in cloud-top features, helping scientists assess the potential size and severity even before a storm reaches its peak and bolstering existing weather radar systems.

The higher-resolution data is going to help on the ground, as well, with wildfire detection. “With four times better resolution, what used to look like one large fire will now better pinpoint individual fires.” The ABI 3.9 micron [heat-detecting] channel is more sensitive, and the saturation temperature increases from 350K to 400K, allowing scientists to more accurately calculate fire radiative power as well as the location of fires and hot spots. Other beneficiaries of GOES-R’s improvements are climate and weather modelers. The first global climate models were very different than what we have now and were designed to simulate only the circulation of the atmosphere. Over time, as better data and more computing resources became available, ocean, cloud, land surface, ice, snow, and other features were added. Modelling grids are often less accurate in simulations because there isn’t any data on what is happening at a particular location or altitude at any given time. With the ABI’s new (and improved) data, climatologists will be able to incorporate three times more spectral information at four times greater resolution into future models. “Not only are we getting useful operational products [from GOES], but we’re helping the models improve,” said Goodman. The GOES-R Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), Credit: . GOES-R’s other Earth-facing instrument, and the GOES-R instrument that Goodman himself is most excited, is the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM). The GLM works by taking 500 images per second and comparing each individual pixel to capture the origin and extent of a lightning flash. Mapping the initiation and proliferation of each flash, the mapper will detect in-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, and cloud-to-ground lightning activity throughout the day and night. Often, the frequency of lightning within a storm will rapidly increase ahead of other severe weather indicators like precipitation, high winds, and hail, which can be picked up by ground-based weather radars. The ability to spot lightning early could add minutes of valuable warning time in advance of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms. “I’m looking forward to the lightning mapper because I began work on it in 1979,” said Goodman, who added that he’s interested to see what another 20 years of lightning observations from space will add to the 17 years of existing lightning data collected in low earth-orbit from NASA research satellites. The aviation industry is also looking forward to the Lightning Mapper. Current ground-based radar systems don’t cover trans-oceanic routes, and the detection systems on planes frequently can’t look past the horizon. At a storm-scale resolution of about 10 kilometers (about 6 miles), GOES-R’s mapper will measure total lightning activity over the Americas and the adjacent ocean regions. Combined with the advancements of the ABI, the mapper will benefit pilots and dispatchers with more accurate and timely weather hazard information. Goodman added that the new data from the mapper might provide some new information about lightning formation during climate events like the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During the strong 1997-1998 El Nino event, scientists measured twice as many days with lightning off the U.S. Gulf Coast, compared to a normal year. “As we have another 20 years of observations from the lightning mapper, we’ll be able to see if we have changes in the structure, frequency, distribution, or trends of storms and extreme weather, and perhaps serve as an additional indicator of inter-annual to decadal changes in thunderstorms or their intensity,” said Goodman. “That should add something to our knowledge of the climate system.” GOES-R reached orbit—22,300 miles above Earth—on November 29 and officially changed its call sign to GOES-16. On December 8, it will begin 30 days of “outgassing” to make sure that there are no contaminants on the detectors or the instruments. NOAA scientists won’t actually open up the telescope doors and start testing the instruments until around Day 48. The public can expect to see their first GOES-R images in early 2017 with regular images available in the spring, said Goodman. It’s not clear yet whether GOES-R will replace GOES East (75 W) or GOES West (137 W), but Goodman said that decisions should be made by summer. GOES-S, the next satellite of this generation, is planned to launch in 2018. If all goes as planned, the four GOES-R series satellites, –R, –S, –T and –U, will continue NOAA’s geostationary coverage through 2036.

        "content": "For Bill Mook, coastal is one thing his oyster hatchery cannot afford to ignore. Mook Sea Farm depends on seawater from the Gulf of Maine pumped into a Quonset hut-style building where tiny oysters are grown in tanks. Mook sells these tiny oysters to other oyster farmers or transfers them to his oyster farm on the Damariscotta River where they grow large enough to sell to restaurants and markets on the East Coast. Bill Mook scoops up a handful of tiny oysters from a bucket in his hatchery. Photos are screenshots taken from a University of New Hampshire about the \"black box\" project. The global ocean has soaked up of human-caused carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions since the start of the Industrial Era, increasing the CO and acidity of seawater. Increased seawater acidity reduces available carbonate, the building blocks used by shellfish to grow their shells. Rain washing fertilizer and other nutrients into nearshore waters can also increase ocean acidity. Back in 2013, Mook teamed up with fisherman-turned-oceanographer Joe Salisbury of the University of New Hampshire to understand how changing seawater chemistry may hamper the growth and survival of oysters in his hatchery and oyster farm. Salisbury and his team adapted and installed in the hatchery sophisticated technology that Mook calls “the black box.” Bill Mook, owner of Mook Sea Farm on the coast of Maine, checks sensors inside the \"black box,\" which monitors the changing acidity in seawater that he pumps into his oyster hatchery.

Sensors housed inside a heavy black plastic case the size of a breadbox estimate the amount of carbonate in seawater pumped into the hatchery by measuring carbon dioxide and the alkalinity, or the capacity of the water to buffer against increases in acidity. The \"black box\" was developed with funding from the and . Mook compares ocean acidification to a train barreling down the tracks headed for his business. By measuring the year-to-year changes in carbonate and matching that against how well his oysters do in a particular year, he says he’ll understand how oysters grow under different conditions. These tools help him learn how fast and at what time the train may arrive. Shellfish farmers check cages in the Gulf of Maine's Damariscotta River, where Mook Sea Farm grows oysters for market and restaurants.

He and his team are now using “black boxes” in the waters off Puerto Rico to map where changes in acidity may contribute to coral reef erosion. Starting this year, NOAA Ship will be outfitted with black boxes to collect carbonate chemistry data during fisheries surveys along the eastern seaboard. NOAA will use this data to help improve predictions of how ocean acidification may affect valuable resources and the people, like Mook, whose livelihoods depend on them. Help us improve our content"

        "meta_description": "NOAA-funded researchers have developed a way to estimate hurricane strength using nothing but seismic data used to track earthquakes and volcanoes. The technique may help expand the pre-satellite record of tropical cyclone activity.",
        "content": "After last year’s devastating U.S. hurricane season, it’s only natural to wonder—as many did in —if 2017’s ferocity had something to do with global warming or if it was just a destructive reminder of natural climate variability. Despite how much NOAA and other scientists would like to answer this question, hurricane activity varies so much from year to year and decade to decade that it’s difficult for us to detect any long-term trends with the records we have; consistent, global satellite data only go back to around the 1960s. Prior to the satellite era, our records of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones is incomplete. Imagine if this trio of hurricanes that lined up in the Atlantic on September 16, 2010, had occurred a hundred years ago. How much would we know today about Karl's landfall in Mexico (left), Igor's path across the Caribbean (center), or even the existence of Julia (far right). NOAA satellite image. But if records from the sky can’t do the trick, it might be time to look to records from the ground. That’s the thinking behind a recent study from a team of seismically minded scientists led by Lucia Gualtieri of Princeton University and Suzana Carmago of Columbia University. Partially supported by funding from NOAA’s Climate Program Office, the team investigated 13 years of data on tropical cyclones and seismic noise around the northwest Pacific Ocean. In their resulting , published online in in December 2017, they describe a method for estimating tropical cyclone strength from seismic records alone. The technique could provide us with decades more information on cyclone activity and may reveal previously hidden trends that would help us better understand and predict how hurricane seasons may change in the future. When a hurricane hits, the swirling winds, pounding waves, and rising storm surge probably wash any thought of seismic records from most people’s minds. But Gualtieri and her colleagues knew that tropical cyclones leave imprints on the seismic record. Old-school seismometers used a large pendulum suspended from a grounded frame. The pendulum remained stationary while the frame moved with the shaking of the Earth. Attached to the pendulum, a pen traced the movements onto a drum of paper connected to the moving frame. The large spikes within the squiggly lines on a seismogram indicate seismic events like earthquakes and volcanoes. Barely wavy lines record the ambient seismic noise, mostly produced by ocean waves. Photograph from Weston Observatory, used under a Modern instruments no longer use pendulums, but they abide by the same principle. When a seismic event occurs, differences in the relative motion between a weight and a grounded frame generate an electric signal that a computer then translates into a seismogram. Both old-school and modern seismometers record dramatic seismic events as sharp spikes. But when a seismometer scribbles out the Earth’s trembling, a lot more shows up than just earthquakes and volcanoes. A constant background hum vibrates through the Earth. That normal, everyday activity is called “ambient seismic noise.” Many sources contribute to that ambient seismic noise, but the main one is ocean waves interacting with each other and sending pressurized forces towards the seafloor. During a tropical cyclone, large and powerful waves swirl and collide with each other as the winds spiral in different directions. Those supercharged wave collisions create seismic signals that rise just enough above the ambient noise for Gualtieri and her team to pick them out and use them to analyze cyclone strength. While geologists have known since the early twentieth century that cyclones leave behind these seismic traces, previous studies were mostly case studies that described the seismic details of one storm at a time. Gualtieri’s team—which included seismologists, atmospheric scientists, and a statistician—had a more ambitious goal. They wanted to find a way to categorize tropical cyclones of Category 1 strength or higher. Researchers were able to estimate the intensity and life cycle of Typhoon Jelawat and other tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific between 2011 and 2012 based solely on the imprint the storms left in the seismic record. NASA satellite image of Typhoon Jelawat approaching Taiwan on September 28, 2012. from NASA Earth Observatory. Gualtieri’s team used data from 2000-2010 to compile a dataset of all Category 1 or higher Pacific typhoons (the name for tropical cyclones in the Western North Pacific) that lasted at least two days. Using satellite data, they zoomed in on the segments of the seismic record that coincided with those storms and developed a model linking the strength of the seismic signal to the strength of the cyclone. They then tested this model on the cyclone data for 2011-2012 and found that it successfully teased out the storms’ intensities. “We got very good estimates,” said Gualtieri, “but not quite as good as satellite data.” Observed (black) and estimated (red) intensities for three tropical cyclones in the northwest Pacific Ocean during September-October 2012. The slight mismatch in timing between the observed and estimated intensities likely results from the slow build-up of winds and waves strong enough to generate a seismic signals. Climate.gov graph adapted from (2017). More of a surprise for her, and as she said, “I tried to resist this,” was that despite how complex the mechanism is that creates these tropical cyclone signals in the ambient noise, the actual relationship between storm intensity and the strength of the seismic signal can be described as linear. As Gualtieri explained it, “a linear relationship is one to one, or two to two, or three to three.” So in regards to her research, “it means that your tropical cyclone has the same power as the detected seismic signal. This linear relationship has significance because it allows us to more easily see changes [over time]. When you have a one to one relationship, the computations of strength are easier and so are the comparisons between cyclones.” Because of the relatively short record of worldwide cyclone activity, there’s no consensus on whether or not the frequency or intensity of tropical cyclones has increased due to human-caused global warming. But seismic data has been collected since the beginning of the twentieth century. If scientists can unearth some of these historic seismic records and identify past cyclones, Gaultieri’s results show that they should be able to calculate how strong the tropical cyclones were as they blustered their way across the oceans. The approach could add decades’ worth of storm intensity data to the historical record. Currently, Gualtieri is working to refine her team’s technique and to apply it to other ocean basins around the world. A key step will be to come up with a systematic way to find past cyclones in the seismic record. In general, they know that the amplitude of a cyclone’s signature makes it stand out from ambient seismic noise, but they will need to pinpoint unique characteristics if they want to leverage historic seismic records to detect unknown cyclones. In the meantime, researchers may be able to leverage other forms of historic records, such as old newspapers, to locate past cyclones in the seismic record. If it works, seismic noise data could not only improve historic understanding of tropical cyclones, but also better inform us of what to expect from tropical cyclones in the future.

        "content": "As soon as the 2021 New Year’s celebrations were over, the calls and questions started coming in from weather watchers: When will NOAA release the new U.S. Climate Normals? The Normals are 30-year averages of key climate observations made at weather stations and corrected for bad or missing values and station changes over time. From the daily weather report to seasonal forecasts, the Normals are the basis for judging how temperature, rainfall, and other climate conditions compare to what’s normal for a given location in today’s climate. For the past decade, the Normals have been based on weather observations from 1981 to 2010. In early May, climate experts at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information will be releasing an updated collection—hourly, daily, monthly, and annual Normals for thousands of U.S. locations, states, regions—based on the weather experienced from 1991 to 2020. Alongside the questions about when the new Normals will be released (first week of May), we’ve gotten a lot of questions about the Normals and . Is global warming affecting the Normals? (Yes). Are the Normals adjusted to “subtract out” global warming? (No.) So the new normal reflects our changing climate? (Yes). Then how do we keep track of what used to be normal? (Different analyses.) The last took place in 2011, when the baseline shifted from 1971-2000 to 1981-2010. Among the highlights of the rollout was the creation of a map showing how climate-related planting zones across the contiguous United States had shifted northward in latitude and upward in elevation. It was a clear signal that normal overnight low temperatures across the country were warmer than they used to be. Changes in U.S. climate-related planting zones between the 1971-2000 Normals and the 1981-2010 Normals. Many places' coldest temperatures of the year grew warmer between the two periods, leading to a shift in plant hardiness zones. NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NCEI. Explore an The planting zone maps emphasized a key point about the Normals and climate change: the once-per-decade update means these products gradually come to reflect the “new normal” of climate change caused by global warming. What’s normal today is often very different than what was normal 50 or 100 years ago. This gradual adjustment is the point: the purpose of the Normals is to provide context on what climate is like today, not how it’s changing over time. The U.S. Climate Normals collection has 10 versions: 1901-1930, 1911-1940, and so on through 1991-2020. In the image below, we’ve compared the U.S. annual average temperature during each Normals period to the 20 -century average (1901-2000). Places where the annual temperature during a given Normals era was colder than the 20 -century average are blue; places where the temperature was warmer than average are red. Annual U.S. temperature compared to the 20th-century average for each U.S. Climate Normals period from 1901-1930 (upper left) to 1991-2020 (lower right). Places where the normal annual temperature was 1.25 degrees or more colder than the 20th-century average are darkest blue; places where normal annual temperature was 1.25 degrees or more warmer than the 20th-century average are darkest red. Maps by NOAA Climate.gov, based on analysis by Jared Rennie, North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies/NCEI. Individual maps ( ). The influence of long-term global warming is obvious: the earliest map in the series has the most widespread and darkest blues, and the most recent map has the most widespread and darkest reds. Today, the normal annual temperatures across the country are warmer than the 20th-century average virtually everywhere. From 1901-1930, the annual average temperature was mostly colder than the 20th-century average. What’s also obvious in these comparisons is that the influence of global warming on normal U.S. temperature isn’t the same everywhere or during every 30-year period on record. Otherwise, the maps would have transitioned gradually from dark blue everywhere to dark red everywhere. In fact, a few locations do exhibit that pattern of gradual, steady warming from one Normals era to the next. Southeastern Oregon. Southern Florida. You can probably spot others. But in many places, the pace of warming changes from decade to decade due to other climate influences, both natural and human (think the Dust Bowl and smokestack pollution before the Clean Air Act). For example, in much of the U.S. Gulf Coast region, the maps show that normal annual temperatures were actually warmer than the 20 -century average in the first four sets of Normals. Beginning with the 1941-70 Normals, they reverted, with normal annual temperature growing increasingly cooler over the next two periods. That cooling pattern began to weaken with the 1971-2000 Normals, and it has all but disappeared today. “It varies” is the main message of the maps showing how the normal annual precipitation across the country has changed. Precipitation—regardless of human-caused climate change—varies a lot from place to place across the United States. Few places exhibit a precipitation trend that is either steadily wetter or steadily drier than the 20 -century average. Instead, drier areas and wetter areas shift back and forth without an obvious pattern. Normal annual U.S. precipitation as a percent of the 20th-century average for each U.S. Climate Normals period from 1901-1930 (upper left) to 1991-2020 (lower right). Places where the normal annual precipitation was 12.5 percent or more below the 20th-century average are darkest brown; places where normal annual precipitation was 12.5 percent or more wetter than the 20th-century average are darkest green. Maps by NOAA Climate.gov, based on analysis by Jared Rennie, North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies/NCEI. Individual maps ( ). For example, the Southwest was much wetter than the 20 -century average in the 1901-30 and 1911-40 Normals, and then mostly drier than the 20 -century average in the next four Normals. The 1961-90 Normals were a mix, with few areas either very wet or dry relative to the 20 -century average. The next two Normals periods—1971-2000 and 1981-2010— were once again much wetter than the 20 -century average across much of the Southwest, but the pattern has reversed in the new Normals. That inconsistency isn’t surprising, despite the fact that human-caused climate change likely is influencing U.S. precipitation in some places and seasons. It’s just that what controls precipitation varies so much from place to place and month to month that the influence of global warming also varies a lot. Some parts of the country are to see increases in annual average precipitation, and others may see decreases. Some may see wetter winters but drier summers, with little net change in annual average precipitation—but big impacts on natural ecosystems and agriculture that depend on a certain seasonal cycle. Some will see a shift in the type or intensity of precipitation without seeing a change in their annual total. More rain, less snow. More downpours, with longer dry spells between. With all this nuance, it’s not surprising that precipitation maps don’t show the same unmistakable fingerprint of climate change that the temperature maps do. And yet, it’s probably not a coincidence that the last four maps in the series—the 1961-1990, 1971-2000, 1981-2010, and 1991-2020 Normals—are nationally the four wettest-looking maps in the collection. At least some of that wetness relative to the 20 -century average is linked to the overall warming and “wetting” of the atmosphere that’s occurred as rising temperatures enhance evaporation of water from the ocean and land surface. The 1991-2020 Normals tell us what is normal in today’s climate. NOAA does other analyses that tell us about what used to be normal. For its monthly and annual , temperature averages and precipitation totals since 1895, with many states ranking towards warm extremes recently. Also, U.S. and global climate conditions are compared to the 20 -century average. Average annual temperatures for the contiguous United States from 1895 to 2020 (orange line), along with the warming trend of 0.16˚Fahrenheit per decade (red line). Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NCEI . Having the entire 20 century included for comparison means the baseline captures more of the range of natural variability that’s possible in U.S. and global climate. It also provides a reasonable—but conservative—indication of the influence of long-term warming on temperatures. For the end-of-year , NOAA also includes an additional comparison of the current year’s temperature to average temperatures from the 21-year period from 1880-1901, when the influence of global warming was still small relative to natural variability. At the NCEI website, NOAA provides a couple other ways of understanding how U.S. climate has changed over time. They have a showing both recent and long-term trends in temperature and precipitation. The maps are available for each month and the four seasons. You can also showing monthly, seasonal, or yearly climate conditions for any region, state, and many cities that shows the long-term trend.

        "content": "A new Community Risk and Resiliency Act recently by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo requires state agencies to consider future risks posed by climate change. While sea level rise and storm surge are big concerns along the New York’s coast, communities across the entire state will need to consider the impact of heavier and more frequent extreme rainfall events in a warmer future. Heavy downpours have increased across much of the country; the largest increase has been in the Northeast. In the top map, the different shades of blue show percent increases in the amount of precipitation that falls in very heavy events (the heaviest 1 percent of all daily events) from 1958 to 2012 for each U.S. region (insets are not to scale). Yellowish brown indicates decreases. Between 1958 and 2010, the fraction of total rainfall in the Northeast that came down in very heavy events increased by more than 70 percent. Projections of future climate suggest that the recent trend toward increased heavy precipitation events will continue in a warmer future for much of the Unites States. The bottom map shows the factor by which the frequency of extreme daily precipitation events is projected to increase by the later part of this century (2081-2100) compared to the later part of last century (1981-2000) across the United States (insets are not to scale). In this case, “extreme daily precipitation” means a daily amount that now occurs just once in 20 years. Under a scenario assuming continued increases in carbon dioxide emissions ( ), these events would occur at least twice as often in almost every part of the continental United States—not just in the eastern half of the country, but even in regions where precipitation may decrease, such as the Southwest. The Northeast region is projected to expect extreme rain events up to four times more often under the increasing emissions scenario. The western half of Alaska could experience these events up to six times more often. These trends are widely thought to be associated with the fact that warmer air temperatures fuel more evaporation, which leads to a wetter atmosphere. Scientists have measured a significant increase in specific humidity (the volume of water vapor) over the Earth’s surface, which is consistent with the long-term warming trend in our planet's average surface temperature. Climate change also alters atmospheric processes that in turn affect weather patterns and storms. According to the , the impacts of more frequent extreme precipitation events will be particularly acute for the Northeast. Heavier rain could exacerbate floods that disrupt traffic and transportation, overburden stormwater and runoff systems, damage property and infrastructure, and reduce crop yields due to excess water or field flooding, among other impacts. There has already been an increase in flooding events in the Midwest and Northeast, where the nation's largest increases in heavy rain have occurred. According to the Community Risk and Resiliency Act, the state must consider these trends toward more heavy rain events in certain permitting, funding, and regulatory decisions for activities such as smart growth assessments, construction of wastewater treatment plants, and maintenance of transportation infrastructure for hazardous waste. In a press release announcing the legislation, Governor Cuomo said, “The new reality of extreme weather has had painful consequences for New Yorkers in virtually every region of our state, but today we’re taking another step forward in our goal of building back better, stronger, and more resilient than ever before.” Maps by NOAA Climate.gov, based on and of the .

        "meta_description": "In 1938, an unexpected Category 3 hurricane plowed across Long Island and into Connecticut. Could history repeat itself?",
        "content": "New England has weathered its share of battering storms, and even an occasional tornado. With a few notable exceptions, however, most hurricanes that swirl northward along the East Coast veer out into the Atlantic without making landfall. Not so in 1938. The \"Great New England Hurricane of 1938,\" also known as \"The Long Island Express\" or simply \"The Big One,\" blindsided New Englanders that year, striking without warning in the afternoon of September 21. The Great New England Hurricane of 1938 started as a tropical cyclone off of Cape Verde, Africa, on September 10. After threatening Florida on September 20, it moved north, and most forecasters believed it would head northeast to spin itself out in the North Atlantic Ocean. Instead, the storm accelerated northward, reaching forward speeds of up to 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, on a beeline for the southern shore of New England. Map courtesy of Hunter Allen. Late in the day on September 19, 1938, weather forecasters who had alerted Floridians of the possibility of a hurricane landfall saw that the storm had turned north. As the storm seemed to be heading out to sea, most of them breathed a sigh of relief and went home. Forecasts issued for the eastern seaboard that day contained high wind and gale advisories, but made no mention of a hurricane. Most of the ships that might have reported the storm's location had retreated to shore, waiting for the hurricane to spin itself out in the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Essentially unwatched, the hurricane abruptly tripled its northward speed, and traveled the 425 miles (700 km) from Cape Hatteras to Long Island in less than 8 hours. When the storm plowed across Long Island and slammed into Connecticut, it was a Category 3 hurricane. The storm's rapid northward motion amplified the wind speeds on the east side of the storm, and buildings disintegrated under the force of wind-driven waves and rain. In an example of spectacularly bad timing, landfall occurred at the same time as high tide, maximizing the height of the deadly surge of seawater that was pushed ashore by the storm. In the New England Hurricane of 1938, fishing boats and yachts were carried ashore by waves and wind. Here, homeowners found a large boat and industrial debris deposited in their yard. Photo by A. Morgan Stewart,The Day, courtesy of Peg Van Patten. Beaches in Connecticut and Rhode Island were stripped clean of the summer cottages that had crowded their shores, and fishing boats were tossed about like toys, some settling as far as a mile inland. One startling arrangement of debris was a boat that had crashed right into a funeral parlor. As is common with strong hurricanes, many people died by drowning as the storm surge flooded their homes, schools, and businesses. After battering the coast, the hurricane moved north, right into the heart of New England. When it was over, 57,000 homes from the Bahamas to Quebec were damaged or destroyed and around 600 people were dead (estimates vary). Total property damage from \"The Big One\" in New England was estimated at over $300 million in 1938-equivalent to almost $5 billion in 2010 dollars. Even when compared with the devastating Category 4 and 5 hurricanes that made landfall in the United States in 2004 and 2005, the Great Hurricane of 1938 still ranks as one of the most costly and deadly hurricanes in United States history. What if another major hurricane were to hit New England this year? Would residents fare any better than they did in 1938? My dad was a 29-year old freelance newspaper reporter then, writing mostly for newspaper in New London, Connecticut. He recalled that the morning of September 21 had been a perfect beach day. As the storm approached and its severity became obvious, Dad fought his way to the school to retrieve my older brother, Russ, and brought him home. Russ recalls crouching behind an armchair, covered by his mother's body. When Dad shouted, \"Here it comes!!\" Russ remembers hearing an unearthly roaring sound, like a train thundering by at top speed. Peg Van Patten, of Connecticut Sea Grant. Russ was one of the lucky ones. Many children died in the storm, drowned where they huddled in a library, or tossed about by the violent waves that crashed ashore. In Rhode Island, a school bus, including children and driver, was washed out to sea and lost. My grandparents, who had a coastal farm on Barn Island, had gathered refugees in their home. As the group fled 12-foot waves to higher ground, they spotted a naked corpse in the yard.

My dad, who had a considerable vocabulary, was so shocked at the devastation he saw that evening and the following day that he could hardly write. Instead, he relied on his camera, and took many photos to tell the story. Much of the city of New London had burned after sparks from downed power lines caused businesses and a coal company to catch fire. lost power, but sent its reporters and photographers out into what it later called \"the Stygian darkness\" and through smoke like \"the devil's furnace,\" at risk to their lives. The combined effects of the hurricane-winds, floods, and fire-caused $4 million in property damage in New London alone.

Many of my father's photographs show the Bostonian train, which miraculously escaped entrapment as it went through five feet of water on a swaying trestle bridge between Mystic and Stonington, Connecticut. In Stonington, with all the passengers huddled in one car, the train tipped off the tracks in waist-deep water, and passengers had to leap out into the wind and water and wade to safety. Hurricanes arrive in New England only about once per decade, on average, but they are still part of the region's climate. As such, people shouldn't wonder \"If\" the Northeast will experience another hurricane like that of 1938, but rather \"When?\" Twelve significant tropical cyclones made landfall in New England between 1900 and 2009. Storm intensity at landfall is given by , which uses wind speeds to classify the intensity of tropical cyclones as tropical storms or hurricanes of specific categories. The table also shows the forward motion of each storm at the time of landfall. Average forward motion of storms that have come ashore in New England is over 30 miles (50 km) per hour, well above the average speed of 10-12 miles (16-20 km) per hour observed for hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Data provided by NOAA’s National Weather Service. Twelve significant tropical cyclones made landfall in New England during the past 11 decades.

Data provided by NOAA's National Weather Service. A single hurricane is an extreme weather event. Predicting the timing of the next one to come ashore in New England is far beyond meteorologists' current abilities. However, patterns of hurricane frequency and intensity over time and space are connected to climate, and climate scientists are working hard to figure out if and how our changing global climate might affect hurricane patterns. Especially since 2005, when a series of strong hurricanes resulted in large numbers of casualties and billions of dollars in property damage in the United States, people have been concerned that global warming might increase the number or intensity of hurricanes that form. Understanding how Earth's changing climate will affect patterns of hurricanes involves a range of complex factors. For example, as the temperature of the ocean's surface increases, more heat energy is available to fuel tropical systems, so the intensity of hurricanes that form might increase. However, increases in air temperatures can enhance the difference in pressure and wind speeds at different altitudes, leading to conditions that interfere with cyclone development, so the number of storms that form might decrease. A broad community of NOAA scientists and other researchers around the world are actively working with historical records, data from lab experiments, and global climate models to understand and predict the characteristics of future hurricanes. As of early 2010, some of the most prominent tropical cyclone researchers in the United States agree that in a warmer world, hurricanes may form less frequently, yet the ones that do form may be slightly stronger than those of the past. For more information about new hurricane research, please see Satellites, Planes, and Hurricanes (available July 15, 2010) Despite our uncertainty about when, where, and how intense future hurricanes will be, we can estimate the impacts they may have on property. Based on population density, infrastructure, and personal wealth of residents along the shores of New England, a study published in in 2008 estimated that the price tag for a Category 3 hurricane in that region today could be as high as $70 billion. To put that amount into perspective, consider that if you spent a million dollars every day, it would take almost 200 years to spend that much money! If residents of the Northeast receive an order to evacuate as a hurricane approaches, Interstate 95 and Merritt Parkway might need to be used as one-way routes, moving in either direction, to maximize the flow of traffic.

If residents of the Northeast receive an order to evacuate as a hurricane approaches, Interstate 95 and Merritt Parkway might need to be used as one-way routes, moving in either direction, to maximize the flow of traffic. Image courtesy of Hunter Allen. We can also assess the capability of existing transportation infrastructure to facilitate an emergency evacuation of the region. In July 2008, speakers at the Northeast Hurricane Mitigation Leadership Forum expressed concern over the lack of sufficient roads to evacuate the dense population centers in the region. The Interstate 95 transportation corridor serves as a major traffic artery through the Northeast. If this highway remains passable, thousands of cars per hour will be able to use it for evacuation. If that route is blocked or damaged though, gridlock could occur, and the few routes left available could be overwhelmed. The potential for the Northeast to experience another \"Long Island Express\" is still very real. Results from revealed the combination of low pressure over eastern North America and high pressure over the western North Atlantic Ocean that put the 1938 hurricane on the fast track to the north. Similar pressure patterns still occur today, so New England remains vulnerable to hurricanes that can close in on the region at speeds nearing the legal limit for cars traveling on a highway. Despite the risk, the potential for even fast-moving storms to arrive in New England without warning has diminished appreciably since 1938. An array of instruments around the world and continuous global coverage by satellites ensure that experts at NOAA's National Hurricane Center are aware of weather systems that might evolve into tropical cyclones. If a nascent storm develops the characteristics of a tropical cyclone, forecasters use a range of detailed observations to monitor its status and predict its likely path. If a tropical cyclone develops to the point that experts judge that it may endanger lives and property, the National Hurricane Center can send Air Force and NOAA planes to fly over or through the storm to drop instrument packages into the swirling masses of clouds. Data from the instruments help the scientists understand the storm's internal characteristics and potential for further strengthening. NOAA's high altitude jet, the Gulfstream IV, is equipped to drop small instrument packages on parachutes into storms. As the packages descend, they serve as miniature weather stations, continually measuring temperature, pressure, and humidity and sending the data back to the plane. The instruments also gather data that indicate horizontal and vertical wind speeds within the storm. Photo courtesy of NOAA.

Global-scale numerical weather models and forecast tools, constantly updated with real-time data to characterize the current state of the atmosphere, help forecasters predict the track that hurricanes will follow. These tools have improved the accuracy of forecasts tremendously, cutting errors in storm track forecasts in half since 1995. Beginning with the 2010 hurricane season, the National Hurricane Center will announce a for specified coastal areas 48 hours in advance of the time that hurricane conditions are considered within that area. If hurricane conditions are for a specified coastal area, a of those conditions will be issued at least 36 hours before they arrive. With today's forecast capabilities and communications available through the Internet, television, cell phones, and radio, it seems inconceivable that residents of New England could be surprised again by a land-falling hurricane. But as recent attempts to evacuate huge cities have shown, receiving ample warning in advance of an approaching hurricane is only part of the solution. To increase chances for survival, residents also need to plan ahead and know how to access and use timely information about the best options and pathways for getting out of harm's way. Each year, as hurricane season approaches, New Englanders who know about the Great Hurricane of 1938 still brace for the possibility that a similar storm will arrive. As hurricane seasons end, scientists compile data on all the new storms, and consider them within the context of the historical record. They look for the continuation of current trends, or a pattern that suggests a new trend has begun. Through the study of past hurricanes and the complex climate system within which they form, scientists continue striving to increase the accuracy and lead-time of their predictions. Their ultimate goal is to provide enough warning so people have the opportunity to protect themselves and their property the next time another \"Big One\" comes around.

        "content": "Warming due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions will likely increase the potential for ‘very large fires’—the top 10 percent of fires, which account for a majority of burned areas in many regions of the United States. Climate change is expected to both intensify fire-friendly weather conditions, as well as lengthen the season during which very large fires tend to spread. The map at right shows the projected increase in the number of “very large fire weeks”—weeks in which conditions are favorable to the occurrence of very large fires—by mid-century (2041-2070) compared to the recent past (1971-2000). The darkest shades of red indicate that up to a six-fold increase is predicted across parts of the West. This area includes the Great Basin and Northern Rockies, as well as the Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains in Northern California. The potential for very large fire events is also expected to increase along the southern coastline and in the forests around the Great Lakes, although the number of events along the northern tier of the country should only increase moderately given the historically low potential for these events. For this study, researchers considered the average results of 17 climate model simulations to examine how the potential for very large fires is expected to change. Future projections* were based on a higher-emissions scenario called , which assumes continued increases in carbon dioxide emissions. Along with the elevated potential for very large fires across the western US in future decades, other climate modeling studies have projected increases in fire danger and temperature, and decreased precipitation and relative humidity during the fire season. The increased potential for these extreme events is also consistent with an observed increase in the number of very large fires in recent decades. In addition, scientists have detected trends toward overall warming, more frequent heat waves, and diminished soil moisture during the dry season. The combination of these climate conditions and historic fire suppression practices that have led to the build-up of flammable debris have likely led to more frequent large fire events. At this very moment, more than 70 wildfires are burning throughout the West, putting homes, lives, and livelihoods at risk. The smoke created by these fires exacerbates chronic heart and lung diseases while also degrading visibility and altering snowmelt, precipitation patterns, water quality, and soil properties. In addition to public health impacts, projected trends in extreme fire events have important implications for terrestrial carbon emissions and ecosystems. The authors of the study also note that these findings could place a burden on national and regional resources for fighting fires. Fire suppression costs in the U.S. have more than doubled in recent decades, exceeding $1 billion per year since the year 2000, the National Interagency Fire Center reports. The vast majority of that money is spent on large incidents. This research was funded in part by the program, part of NOAA's Climate Program Office in the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.

It was a frigid January morning in Milwaukee and I was scheduled for a busy day at our family medicine clinic. The arresting my attention was reporting on the impacts of warming temperatures on an ecosystem across the world. Scientists found that “virtually no male turtles” were hatched in a warming breeding ground for green sea turtles in the Great Barrier Reef. The sex of sea turtles is, in part, determined by the temperature of the egg during incubation. The new study showed that over 99% of the sea turtles hatched were females in the much-warmer-than-normal breeding grounds. The shift in environmental dynamics presents an existential threat if temperatures—driven by global warming—rise faster than the turtles can adapt. A green turtle hatchling headed out to sea on March 28, 2012.

Tears welled up alongside a sense of dread about how fast the world my two daughters are growing up in is changing. I remembered the fear I felt as a child when I learned how human-made chemicals were destroying Earth’s stratospheric ozone layer, which protects all life from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays. Transported back to my eight-year-old self, I recalled wearing an Earth Day t-shirt depicting the hole in the ozone layer with white and hot pink puff paint on a teal blue background. I felt powerless as a kid but believed grown-ups would find a solution, if they paid attention. I wore the t-shirt, feeling that was how I could do my part. Ultimately, layer. Human emissions of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer—the layer of the atmosphere that protects life on Earth from ultraviolet radiation—dropped sharply in the 1990s following the Montreal Protocol. NOAA Climate.gov image adapted from A drive to problem-solve in the face of distress has always been wired into my mindset. This drive is what led me to choose a career in medicine. However, as I headed in to work that day, trudging across the ice- and salt-encrusted parking lot, I felt deflated and powerless. I was the adult now, but I couldn’t see a path to healing. What could I do as a family doctor in Wisconsin to address the daunting problem of global warming? Amid the bustling pace of family medicine (delivering babies and treating diabetes and everything in between) and early motherhood (kissing scraped knees and bedtime stories and snuggles), it would take a few more years of doom scrolling news headlines and reading the latest climate research before I stumbled onto Yale University’s . Could this be the path to healing that I was seeking—becoming a “ ”? At first, it seemed ill-advised to try tackling a graduate-level online course above and beyond my already overloaded work schedule. It was the summer of 2021, and I was exhausted. With the rest of the medical community, I was just coming up for air after navigating the chaos of the first wave of the COVID pandemic, only to face wave after wave of new variants as well as other health impacts of the pandemic—including worsened mental health, substance abuse, missed cancer screenings, debilitating effects of long COVID, and more. But even amid the exhaustion, I recognized how I could apply lessons I learned from the COVID pandemic to the climate crisis, and I began to find hope. In the early days of the pandemic, we were playing defense and our health care systems were overwhelmed. We rushed to treat patients while conducting research, while learning about the rapidly evolving new disease in real time. But later, with more knowledge on transmission, adequate masks, at-home COVID tests, the advent of vaccines, and better communication strategies, we gradually shifted our efforts from treating symptoms to preventing infections. Elevating the importance of safe and healthy environments at home and work, we were able to integrate COVID prevention into the bigger picture of comprehensive wellness strategies for our patients and communities. The pandemic was also a powerful reminder to me that as a medical student and physician, I trained and practiced skills to respond in times of crisis. Navigating the COVID pandemic as a family doctor and medical director forced me to refine those skills. I developed a sense of empowerment and a capacity to lean in and fully face disaster while acting to prevent further destabilization. Doctors are already called to respond to disasters caused by extreme weather and wildfires. If I—and other doctors—had more training, we could anticipate and plan to better manage and prevent changing health impacts due to global warming, and not just react to them in a pandemic-like crisis mode. In medical school and residency, we learned that environmental health and human health go hand-in-hand, but exploring the human health impacts of a rapidly changing environment driven by global warming had never been part of the discussion. So my next step on the path to becoming a climate doctor was to enroll in a year-long at the University of Colorado. As I learned more about the intricate interactions between global warming, the environment, and human health, a veil was lifted. Now, I see clearly how climate-driven extreme events—such as heat waves, severe storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires—are increasingly harming both human and natural environments. Now I understand why these health hazards and others—such as poor air quality and the spread of insect-borne diseases—are very likely to worsen this century due to the buildup of human-emitted heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere (like carbon dioxide and methane). The threat of global warming brings a clear and present danger to human health and well-being.

I learned about new tools and actions we can take to protect our health. For example, I studied temperature maps that reveal , and I saw that the same disenfranchised communities that suffer the worst health equity gaps also face the highest heat exposure in the city, threatening physical and mental health further. I was encouraged to learn that solutions, like increased tree canopy, are associated with a multitude of health benefits. Trees help cool their immediate surroundings by providing shade and through evapotranspiration—much like how sweating helps to cool our bodies on hot days. And, research shows, trees offer other benefits such as and Kids play in a fountain in Battery Park, New York, on June 16, 2012. Many urban areas are working to increase tree cover and provide cooling features to help residents cope with extreme heat. Adapted from by S.L. Used under a Creative Commons I also learned about new opportunities for physicians to expand their knowledge base and develop systems and skills to meet the new health challenges presented by rapidly changing threats like heat and extreme weather. With these tools, here are four ways physicians can lead the way in protecting the health of our communities in the face of global warming and climate change: Clinicians need to recognize increased prevalence of climate-driven exposures in their communities, such as wildfires, that affect their patients’ health. Three major ones are air quality, allergy season, and insect-borne diseases. For example, when Canadian wildfire smoke blew into Wisconsin in the summer of 2023, it caught local physicians on their heels. In an area not typically affected by wildfires, many clinicians were not practiced in counseling on health protection due to severely degraded air quality. My colleagues rapidly learned about and then taught patients how to use the and air filters for their homes.

Smoke from fires in Canada pushed particle pollution in the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley region into the range considered \"unhealthy\" (red dots) and \"very unhealthy\" (purple dots). Image from the Environmental Protection Agency AirNow.gov website. Spring and Fall seasons are getting warmer, bringing that cause more suffering from itchy, watery eyes, runny noses, and asthma flares. Clinicians can educate their patients on why their symptoms are getting worse, and how to protect themselves. Changes in temperatures and the length of growing seasons will allow mosquitoes, ticks, and other pests to carry diseases (like West Nile Virus, Lyme disease, alpha gal syndrome, dengue, and malaria) into new geographic regions. Greater exposure to infectious diseases means physicians may need to recognize signs and symptoms of illnesses that were previously not part of their day-to-day routine. More education opportunities and peer-support initiatives are needed to help health professionals prepare for the myriad of . I am now teaching a cohort of current and future physicians about the causes and effects of global warming, and helping them to connect the dots just like I did. Global warming is not some abstract threat far away or far in the future; rather, . The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased across much of the United States, particularly the eastern part of the continental US, with implications for flood risk and infrastructure planning. Maps show observed changes in three measures of extreme precipitation: (a) total precipitation falling on the heaviest 1% of days from 1958–2021. Numbers in black circles depict percent changes at the regional level. Data were not available for the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands and the US Virgin Islands. Image adapted from We have seen bringing significant impacts on physical and mental health among affected communities. These increases are linked to population growth and development, but they are also connected to climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identifies the A greenhouse gas-warmed atmosphere is a “thirstier” atmosphere, with a greater capacity to hold more water vapor, creating conditions primed for intensified hurricanes, heavier rainfall, and more flooding. For example, preliminary analysis of Hurricanes and indicate that global warming increased their intensity and rainfall totals and made similar storms more likely than they would otherwise have been. On average, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) the atmosphere warms, it can hold 7 percent more water vapor. When atmospheric processes do trigger rain, that extra \"background\" water vapor can make it rain more heavily, leading to increased flooding. NOAA Climate.gov illustration. And we’re seeing surges in emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths with increasingly frequent and severe extreme heat events, as a result of . One of the hottest areas in the US, in Phoenix and Maricopa County, has seen Research shows that those who tend to be hurt first and worst are children, older adults, those with chronic diseases, and people of color living in under-resourced communities. While this type of climate science and health content was not always part of medical education, we see growing efforts to remedy the gap. For example, Dr. Gaurab Basu and medical student partners at Harvard Medical School have implemented a to prepare medical students and doctors to face climate-related challenges. An elderly woman faints from heat on New York City's Upper East Side in 2011. Photo from /Marcus Santos. Clinicians can educate patients on their increasing exposure to climate-driven hazards; and then help them connect the dots on why their symptoms for existing conditions, like allergies and asthma, could worsen, and what they can do to protect themselves and their families. I find hope in prevention and proactive wellness management, just as I did while in the throes of the COVID pandemic. I am inspired by the growing community of climate doctors who are mobilizing to heal our communities and our ailing planet. For example, one of my colleagues is sharing public health messaging on how “ ” (an approach to eating that centers fruits, vegetables, legumes and grains but is flexible to include smaller amounts of dairy, meats and seafood) simultaneously keep our brains and bodies healthier help slow global warming. There’s a win-win! Another colleague is working to protect and improve our youth’s mental health through . Getting youth outside and involved in restoration projects protects the environment, helps them learn more about nature and gives them a sense of purpose and empowerment that, research shows, helps mitigate feelings of anxiety and depression. That’s a win-win-win! As trusted science professionals, physicians can lend their expertise beyond the clinic and community health, and step into the realm of health systems and policy work. Physicians and other health professionals have aligned efforts in organizations like and to reduce the greenhouse gas pollution created by the health sector. For example, anesthesiologists are advocating to eliminate leaky and wasteful anesthetic gas systems and choose better agents for anesthesia that work just as well for patients but aren’t as harmful to our environment. A growing number of health organizations have signed the to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases by 50% by 2030, and net zero by 2050; and to develop plans for making clinics and hospitals and the communities they serve more climate resilient. Groups of physicians and health professionals can advocate for this type of commitment from their employers. A few short years ago, I couldn’t see how to affect change in the face of the climate crisis as a family physician. Now, I see networks of health professionals working to combat the climate crisis and protect our communities. From the exam room to the classroom, climate doctors are treating patients, educating the public, and advocating for change with system leaders. To quote essayist and climate activist Rebecca Solnit, “Hope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. It is an ax you break down doors with in an emergency.” Through climate medicine, I have leaned in, learned, found solutions, and joined a movement for collective action. I have an ax in one hand to break out of this emergency, and a handful of seeds in the other hand to plant a new future for our loved ones and families to thrive. Anne Getzin, M.D., has started thinking of herself as a \"climate doctor,\" who can help her patients and community prepare for the impacts of climate change on human health.

        "content": "Brian Swett is Boston's Chief of Environment, Energy, and Open Space. Photo courtesy the city of Boston. Sea level rise and storm surge get a lot of attention. And certainly in the post-Sandy environment we’ve been spending a lot of time both dealing with our current vulnerabilities to major storm events and future vulnerabilities associated with increasing sea level rise. But we’re also at the end of the storm-water system for much of Eastern Massachusetts, so we’re worried about —inland flooding is a big concern. Also, as with any city around the country, heat waves and the urban heat island effect are big concerns. We’ve experienced some significant heat waves over the last several years. During a heat wave last summer, they actually had to downgrade the power output coming out of the nearby nuclear power station. Because the seawater was so warm, it didn’t supply that temperature difference to adequately cool to the degree necessary to run the plant at full capacity. So we are very concerned about scenarios like that. At the exact same time everyone is turning on their air conditioning to deal with a major heat event, our power system is less reliable and is vulnerable as things start to snowball. So we spend a lot of time talking about infrastructure. Boston is one of a number of coastal cities facing [these challenges]. If you add up the 20 largest cities in the U.S. by metro GDP, 10 of them are coastal and they represent about 30 percent of the U.S. economy. This is not just a challenge for the sake of: “Do we want to protect a couple of cities around the country?” This is a national economic imperative to figure out how to provide climate change preparedness to the urban environments along the coast. If we don’t, that’s a significant chunk of our [national] economy that’s at risk. The resilience and preparedness of a neighborhood is not just about the structures and the infrastructure. It’s also about the people and making sure that we take advantage of opportunities to get ourselves ready both in the long term as well as, if it’s a storm event like a hurricane, 48 to 72 hours ahead of time. We need to understand the things we need to do to make ourselves less vulnerable. And we need to understand what to do during the storm to make sure we’re as protected and safe as possible. We need to empower folks with the right information and tools and resources to make good decisions, and to be ready for all the sorts of climatic hazard events that we anticipate. We’re making changes as we speak in terms of evaluating evacuation routes, evaluating evacuation zones, reaching out with more information on preparedness plans that families and individuals can pull together, and understanding what has worked in other cities that could work here. Making sure that we’re empowering folks so that they are as prepared as possible and things don’t catch them by surprise. Up here, we’re pretty good at preparing for snow events. If I told somebody, even in July, that we’re expecting 20 inches of snow in two days, everybody has that mental checklist up here in Boston: Make sure I know where the shovel is; I know the streets not to park on because there’ll probably be a parking ban; I got my bread and my milk; I’ve got salt for the walkway. We don’t have that mental checklist up here for hurricanes and we certainly don’t drill for it the same way we drill for something like fire emergencies. We have fire evacuation drills, but I’ve never seen a commercial building in Boston do a flooding drill to see how they can make their building water tight; or drill to put out sand bags to temporarily stop water flow. Those are the types of things we need to start to get ready for before storms hit. We need to be proactive about hazards we are less familiar with because they’re more likely to happen going forward. The by , via . We’ve always been a city that’s been living with water, so to speak. We were known as the Shawmut Peninsula and there was a very small isthmus that’s present-day Washington Street that connected the three mountains of Beacon Hill to rest of the city. In a lot of respects, our city has always had a very close relationship with the water. Much of it is built on filled tide lands and so much of our history is tied to water-based activities and industry. We are embracing this challenge going forward. We’re definitely not calling retreat. It is a challenge on a scale — in terms of both the speed and the magnitude of the changes we’re facing — that no human habitation has faced before. But, here in Boston, we benefit from phenomenal intellectual capacity and an interest in thinking long term, and a connection to the water that’s going to have us develop solutions across the board at the building scale, the neighborhood scale, and the infrastructure scale. The most common advice I give is to bring the science to the sidewalk. That is both in terms of meeting people where they’re at in terms of conveying the reasons they should be interested in climate preparedness and using terminology that’s readily acceptable. You won’t hear me very often, unless I’m in front of a science group, use the words “resiliency” or “adaptation.” I think those are really wonky scientific terms that convey that we have more time than we do and they denote that this is something we’re thinking about for the next generation as opposed to now. I like the word “preparedness,” because when you talk about “storm preparedness” or “hazard preparedness” everyone wants more of that. They want to be better prepared. The other big thing is to find the folks in your cities and states that naturally have a longer-term perspective and work with them on partnerships at the outset, and then bring the rest of the folks on. In Boston, we’re blessed with a significant contingent of medical institutions and higher education institutions and they think in terms of 50-year plans. They’ve been around for 100 years and they want to be around for another 100 years, so they actually think in terms of long-term planning. Start with those types of institutions as your natural allies and then develop momentum and programs so that you can reach out to the broader community. Start with a coalition of those with a vested interest in the long-term vitality of your cities. Help us improve our content"

        "meta_description": "Richmond's citizen-scientists took to the streets on specially equipped bikes and cars to find out where it’s hottest—and where residents might be most vulnerable to extreme urban heat.",
        "content": "Richmond—the capital of Virginia—is situated on the James River amidst the low, rolling hills of the Virginia Piedmont. One of the nation’s oldest cities, Richmond boasts a population of almost 225,000. Walking through this dynamic city yields a wide range of culture, landscape...and temperatures. Similar to other cities across the mid-Atlantic region, Richmond experiences generally warm and humid summer days. And like other densely populated cities, the city experiences an urban heat island effect: unshaded roads and buildings across the city gain heat through the day and radiate it to the surroundings, increasing air temperature. As a result, highly developed areas experience warmer temperatures than surrounding areas. The inset image, taken with a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera, shows heat and is overlain on a regular photograph for context. In the FLIR image, lighter or brighter colors indicate warmer areas, while darker areas are cooler. While the urban heat island effect is generally described as a city being warmer than the surrounding rural areas, heat intensity can also vary from neighborhood to neighborhood within a city. For example, dark surfaces such as asphalt absorb more heat than lighter surfaces, and built materials such as bricks and concrete absorb more heat than grass and vegetation. This means that some sections of a city will face higher temperatures on hot days than others. This graph from the Climate Explorer shows observed and projected annual number of days above 95°F in Richmond. To explore similar data in your location, launch the . Excessive heat is recognized as the greatest weather-related cause of death in the United States (for more information, visit the and pages). Since the 1970s, residents of Richmond have experienced an increase in the number of days over 95°F per year, and climate scientists expect that trend to continue. On these hotter days, Richmond hospitals see an increase in heat-related emergency room visits. To identify which Richmond neighborhoods get the hottest during heat waves, and how excessive heat might affect the neighborhoods’ most vulnerable residents, researchers needed to come up with a way to check local temperatures—block by block—across the city. Dr. Jeremy Hoffman and Dr. Eugene Maurakis, scientists with the Science Museum of Virginia in Richmond, and Dr. Vivek Shandas, a professor of urban studies and planning at Portland State University, collaborated with Richmond community members, universities, and nonprofits to explore the city’s heat island effect. To assess urban heat in Richmond using methods developed by Shandas and his team at Portland State, they recruited citizen-scientists from several local organizations: students from the University of Richmond and Virginia Commonwealth University; the Virginia Academy of Science; the City of Richmond’s Sustainability Office; and Groundwork RVA, a Richmond nonprofit organization that engages young people with environmental and social issues in their communities. A youth volunteer from Groundwork RVA attaches a sensor unit onto a car. On July 13, 2017, in the midst of Richmond's first major heat wave of the summer, 15 teams of volunteers spread out through the city in cars and on bikes equipped with simple hand-made devices. Each device was designed to measure air temperature and mark time and location as it was moved along. By recording the temperature every second of each hour-long ride, and plotting those temperatures on a map, data from the devices could be used to generate a map of temperatures along each route over the entire city. Riders and drivers rolled through the heat on their assigned routes three times that day: at 6:00 am, at 3:00 pm, and again at 7:00 pm. All temperature and location data collected by the teams were fed into an open-source software package developed by Shandas’ team at Portland State. Processing the data this way allows researchers to relate different types of land use to air temperatures, even across areas that weren't directly measured. The resulting map showed a detailed picture of Richmond's urban heat across the entire city. The map showed differences of up to 16°F across Richmond’s neighborhoods during the hottest part of the day. This means that when a heavily shaded neighborhood in Richmond experiences an afternoon temperature of 87°F, it might reach 103°F in a more urbanized neighborhood in the same city. The data also revealed that warmer areas experienced a greater difference between morning and afternoon temperatures than did cooler areas. This map displays temperature data in Richmond from 3:00–4:00 pm on July 13, showing variable heat levels within the city depending on land use. Averaging measurements over census block groups and comparing the results with maps of land use showed that Richmond's warmest neighborhoods were generally those with the highest areas of impermeable surfaces and the lowest areas of tree canopy. These neighborhoods can sometimes be home to families with income levels below the poverty line—who may be more vulnerable to heat issues if they lack air conditioning. Not surprisingly, a review of locations where emergency responders typically respond to heat-related calls for help indicates that they are happening in these hottest areas, where people are most vulnerable. This map displays the urban heat vulnerability by census block group in Richmond. To quantify levels of urban heat vulnerability in different neighborhoods, researchers combined a range of factors with various weights into an index. Based on measurements of temperature, tree canopy, and concentration of impervious surfaces, and including census data on income levels, they defined a quantitative index that can help identify neighborhoods where residents may be at risk. Areas with a below-average index score show where adaptive action to decrease vulnerability to excessive heat may be most effective. Adaptive actions to consider in these areas might include planting more trees, creating artificial shade structures, or a longer-term strategy of changing building construction requirements, Many of the volunteers who participated in the heat mapping project also plan to be involved in bringing the findings to the public. Project participants are eager to take the next step by reaching out to neighborhoods where residents may be vulnerable to excessive heat events to help them develop tailored adaptation plans. Students use model homes to investigate differential heating in various surfaces. Groundwork RVA Green Team members—comprising local youth—have gained first-hand experience in understanding the way different surfaces absorb heat. In a project dubbed “Throwing Shade in RVA” using model homes in the Franklin Institute’s Ready Row Home exhibit, students used heat sensors and forward looking infrared (FLIR) cameras to measure and visualize heating differences among surfaces of various colors. Focusing on potential solutions that would incorporate the concept of green infrastructure, students designed a shade structure. The Throwing Shade project was partially funded by NOAA's Office of Education Environmental Literacy Program, and the Franklin Institute's Ready Row Home exhibit is provided through the Climate & Urban Systems Partnership, funded by the National Science Foundation. The ultimate goal of the heat mapping project is to promote the development of community-scale adaptation, and the limited reach of the study is what makes it unique. Satellites can provide a picture of urban heat islands the size of cities and on city surfaces, but those images can't show variations in air temperatures across neighborhoods or on the streets. Conditions in the places where human activity takes place is what matters most in this project. Keeping a strong focus on the human element—on volunteer citizen-scientists, on cars and bikes, in their own city—resulted in a human-relevant and detailed dataset that’s not available from other sources. With this hazard and vulnerability information, the next stage of this project—following the —will examine mitigation scenarios for providing cool locations in new and existing developments within the hottest parts of the city. The alternative development scenarios can be coupled with other priorities to cool neighborhoods, and ultimately save infrastructure and lives. Data from this project are currently being used to inform planning phase discussions about Richmond 300, a citywide master plan update; RVA Green 2050, a greenhouse gas emissions reduction plan; and the implementation of RVAH2O, a watershed management program focused on reducing stormwater runoff. Relevant city departments are also committing to collaborations with the Museum for ongoing climate resilience education initiatives and proposals. With projections of warming summers, the effects of urban heat islands on communities will likely be a growing concern across the country. Richmond’s Urban Heat Vulnerability assessment can be replicated in other locations: it used data records from the National Land Cover Database and the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, data available for nearly every city in the United States, and processed that data using open source code in R, a free statistical computation environment. All of these elements—from active participation of local citizen-scientists to using open-source software to collect and model data—make the heat mapping research in Richmond applicable to other cities across the United States.

By removing accumlated fuels, fire makes room for new growth and change. This renewal helps ensure the quality of traditional foods and cultural materials and serves as a medium of cultural education. Ceremonies surrounding fire strengthen the Tribe's social networks and enhance its members' physical and mental health. The Karuk tribe's ancestral lands (outlined in yellow) along the Klamath River in northern California, northwest of Redding.. Natural-color satellite image from NASA's Terra satellite on August 31, 2014, during the time of the Happy Camp Fire, the state's largest fire that year. The Tribe's proactive cultural use of fire also protects the Klamath River basin by reducing the availability of forest fuels—and thus reducing the risk of high-severity wildfire that can threaten people, their homes and businesses, and natural systems such as forests and wetlands near rivers and streams. Wildland systems in the Klamath River range have evolved alongside Karuk management practices for thousands of years. Tribal families continue to use traditional forest management techniques—including low-intensity prescribed burns—to cultivate the forest to become a more productive resource for food and cultural materials to reduce the availability of forest fuels. Tribal programs support and expand upon their work. Tanoak acorns (xuntápan) are a staple Native food for many indigenous people and are also vital for numerous wildlife species. Additionally, the roots of tanoak trees support the growth of another important food, tanoak mushrooms. Tanoak (xunyêep) is very susceptible to high-intensity fire, but benefits from cultural burning that decreases tree and acorn pests and reduces competitive vegetation. Photo courtesy the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. Indigenous burning is increasingly recognized as a component of the ecosystem and a restoration technique. Fire is important for restoring grasslands for elk, managing for food sources such as tan and black oak acorns, maintaining quality basketry materials, and producing smoke that can shade the river for fish. Karuk fire regimes generate what is known as \"pyrodiversity\"—the biodiversity consequences of fire management—on the landscape by extending the burning season and shortening the intervals of fire return. The multitude of foods, materials, and other products that come from Karuk lands are evidence of the profound diversity of fire regimes that are required to maintain relationships with hundreds of animal, plant, and mushroom species. Beargrass—or panyúrar in Karuk—is an important species for basket weavers and regalia makers. The blades that grow the first year after a fire are considered best for basket weaving. Panyúrar can be stimulated by fire, and is fire-adapted in that it can sprout from rhizomes following fire or re-establish by seed. At the same time, panyúrar can be damaged by fires that burn too hot. Photo courtesy the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. Since European contact, non-native use and management of the region has severely impacted the Karuk people's access to cultural, ceremonial, and food resources. The region's changing climate has exacerbated these effects, and the Karuk are now experiencing a decline in the abundance of key species, including salmon, acorns, huckleberries, hazel, and willow. Natural disasters and hazards ranging from increasing frequency of high-severity wildfire to flooding and mudslides are on the rise—generating a range of negative human health outcomes for the Karuk people. In order to adapt to these and other ongoing challenges, the Karuk people are working to revitalize the Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) inextricably tied to their ability to physically apply resource management practices. Fire has been a primary tool in Karuk wildland management systems, and the Tribe maintains that the age-old tradition of prescribed burning holds the answer to climate adaptation planning in the Klamath River range. The Tribe has researched and published two reports concerning social and environmental climate changes and the long-term effects the Karuk people are facing with regard to knowledge sovereignty and the vulnerability of their TEK, supported by the 2015 Tribal Cooperative Landscape Conservation Program administered by the .

For example, the U.S. Forest Service, a federal agency, makes decisions about prescribed burning within the Klamath and Six Rivers National Forests. The report provides strategies to promote traditional knowledge sovereignty, including reference to the . Tribal leaders believe that it is possible to create a meaningful collaboration with the Forest Service, the Klamath National Forest, and the Six Rivers National Forest that upholds and strengthens tribal sovereignty and recognizes the legitimacy of the Karuk’s practical ability to carry out traditional management to restore the Klamath to a safe and productive state of health. In addition to the reports mentioned above, the Tribe has also undertaken and published the (CVA), which addresses vulnerabilities to Karuk traditional foods and cultural use species, tribal program infrastructure, and management authority and political status that result from the increasing frequency of high-severity fire. The CVA makes the case that Karuk tribal knowledge and management principles regarding the use of fire can be utilized to reduce the likelihood of high-severity fires and thereby protect public, as well as tribal, trust resources.

In 2015, Nags Head initiated a comprehensive planning effort with direction from the Nags Head Board of Commissioners to explore and develop policy for sea level rise in their planning efforts. Mayor Robert Edwards summed up the motivation for the town to act: “We can’t ignore what is happening and what will continue to happen with sea level rise. It is imperative that as we plan for the future, we explore how to build, preserve infrastructure, and meet community needs in light of rising sea level.” Nags Head undertook a planning process designed to help the barrier island community become more resilient to storms, sea level rise, and other coastal hazards.

Concurrently, the Town of Nags Head partnered with North Carolina Sea Grant to work with community members to better understand the town’s vulnerabilities to coastal hazards, including sea level rise. Dr. Jessica Whitehead, North Carolina Sea Grant Community Hazards Adaptations Specialist, led a team to implement the Vulnerability Consequences and Adaptation Planning Scenario (VCAPS) tool in an open public planning process. VCAPS is intended to engage community members and seek their input on potential coastal hazards, such as sea level rise. Approximately 60 people participated in a two-day community workshop. Starting with the VCAPS building blocks, participants communicated what they felt were hazards, potential consequences of the hazards, and potential public and private actions to adapt to or mitigate the issues identified.

It has opened my eyes to look at how we integrate all of this. Regardless of cause, we need to have it mapped and integrated.” Based on information and outcomes from the VCAPS process, the town established a Coastal Resiliency and Sea Level Rise Committee in 2016. This committee reviewed the VCAPS diagrams and worked to consolidate and prioritize over 160 possible adaptation actions suggested by the public into a report. The adaptation actions related to sea level rise and other coastal hazards were broken into four main categories: ocean management, estuarine shoreline management, stormwater management, and water (ground/surface) management. These adaptation actions developed through community involvement formed the foundation for policy in the town’s comprehensive plan.

While there has been a great deal of work on other coastal hazards, this is the starting point for learning how sea level rise will impact the town and determining possible adaptation actions,” said Holly White, Principal Planner with the Town of Nags Head.

Through the use of the VCAPS process during the Comprehensive Planning efforts, the town is ensuring preservation of its culture, history, vast natural resources, and way of life. In addition to a section on coastal resiliency and sea level rise in the recently adopted comprehensive plan, the town is continuing to work with North Carolina Sea Grant and other partners to implement adaptive actions. One of the first actions the town will undertake, in coordination with the University of Georgia and Stetson University, is to map potential damage from storms and sea level rise to understand and visualize consequences and investigate legal and policy barriers to adaptation.

        "content": "For much of its history, our planet has been hotter—sometimes —than it is today. But our planet has also been colder. Scientists may never know which period in our planet’s 4.54-billion-year history was the absolute coldest, but research has revealed a few contenders. All of these periods have been identified as ancient ice ages. Some of the coldest conditions struck over 2 billion years ago, after the rise of atmospheric oxygen. More deep freezes occurred between 750 and 600 million years ago. Although scientists debate exactly how extensive the ice coverage was during these times, the evidence indicates that ice reached sea level in equatorial regions. In the past few million years, glaciers have blanketed huge expanses of the Northern Hemisphere off and on. Though less severe than the near-global glaciations, the Pleistocene ice ages may have brought the coldest conditions in the last half a billion years. Some of the worst cold struck about 20,000 years ago. The has been identified as a high ridge between Dome Argus and Dome Fuji in East Antarctica.

An ice age is a period of colder-than-usual global temperatures and bigger-than-usual glaciers and ice sheets. Ice ages don’t bring unrelenting cold. Instead, relatively warm periods intervene, so ice ages are a mix of advancing glaciers (glacials) and retreating glaciers (interglacials). Though relatively warm, interglacials are still part of a glacial epoch. How do scientists know ancient ice ages happened? Clearly, thermometers weren’t handy when continental-scale glaciers advanced toward the equator. The evidence for past ice ages comes instead from geology. Soon after the scientific discipline emerged in the early 19th century, geologists began finding clues left by ancient ice bodies. Glaciers, geologists realized, could leave giant scratch marks on bedrock and carry boulders to distant landscapes, often dropping those rocks at sea. Once the signs of glaciation were recognized for the Pleistocene Epoch (roughly 2.6 million to 11,000 years ago), geologists knew how to recognize them in older rocks. Combining the evidence for glaciation with the evidence for plate tectonics and continental drift has enabled geologists to identify glacial activity from hundreds of millions of years ago, when continents were configured very differently. After years of explaining geologic phenomena as the result of the Noachian flood, the 19th-century British geologist William Buckland accepted the evidence for glacial action. He became a proponent of the Ice Age theory. Image credit: . In all, scientists have identified upwards of a dozen ice ages in the geologic record, several of them in the last half a billion years. Some of the ice ages that struck even earlier were worse, probably the worst ice ages in our planet’s history. Among the earliest ice ages so far found in the geological record are the Huronian ice ages. At least one of them constituted what geologists call a Snowball Earth event, when the planet’s surface was entirely, or almost entirely, frozen. Interspersed with non-glacial periods, the ice ages occurred between 2.4 and 2.1 billion years ago, and probably resulted from changes in microscopic life. Paleontologists surmise that when microbial life arose on Earth over 3.5 billion years ago, microbes neither made nor needed oxygen. Instead, when life evolved, Earth’s atmosphere was very different from what we experience today. Although nitrogen levels may have been similar, other gases were much more—or much less—abundant. Carbon dioxide was anywhere from 10 to 2,500 times present levels, and methane may have been as much as 10,000 times higher than present levels. Atmospheric oxygen was virtually nonexistent. Before oxygen accumulated in Earth’s atmosphere, our planet probably looked not like a pale blue dot but instead like a pale orange dot. Image credit: . Scientists debate when exactly microbes capable of carrying out photosynthesis and making oxygen as a byproduct first evolved. Estimates range from about 3.5 to 2.5 billion years ago. The earliest oxygen makers were probably ancestors of modern cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae. At first, the oxygen produced by these early photosynthesizers probably reacted with iron in the ocean, settling into layers of rusty sediment on the seafloor before starting to accumulate in the atmosphere. Some oxygen reacted with methane, converting it to carbon dioxide and water. Meanwhile, photosynthesizing microbe populations kept growing, consuming more carbon dioxide. Ancestors of modern cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) may have been the first oxygen producers on planet Earth, and ushered in significant changes in climate. CC license by Flickr user . Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and methane is an even more potent greenhouse gas. As atmospheric concentrations of these greenhouse gases dropped, global temperatures plummeted, plunging the planet into a series of ice ages. The Huronian ice ages and non-glacial periods separating them likely lasted a total of 300 million years. Evidence suggests these glaciations reached equatorial regions at sea level. (Ice occurs in equatorial regions today, but only at high elevations.) Geologic evidence of these ice ages was first discovered in 1907, in glacial deposits near Lake Huron. Since then, geologists have discovered more evidence elsewhere in North America, as well as in South Africa, Western Australia, and northeastern Europe. Found near Whitefish Falls, Ontario, along the northern shore of Lake Huron, this dropstone landed in seafloor sediments under a floating glacier some 2.2 billion years ago. Image from , photo by D.A. Lindsey, USGS. The rise of oxygen did more than freeze the planet. It also enabled the evolution of oxygen-breathing complex life, and formed Earth’s ozone layer, which helps protect life from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Brutal cold struck again during stretch of Earth’s history known as the Cryogenian Period. At least twice between 750 and 600 million years ago, Earth fell into a deep freeze. Because the Cryogenian Period events occurred during a longer geologic era known as the Neoproterozoic Era, the deep freezes are sometimes referred to as the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earths. Scientists continue to debate the causes of Neoproterozoic freezes and the subsequent thaws. Volcanoes may be the force that both pushed the planet into the glaciations and also pulled it out. About 750 million years ago, most continents were clustered around the equator. Within this continental mix, geologists have identified evidence of what they call a . \"Large\" is an understatement—imagine a volcanically active area the size of a continent. Eruptions in this province could have cooled the planet in two ways. Evidence of the once-equatorial large igneous province that may have kickstarted the Cryogenian is preserved in Nunavut, Canada. Sills—intrusions of volcanic material into older rock layers—cut across older, sand-colored rock. The bands in the lighter rock result from the coastline rising after the glaciers that had weighed down the coast retreated. Image from . When volcanoes release sulfur dioxide, the gas undergoes chemical reactions in the atmosphere to form highly reflective sulfates—particles that block out sunlight, like billions of tiny mirrors. Sulfates’ cooling potential is especially strong around Earth’s equator. Likewise, when volcanoes extrude large volumes of basalt, the rock weathering that follows can cool the planet. Over time, rain, wind, and chemical changes all eat away at volcanic rocks. Rainwater and groundwater percolating through rock can dissolve carbon dioxide, stripping it from the atmosphere and ultimately trapping it as carbonate minerals such as limestone. If global temperatures drop quickly enough, ice starts to build up, and ice’s ability to reflect most sunlight back into space cools the planet even further. Geologists have identified two glaciations during the Neoproterozoic: the Sturtian (about 720 to 660 million years ago) and the Marinoan (about 640 to 635 million years ago). Rock layers from these times show the most extensive evidence of extreme glaciations so far found in the geologic record. In between these deep freezes, Earth appears to have endured an equally remarkable . This climate extreme, too, might be down to volcanic activity. Over the long term, volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide and the depletion of carbon dioxide by weathering of rocks can keep each other in check. But as ice enrobed most of the planet hundreds of millions of years ago, weathering probably slowed as conditions turned too cold for heavy precipitation. Meanwhile, increased sea ice would have reduced cyanobacteria’s access to sunlight at the ocean surface, reducing photosynthesis. Under its icy surface, Saturn’s frozen-ocean moon Enceladus may harbor liquid water and the ingredients necessary for life. If the most extreme ice ages in Earth history were true Snowball Earth events—with no open ocean—our planet may have looked like a supersized version of Enceladus. Image courtesy . Volcanoes, however, kept cranking out carbon dioxide. With little rock-weathering or photosynthetic activity left to draw from the atmosphere, the greenhouse gas would have accumulated, leading to a gradual increase in global temperatures. Once conditions warmed enough to melt tropical ice, the temperature increase would have accelerated. After losing a significant amount of light-reflecting ice, the planet would have absorbed much more of the Sun’s energy. The subsequent big melt might have caused such dramatic, rapid weathering that it led to the second glaciation. As in the Huronian, glaciations of the Cryogenian Period reached sea level at the equator. But just how complete the Neoproterozoic ice coverage was—whether it was a or a —remains an area of active research. The rock record indicates that nothing as extensive as the Huronian and Cryogenian glaciations has happened in the last 500 million years, even though geologists have found evidence of several more ice ages. Although it has some competition from cold conditions occurring between 300 and 250 million years ago, the most significant ice age in the last half a billion years may be the most recent. Striking during the time period known as the Pleistocene Epoch, this ice age started about 2.6 million years ago and lasted until roughly 11,000 years ago. Like all the others, the most recent ice age brought a series of glacial advances and retreats. In fact, we are technically still in an ice age. We’re just living out our lives during an interglacial. All of human civilization—everything from the earliest scripts such as cuneiform to smartphones and tweets—has occurred within an interglacial. CC license by Flickr user / Wikimedia Commons. About 50 million years ago, the planet was too warm for polar ice caps, but Earth has mostly been cooling ever since. Starting about 34 million years ago, the Antarctic Ice Sheet began to form. This might be down to South America separating from Antarctica, opening up the Drake Passage. Besides nauseating generations of ocean travelers, the Drake Passage opening created the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Circling the now-frozen continent, the current may have reduced the amount of ocean heat reaching Antarctica, enabling Antarctic ice to form and grow. Wind and waves make trips through the Drake Passage memorable. Its appearance due to plate tectonics maybe have contributed to the development of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. CC license by Flickr user . Another land movement likely plunged the planet into its most recent ice age. The Isthmus of Panama, the land bridge between North and South America, formed about 4.5 million years ago. Prior to its formation, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans freely exchanged tropical waters. By cutting off that exchange and sending warm, salty ocean water northward, the isthmus increased precipitation at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Snow accumulated into glaciers and eventually into ice sheets. These massive, sunlight-deflecting ice bodies continued the planet’s cooling trend. Once Earth was cold enough for ice sheets to form, they waxed and waned over timescales of about 20,000 to 100,000 years, due partly to Milankovitch Cycles. These largely predictable changes in Earth’s orbit include eccentricity (changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun), obliquity (changes in the tilt of Earth’s axis), and precession (wobbling of Earth’s axis of rotation). They affect climate by changing the distribution of incoming solar energy on Earth’s surface. Roughly 20,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum of the Pleistocene Ice Age, ice spread over much of North America and Eurasia. (High-resolution without annotations .) Image by Climate.gov based on data from the , provided by The latest ice age peaked about 20,000 years ago, when global temperatures were likely about 10°F (5°C) colder than today. At the Pleistocene Ice Age’s peak, massive ice sheets stretched over North America and Eurasia. We can thank these ice sheets and their associated melt events for the Great Lakes, Niagara Falls, and even the in Washington and Oregon. Meltwater began spilling over the Niagara Escarpment some 12,000 years ago. Today, roughly 3,160 tons of water flows over Niagara Falls every second, a long-lasting legacy of the Pleistocene Ice Age. CC license by Flickr user . When will the massive ice sheets once again advance toward the equator? They might not return on any schedule Milankovitch Cycles would predict. The cycles have varying effects on global climate, some stronger than others. When atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeds 300 parts per million, the gas’s heat-retention ability is strong enough to overwhelm more subtle cycles. Atmospheric carbon dioxide now exceeds 400 parts per million, and because carbon dioxide is a long-lived gas, levels at least that high may persist for thousands of years. That doesn’t mean there will never be another ice age, but its onset may be delayed. Bekker, A. (2014). Huronian Glaciation. In (pp. 1–8). Springer Berlin Heidelberg. Catling, D. C., Zahnle, K. J.

En realidad, desde diversos puntos de vista, es más difícil pronosticar el tiempo para dentro de dos semanas que pronosticar el clima con décadas de anticipación.

Los modelos climáticos no intentan, por ejemplo, pronosticar la temperatura máxima diurna exacta en Chicago (Illinois) el 15 de agosto de 2035. Están tratando de pronosticar la temperatura máxima diurna promedio para el mes de agosto durante toda la década de 2030. Y mientras que las condiciones climáticas exactas en un lugar determinado pueden cambiar bruscamente de un momento a otro, el clima promedio cambia mucho menos de un año a otro o incluso de una década a otra.

From a purely physical perspective, any reduction in emissions helps minimize future temperature increases. From the perspective of fairness, the United States has released more heat-trapping gases to date than either China or India, the world’s two most populous countries. Carbon dioxide is a long-lived greenhouse gas that can linger in Earth’s atmosphere for thousands of years. Consequently, the United States bears more responsibility for the amount of warming that has occurred so far and will persist for millennia. Global carbon emissions began to rise measurably in the mid-nineteenth century. Total U.S. emissions still remained above China’s and India’s through 2021. Credit: Our World in Data The United States, along with close to 200 other countries, is a party to the . The agreement aims to limit “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C [3.6 ˚F] above pre-industrial levels.” Participating nations also agree to try “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C [2.7 ˚F] above pre-industrial levels.” To meet these goals, humans can emit only so much more carbon dioxide, whether through fossil fuel burning, cement production, or land use change. Just as a household working with limited financial resources must adhere to a financial budget, nations trying to limit further warming must collectively adhere to a carbon budget. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons—one gigaton is a billion metric tons—per year in the mid-20 century before skyrocketing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric CO data from and . CO emissions data from and the . In —part of its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released estimates of the allowable carbon emissions from the start of 2020. To have a 50 percent chance of capping global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the group estimated that humanity should limit emissions to no more than 500 billion metric tons. For a 50 percent chance of capping global warming at 2.0°C above pre-industrial levels, humans should limit emissions to 1,350 billion metric tons. To raise the odds of hitting those targets, we would have to emit even less. Unfortunately, most of the estimated global carbon budget for the 1.5°C target has been spent. The AR6 concluded that humans had already burned through about four-fifths of the budget. In November 2022, the of the allowable carbon emissions to limit further warming. Taking into account the continued emissions since the IPCC AR6 publication, the Global Carbon Project estimated that maintaining a 50 percent chance of meeting the 1.5°C target meant limiting future emissions to 380 billion metric tons. Maintaining a 50 percent chance of meeting the 2°C target meant limiting future emissions to 1,230 billion metric tons. Each pie chart shows how much carbon dioxide the world has already added to the atmosphere through 2022 (gray) and how much additional carbon dioxide we can add (orange) if we want at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to (left to right) 1.5, 1.7, or 2.0 degrees Celsius (2.7, 3, or 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial global average temperature. Most of what we can emit and still keep temperatures below these amounts has already been released. Image provided by the Global Carbon Project. Used under a Creative Commons license. Some countries have spent much more of the budget than others. The Industrial Revolution began in the mid-eighteenth century, and global carbon dioxide emissions began rising measurably about a century later. Western Europe industrialized early, as did parts of the United States and Canada. Further boosting carbon emissions throughout the nineteenth century, waves of European settlers cleared forest for farmland in the United States and Canada. By comparison, China and India have been relative latecomers to industrialization, although China is ramping up quickly. Even so, both countries have remained behind the United States in per person emissions and total cumulative emissions. In fact, at China’s 2021 rate of 11.47 gigatons per year, it would take roughly 15 years to match the U.S. historical contribution. At India’s 2021 rate of 2.71 gigatons per year, it would take about 135 years to catch up to the United States. Annual carbon dioxide emissions from selected developed and developing countries from 1850-2021. Until the start of the new millennium in 2000, the United States (black line) emitted more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year than any other country, including all the countries of the European Union combined.(orange line). Since the mid-2000s, China's annual emissions (red line) have been the world's largest. Graph from , based on data from the Global Carbon Project. In 1973, U.S. per capita carbon dioxide emissions were 20 times those of China’s and 66 times those of India’s. By the year 2000, when many U.S. policymakers and consumers were aware of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, U.S. per person emissions had dropped to just over 21 metric tons per year, while China’s and India’s had risen to 2.9 and 0.9 respectively. That meant U.S. per person emissions were seven times those of China’s and 23 times those of India’s. Since then, the United States' per person emission rate has continued to drop, but the country's 2021 per person carbon dioxide emissions were still nearly twice as large as China's and nearly 8 times as large as India's. (Explore these and other comparisons through the interactive charts and maps at the excellent site.) The United States lowered per capita carbon dioxide emissions starting in the 1970s, but still led both China and India through 2021. Credit: Our World in Data Furthermore, national emissions are not wholly independent of each other. Much of China’s rising emissions are related to manufacturing, with many of the resulting products increasingly purchased by American consumers. The United States imported $450.4 billion worth of goods from China in 2020 alone, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. ( allows users to view emissions adjusted by production and consumption of imported and exported goods.) If we agree to the premise that each country is entitled to use up a chunk of the remaining carbon budget that’s proportional to its population, the United States has nothing left to spend. In fact, the United States has overspent, according to a . The study tallied historical emissions by country, divided each nation’s carbon budget by world population to arrive at a per person carbon budget, then multiplied the per person budget by national population. By this measure, the United States has overspent its carbon budget by roughly 346 billion metric tons. found that Russia, the European Union, and the world’s highest per person emitters at present (Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait) have also exceeded their carbon budgets. The United States’ big population partially contributes to national carbon overspending, but keep in mind that China and India each have roughly four times the U.S. population. As of 2021, according to , the United States population was 337 million while China’s was 1.43 billion and India’s was 1.41 billion. In short, the United States bears a greater share of the responsibility for current conditions—on both a national and per-person level. The world can only emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide if we want a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to no more than 2°C (3.6 ˚F) above pre-industrial temperatures. ( ) The location of the dots indicates how much carbon dioxide a country has already emitted (vertical axis, in billions of metric tons) versus its remaining population-based budget (horizontal axis). The United States, Brazil, Russia, and the European Union plus the United Kingdom (EU28) are all above the red diagonal line, meaning they have already \"overspent.\" China and India are below the line, which means they have emitted less carbon dioxide to date than they would be allowed based on their population. ( ) Red and gray bars compare how much a country has already emitted (red) and how much of its budget remains (gray). U.S. emissions to date dwarf its remaining national budget. NOAA Climate.gov graphic by Ben Everett-Lane, based on data from Our World in Data and World Bank. Rising emissions from China and India could eventually overshadow total U.S. emissions, and could easily push global warming past the 1.5°C goal, and even past the 2°C goal. This looming possibility might make U.S. emission reductions seem pointless, but they are not. If heat-trapping emissions continue, where they originate won’t matter nearly as much as how big they are and how long they continue.

A temperature increase of 2.5°C is better than 3°C, which is better than 3.5°C, and so on. Even though the United States no longer leads the world in total annual carbon dioxide emissions, it was still, as of 2021, releasing per year, which was about 13.49 percent of the total global emissions—more than twice that of all 28 countries in the European Union combined. Those emissions will continue to drive global warming. Combined with the contribution that past U.S. emissions have made to warming to date, any future U.S. emissions will undermine progress to stop global warming. Environmental Protection Agency. .

        "content": "Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) refers to deliberate, large-scale actions intended to decrease global average surface temperatures by increasing the reflection of sunlight away from the Earth. SRM is not considered a substitute for climate mitigation efforts, which include decarbonization and greenhouse gas emission cuts. Research into the viability and effectiveness of SRM methods and potential unintended consequences provide a foundation for decisions regarding the implementation of SRM. Proposed SRM methods involve the use of aerosols (small particles) or other materials to increase the reflectivity of the atmosphere, clouds, or Earth’s surface. These methods have the potential to lower surface temperatures more quickly than carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods and reduce some risks posed by climate change, while posing other risks still to be understood. The single largest driver of climate change in the industrial era has been human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO ), a long-lived (GHG). SRM research is being conducted as a response to growing concerns that the pace of CO emissions reductions and CDR technology development is not sufficient to avoid severe impacts of climate change in the next decades. Research into the viability and effectiveness of SRM methods and potential unintended consequences provide a foundation for decisions regarding the implementation of SRM. By contrast, GHGs warm surface temperatures by trapping a portion of outgoing terrestrial radiation that would otherwise be emitted into space. SRM methods reduce surface warming without addressing the fundamental cause—rising levels of atmospheric GHGs—and thus do not offset all of the impacts of carbon emissions. based on a combination of projected feasibility and estimated cost. To date, far less research has been performed on other proposed methods for modifying Earth’s radiation budget Figure 1. Proposed methods for modifying Earth’s radiation budget, including SRM methods and cirrus cloud thinning. : a strategy for increasing the number of small reflective aerosols in the stratosphere to increase the reflection of incoming sunlight. : a strategy for adding aerosol to the lower atmosphere over ocean regions to increase the reflectivity of low-lying marine clouds. a strategy for modifying the properties of high altitude ice clouds to increase the transmission of outgoing terrestrial radiation to space. increasing the reflectivity of surfaces through, for example, white roofs or land-cover changes. proposed methods have primarily considered large “mirrors” in space to reflect sunlight. either by direct injection or by injection of a precursor gas (such as sulfur dioxide, SO ) that would subsequently react in the stratosphere to form aerosols. Proposed aerosol types include sulfate, calcium carbonate, and diamond dust. by increasing the number of small cloud droplets. SRM research centers on developing and studying a range of potential future scenarios that combine emissions reductions, CDR, and SRM to varying degrees and over varying timescales. In one such scenario, commonly called “peak-shaving” (illustrated in , SRM would be implemented as a temporary method alongside strong GHG emission cuts and aggressive CDR to stabilize global temperatures and offset some of the most negative impacts of climate change. Figure 2. Schematic diagram representing the concept of peak-shaving. Different lines illustrate the global mean temperatures for future scenarios. Blue arrows represent the relative magnitude of the temperature impact of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). Side effects of SRM are driven by complex chemical, radiative, and dynamical interactions, such as changes to the hydrologic cycle and clouds, or effects on ecosystems, agricultural production, and the carbon cycle. Additional by SAI and alterations to the El Niño Southern Oscillation by MCB are also possible. The potential risks and benefits to human health and well-being and to ecosystems from SRM need to be evaluated and assessed relative to those associated with plausible trajectories of ongoing climate change without SRM (i.e., using risk vs. risk analysis). Current understanding of risks and benefits is limited by uncertainties in the observations and modeling tools used to examine SRM impacts. GHG-induced warming and SRM-induced cooling are different physical mechanisms; therefore, In fact, effects of climate change on regional weather patterns will not be fully mitigated by SRM. Some regions could experience cooler or wetter conditions, and others warmer or drier conditions, compared to a climate without SRM. In addition, will persist unabated if GHG emissions continue. Recent studies on SRM indicate that some of the negative impacts can be reduced through design of an optimal injection strategy (i.e. location, magnitude, and timing of injection). These efforts have demonstrated the basic efficacy of SRM for cooling Earth’s surface temperatures, while also identifying a number of gaps and uncertainties in our current understanding, as well as potential unintended outcomes. Climate models differ in simulating large-scale aerosol climate effects, including on surface temperatures, due to variations in how aerosol processes, atmospheric transport and mixing, and physics are represented. There remain large uncertainties as to the changes in large scale circulation, regional climate, air quality, and weather, associated with SRM. Research on low-level clouds has also revealed , so the net climate effect of injecting aerosols into the lower atmosphere for MCB is difficult to project. A fundamental challenge of SRM is the technological requirement to implement any strategy at the scale required to achieve appreciable global cooling. Both SAI and MCB would require development of reliable methods for producing aerosols of a specific size and uniformity, in addition to the platforms/vehicles needed for deployment (e.g., ships, high altitude aircraft/balloons). Aerosols are removed from the atmosphere by natural processes on timescales of a few days in the troposphere and a few years in the stratosphere. An SRM strategy like peak-shaving would require ongoing deployment until such time that the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs are sufficiently reduced. Ceasing actions abruptly when injections are large could lead to a more rapid climate change (termination shock) than would have occurred in the absence of SRM. SRM also raises concerns of intergenerational equity by committing future generations to continue on a path they did not choose. Climate change raises geopolitical risks, and SRM deployment could also add significant geopolitical risks. Implementing SRM may positively impact some locations and negatively impact others. This uneven distribution of benefits and negative consequences introduces potentially significant justice and geopolitical concerns. Currently, no universally accepted governance framework provides oversight for SRM research or implementation. Substantial knowledge gaps and uncertainties exist in many critical areas of SRM research, particularly related to the social sciences. All activities occur within existing authorizations for Federal science agencies. The US Government is not engaged in any form of outdoor testing or deployment of SRM techniques and does not condone or endorse SRM deployment. Any activities intending to modify weather or Earth’s solar radiation (i.e., SRM) are required to be reported to NOAA under the . NOAA keeps track of the reports submitted, and maintains them for public access in the NOAA Library. NOAA conducts observations and modeling research on the climate system and the detailed atmospheric and oceanic processes that drive it. Researching how SRM may change the climate system is part of NOAA’s mission. NOAA observations provide important constraints on and verification of NOAA modeling and projection capabilities, which, in turn, enable the exploration of future climate scenarios that allow for examining and understanding impacts, options, and tradeoffs. Following a Congressional directive implemented in 2020, NOAA is leading the ERB program—a multi-year research program to investigate natural and human activities (e.g., volcanoes, wildfire pyrocumulous, space industry emissions, ship tracks, and SRM) that might alter the composition and reflectivity of the atmosphere. The ERB program has funded research projects relevant to SRM both within NOAA labs and with external collaborators. These projects include: model development, model studies of SRM efficacy and impacts, laboratory studies of stratospheric aerosol materials, novel instrument development, observations of stratospheric aerosol using , and (UAS) measurements of aerosol-cloud interactions in marine clouds. The (Stratospheric Aerosol processes, Budget and Radiative Effects) project, ERB’s flagship stratospheric measurement effort, is a multi-year airborne research campaign using high altitude research aircraft to collect the detailed observations of stratospheric composition and chemistry necessary for improving chemistry–climate models and narrowing the uncertainty in model projections of SAI impacts.

        "title": "U.S. climate outlook for November 2024 | NOAA Climate.gov",
        "meta_description": "October 2024 is likely to be one of the driest months ever recorded for the country. Will these dry conditions persist into November or will autumn precipitation make a return to portions of the country?",
        "content": "Despite another warmer-than-normal month over most of the Unites States, the big story during October was the extremely dry conditions observed almost coast to coast. With the exceptions of peninsular Florida, which Hurricane Milton pummeled with upwards of 6 inches of rain in a single day, the extreme Pacific Northwest, and small parts of the Southwest, the remainder of the contiguous U.S. generally received less than 50% of normal precipitation, with some parts of the eastern U.S. receiving virtually no rainfall during the month. Although records haven’t been finalized, October 2024 is likely to be one of the driest months ever recorded for the country. Not surprisingly, the very dry month resulted in a large increase in drought coverage. Will dryness continue over much of the nation during November? And despite fall featuring generally warmer-than-average months thus far, will winter get off to an early start with some colder-than-normal temperatures? Read ahead to find out what NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) predicts for November. The U.S. temperature outlook for November 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for November or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean , not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average November. or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average November temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. On October 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for November 2024. The temperature outlook favors well above across the central and eastern parts of the nation, as well as in northern Alaska. The precipitation outlook favors well above in the Pacific Northwest, across parts of the central U.S., and in southern Alaska, with below-average precipitation only favored right along the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine and in extreme southern Louisiana. The precipitation outlook for November 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean , not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average November. or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total November precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. If you decide to keep reading (and I hope you do), I’ll provide more specific information about the outlooks and what they are based on, discuss the changes in drought during October, and present the drought outlook for November. Finally, my ever-present reminder: the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps provide information about the outcome, but other outcomes are also possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found . The updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC’s own 6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month included longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), and the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. Although , expectations that it will soon played a small role in the November outlooks. The has remained active, but its typical impacts on the U.S. (cool conditions in the East) are out of phase with model guidance later in the month (which predicts above-average temperatures), so the main impact from the MJO was to moderate the model-based probabilities. The November temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across all of the central and eastern parts of the nation and in northern Alaska. ( means “in the warmest third of all Novembers in the recent climate record.”) No parts of the Lower 48 states are favored to have a colder-than-average month, although temperatures in southern Alaska are slightly favored to be below average, and with e odds (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) found in the western part of the country. The greatest odds for a warmer-than-average November are found in the eastern parts of the nation, with probabilities exceeding 50%. These probabilities might have been even higher, as official outlooks during all periods (WPC’s Week-1, and CPC’s Week-2 and Week 3-4) favor above-average temperatures. However, in the longer term for this region, injecting some uncertainty into the longer-range outlook. Likewise, the equal chance forecast in the West is somewhat dependent on typical impacts in that area when the MJO is \"upstream\" in the Pacific. Those favor average to above-average temperatures, while the official longer-range outlooks have a slight tilt in the odds toward below-average temperatures, continuing expectations for below-average temperatures expected during the beginning of the month. Across Alaska, trends favor above-average temperatures along the northern coast, while La Niña favors cooler-than-average temperatures along the southern Alaskan mainland and panhandle. However, November looks to begin above average in southern Alaska, so probabilities for below-normal temperatures for the month are quite modest. The precipitation outlook for November favors above-average rainfall across parts of the central U.S., in the Pacific Northwest, and in southern Alaska. The highest odds extend from the Southern Plains to the Great Lakes (greater than 50%), where forecasts for the first week of the month predict 2-5 inches of rain. Early month activity and the developing La Niña favor above-normal precipitation across the Pacific Northwest and southern portions of Alaska, including the Alaskan Panhandle. Below-average rainfall is only slightly favored along parts of the Eastern Seaboard and in extreme southern Louisiana. A dry start to the month along the East Coast, combined with Week-2 and Week 3-4 outlooks of near or below-average precipitation is enough to favor below-average precipitation from North Carolina to Maine. However, probabilities are low with uncertainty high, as the Madden-Julian Oscillation would favor troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) across the middle of the nation, potentially bringing moisture northward and eastward during the middle and latter parts of the month. Drought conditions across the contiguous United States as of October 29, 2024. Pockets of extreme (red) and exceptional (dark red) drought were present in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Ohio, and West Virginia. Many locations were at or near record dryness across the country. For the lower 48, there has not been this much drought since December 2022. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by the . After one of the driest months the United States has ever seen, it should come as no surprise that the amount of drought across the contiguous United States significantly increased during October. Drought coverage increased about 20% during the month, with around 54% of the nation experiencing some level of drought at the end of the month. In addition, just over 87% of the nation is now at least abnormally dry, the largest coverage ever in the history of the U. S. Drought Monitor dating back to 2000. Although the percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing and drought) more than doubled to 6.5%, that amount is still fairly low when compared to the amount of the country currently in drought. Regionally, drought degradation was quite prevalent across most of the country with only a very few small regions seeing just a one-class improvement. The largest negative changes were on the order of 2-3 classes, mainly in the middle of the country, although there was some 2-class degradation along parts of the East Coast. Out West, drought changes were almost entirely one class, as rainfall deficits were more modest, as October is not normally a particularly wet month. U.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in November 2024. Several new areas of drought are likely to develop (yellow) across portions of the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. Existing drought in those areas, the West, and Ohio Valley are likely to continue or worsen (brown). Existing drought from Texas northward to the Great Lakes is expected to improve by at least 1 category (tan) or end (green). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See for Alaska and Hawaii. With above-average precipitation favored throughout the middle of the nation, drought improvement with some drought removal is predicted from Texas northward to the Great Lakes. However, improvement was limited only to those areas where the heaviest rainfall is forecast during early November. Broad-scale drought persistence is expected for most of the West. Improvement, at least in the Pacific Northwest, becomes more likely beyond the end of November, as indicated in the seasonal drought outlook valid through the end of January. Based on precipitation deficits dating back to September, declining soil moisture, and continued dry weather through at least the first part of November, drought persistence and development are forecast for parts of the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and in the Northeast.

        "meta_description": "With long ranges and adaptive capabilites, saildrones provide researchers with a new tool in their toolbox for collecting data in remote and hard to reach parts of the ocean.",
        "content": "In March 2009, engineer Richard Jenkins broke the world land speed record for a wind-powered vehicle by sailing a bright green sailboat on wheels across a dried lakebed in Nevada at 126 miles per hour. Now, after many engineering developments and an orange paint job, Jenkins’ design autonomously sails the sea gathering ecologic, oceanic, and atmospheric data in the . The public-private partnership between NOAA and Saildrone Inc., Jenkins’ startup company, began in 2014 when Chris Meinig of (PMEL) met Jenkins. Meinig saw the saildrone’s potential for cost-effectively enhancing NOAA’s existing ocean-monitoring fleet of buoys, ships, and autonomous vehicles. Working together with Saildrone Inc., Meinig and his PMEL and colleagues customized the saildrones by adding sensors to meet NOAA’s diverse data collecting needs. The 20-foot tall drones now carry over 200 pounds of instruments. Saildrones set sail. Photo courtesy of Saildrone Inc., via “It’s a single platform that can measure interdisciplinary aspects. You not only get the ocean physics, you also get biogeochemistry and CO , or even , and an understanding of the critters in the water,” said Meinig. These environmentally friendly saildrones—solar panels power the sensors, and wind propels the drones—can sail for months at a time and cover thousands of miles while constantly relaying data via satellite to onshore operators. Operators can also make course adjustments to further investigate any areas of interest. This adaptive capability allows saildrones to follow as they hunt for food or zig-zag across oceanic eddies or fronts—capabilities traditional monitoring methods don’t possess. “You’re able to see phenomena you couldn’t see before,” said Meinig. The saildrone recovery crew in front of three saildrones in Dutch Harbor, AK. Photo courtesy of Saildrone Inc., via . During a mission , PMEL and Fisheries researchers sent saildrones to the rough waters of the Bering Sea and the Arctic. They searched for tagged fur seals, carried out fish surveys, and studied ocean-atmosphere interactions and gas flux. Traditional Arctic monitoring is challenged by high costs and a short ice-free window of opportunity for vessels to sail north, but thanks to their renewable power supply, saildrones have more endurance and can venture farther than any vessel—with no risk to human passengers. “We get a much more integrated picture of what’s happening during the ice-free season up there relative to a ship, which gives you just a single snapshot in time,” said Jessica Cross, a NOAA PMEL oceanographer. In addition to the freedom to range wherever scientists send them, saildrones have also provided data that is so detailed that Cross and other researchers suspected the devices were malfunctioning. Once, she says, the drones observed such a large increase in carbon dioxide concentration over such a small area of ocean that they were surprised when a nearby research vessel was able to verify the signal. Between July and September of 2017 saildrones cruised past Alaska and into the Arctic, collecting observations of the difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO ) in the ocean versus the atmosphere. Positive numbers (purple) indicate that carbon dioxide pressure was higher in the ocean than the atmosphere, which favors release of carbon dioxide. Negative values mean that the carbon dioxide pressure was lower in the ocean than the atmosphere, so conditions would have favored carbon uptake. The carbon dioxide partial pressure values have been normalized with respect to temperature. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NOAA PMEL. “It’s really unprecedented,” said Cross. “Saildrones are collecting some extremely high-resolution data. And we think, that can’t be right, the ocean doesn’t work that way. And then you go back and reprocess that data and find out what you thought was a glitch was a real feature.” A few months after the Arctic mission launched, PMEL dispatched sail drones to the tropical Pacific to study how the atmosphere and ocean exchange carbon dioxide. The drones explored a region about 1,500 miles off the coast of Central America, thought to be the largest natural source of oceanic CO to the atmosphere. Saildrones’ adaptive capability could better track year-to-year changes in oceanic CO within the tropical Pacific, explained NOAA PMEL oceanographer Adrienne Sutton. The area is currently home to an observing system called the Array, a fleet of about 70 buoys moored throughout the tropical Pacific. The buoys measure changes in ocean temperature and monitor El Niño, but so far researchers have attached carbon dioxide sensors to only a few. “I think those are two things that are most exciting: Saildrones can fill in those gaps—not to mention huge gaps that exist in the southern hemisphere—and also provide adaptive sampling, so you can measure events as they are evolving. Those are two really powerful, new capabilities that we haven’t had,” said Sutton. Saildrone’s high-resolution data can also provide new ways for researchers to track El Niño in the tropical Pacific. Due to TAO’s spread-out design of stationary buoys, the warm and cold water fronts that reflect El Niño and La Niña appear broad with smeared edges. Saildrones revealed a sharper image. “We are surprised by how abrupt these fronts are,” said Meghan Cronin, an oceanographer at NOAA PMEL. “Some of these warm water fronts are so sharp that the ocean is changing a whole degree in temperature over less than a kilometer,” according to their preliminary data. There’s no way that Cronin or other researchers would see that from satellites or buoys. According to our calculations, a drone departed from Alameda, CA and sailed 8,324 miles over an 8-month period from September 2017 to April 2018. The data it collected on sea surface temperatures surprised NOAA researchers by revealing how abruptly sea surface temperatures change over short distances. NOAA Climate.gov map based on data from NOAA PMEL. Despite saildrones performing exceptionally well so far, it’s not time to dock research vessels, decommission buoys, or recall the fleet of that patrol the global ocean. Saildrones can stay out to sea for months at a time in a cost-efficient manner, but research vessels remain the most powerful tool in NOAA’s fleet because of their ability to host a diverse payload of sensors, equipment, and scientists. Buoys may be moored in one location, but they provide very detailed data as well as stable time series that are crucial for detecting change. Robotic floats, such as the , can’t accommodate CO sensors, but they can sink below the surface to measure temperature and salinity in the deep ocean. Saildrones are an exciting emerging technology, but PMEL researchers are still verifying the data they collect and brainstorming how best for NOAA to incorporate them into its ocean-monitoring fleet. “By combining all these [devices] together, you get a great picture of what’s happening at the surface with the saildrone, you get this really detailed and spatially broad snapshot with the ship, and then you get these nice long time series with the buoys. Having all three of those together enables us to paint a much more complete picture of the system than we’ve been able to before,” said Cross. Three saildrones are docked next to a larger ship and ready to launch. Photo courtesy of Saildrone Inc., via . After every mission, the team at PMEL and the drone engineers learn more about how to improve saildrones to make them more effective and durable. Because as Meinig said, “the ocean is always trying to crush what you put out there.” When the drones sailed to the tropical Pacific, Saildrone Inc. found that the small sails that handled the extreme weather of the Bering Sea didn’t provide enough power for the drones to easily navigate through the region’s low winds and strong currents. Instead, they’d need to build a separate model with a larger sail to generate more power. The buildup of algae and other organisms on the drones’ hull slowed them down, a problem they hope a new anti-biofouling coating will fix. They even had a marine hitchhiker. Once, when the drone was sailing north to the Arctic, a young spotted seal decided it looked like a nice resting place, so it hauled itself out onto the drone for two days, causing the drone to behave erratically. A young Spotted Seal hitches a ride on a sailing drone in the Arctic. Photo courtesy of Saildrone Inc., via . At this point, researchers and engineers have tweaked the drones and sampling protocols enough that saildrones are now approaching an operational stage that will allow other outside agencies, institutions, or universities to use them for their own purposes. And in regards to saildrones at NOAA’s PMEL, a new research season is about to start, with saildrones heading back to the tropical Pacific and the Arctic. “We’re going to continue to ramp up the challenge to push ourselves to do good work,” said Cross.

        "content": "Keeping track of ocean health is critical for understanding climate change, weather patterns, and the health of important fisheries. But how do NOAA and partner scientists gather data on such a vast environment? One big way is with buoys, ocean observing platforms that help scientists monitor the global ocean — including in remote, hard-to-reach areas. Some of these buoys float along the ocean surface, gathering data as they (sometimes even into the paths of hurricanes!). Some, meanwhile, are , collecting data in the same region and helping scientists observe changes over several years or decades. In honor of Ocean Month, we’re highlighting five buoys that help NOAA scientists monitor and understand the ocean (and the Great Lakes, too!). NOAA’s biophysical mooring site 2—nicknamed “ ”—is one tough buoy. Since 1995, Peggy has been taking year-round measurements of temperature, salt content, nitrate, chlorophyll and currents in the remote Bering Sea. Data collected by Peggy has been used by scientists to study the cold pool and loss of sea ice in the Bering Sea, a region that supports large marine mammal and bird populations and some of the most profitable and sustainable commercial fisheries in the United States. Many Bering Sea fish populations, including the commercially valuable Alaska pollock, thrive best when bottom waters remain cold throughout the summer. Located in the southeastern Bering Sea, NOAA's M2 moored buoy—nicknamed \"Peggy\"—records water temperatures and other physical and biological data from the surface to the floor of the coastal shelf, giving scientists an important glimpse into the status of the Bering Sea's summer cold pool. This graph shows Peggy's observations of water temperatures near the sea floor (depths of 60 meters, or 197 feet) from 2010 to mid-May 2021. In the early part of the 2010 decade, sub-zero winter temperatures and cooler summers were common. Recent years have been much warmer. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on NOAA buoy data from Shaun Bell. Background image from NOAA/NASA Suomi NPP satellite on February 27, 2021, via . Peggy is named for Peggy Dyson, who for 25 years, from her home in Kodiak, Alaska, reported the weather, family messages, and sometimes even paid bills for the mariners of the North Pacific Ocean. Peggy isn’t the only moored buoy gathering key ocean data in remote environments— from NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Lab. The ocean absorbs about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) that is released in the atmosphere, and as that CO2 is absorbed, it changes the pH of the ocean. poses a big risk to marine life — as waters become more acidic, corals have a harder time building their skeletons, oysters and other shellfish have a harder time building their shells, and fish can experience worrisome behavioral changes. A moored, autonomous buoy at Rocks, in the Florida Keys, measures pH, dissolved carbon dioxide, and other water chemistry critical to coral reef health. NOAA image. help scientists understand ocean acidification. There are currently 50 of these buoys worldwide, each of which is deployed either over a coral reef, in the open ocean, or in a coastal region. These buoys gather long-term data on carbon dioxide in the ocean, allowing scientists to track how ocean acidification is progressing in different regions. One of these buoys is deployed at a coral reef within the off of , Florida Scientists chose Rocks because of its important coral habitat, which has managed to stay relatively healthy compared to reefs farther offshore. Scientists have been studying why these inshore patch reefs like Rocks have been more resilient to environmental stressors, including coral disease, coral bleaching, and overfishing — and the MAPCO2 buoy helps in that effort. This buoy measures the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in seawater, temperature, salinity, and pH every three hours. The data is . In the Cheeca Rocks area of the Florida Keys, NOAA has deployed a buoy to keep tabs on water chemistry. Among other things, the buoy records the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the water (pCO2, light brown line) and the pH (dark brown line), which indicates the seawater's acidity. Some of the reefs at Cheeca Rocks seem more resilient to heat stress and ocean acidification than others, and NOAA hopes that detailed observations coupled with high-resolution images (such as the one in the background) will help them understand why.

These 16 gather a range of atmospheric and water data in the Great Lakes, including wave height, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, and water temperature. Data collected by buoys can help water managers keep tabs on water safety, warning of potential hypoxic (low-oxygen) events, which can affect drinking water quality. The buoys gather can help the public decide whether to hit the water for a day of boating or fishing, and the long-term data helps resource managers, educators, and researchers better understand Great Lakes health. If you’re planning a day out on the Great Lakes, you can even to get information on current wind speeds, water temperature, air temperature and more. Explore Great Lakes buoy data via the . Part of NOAA's Real-time Coastal Observation Network, this buoy in Saginaw Bay records weather and water conditions in southwestern Lake Huron. The graph shows half-hourly surface water temperatures from June 1, 2021 through midday on June 16. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on images and data NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. buoys aren't the only ones that help scientists and predict harmful algal blooms on the Great Lakes. NOAA works with the Great Lakes Observing System ( ), and , a private engineering firm, to build monitoring capacity in central Lake Erie. One buoy, for instance, on oxygen levels near a water intake in Cleveland, data that’s then incorporated into NOAA models and allows scientists to alert water managers that this low-oxygen water -- which can be dangerous -- is too close to drinking water intakes. Monsoons are seasonal shifts in wind that can cause heavy rain or droughts in regions from the tropics to the . A third of the world population depends on monsoon-driven rainfall for producing crops, so being able to understand and predict monsoons is critical to these populations — especially populations in India, which is primarily impacted by monsoons. (left) A RAMA buoy being retrieved from the Indian Ocean. (right) Monthly rainfall (top), wind (middle), and sea surface temperature (bottom) from a RAMA buoy moored at 15 degrees North, 90 degrees East, in the Indian Ocean from late 2020 through mid-2021. These simultaneous observations of the upper ocean and the atmosphere allow us to better understand how they interact to produce the weather and climate, including the arrival and departure of the wet season of the Indian Monsoon, which provides the lion's share of water for crops in India and many other countries around the Indian Ocean rim. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on from PMEL. The was designed to study the Indian Ocean’s role in monsoons and improve monsoon forecasts. RAMA is part of the , which also includes buoy arrays in the Pacific ( ) and Atlantic ( ) Oceans. RAMA is the newest array of the three, initiated in 2004 to better study the traditionally data-sparse Indian Ocean. RAMA has since grown through the formation of NOAA partnerships with Indonesia and India, and with contributions by Japan, China, and the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem program. RAMA buoys collect data on a range of atmospheric and oceanic variables, including ocean temperature, salinity, currents, wind, sea level air pressure and humidity. In 2018 India's Ministry of Earth Sciences their Ocean Moored Buoy Network for the Northern Indian Ocean would provide open access data to the new Indian Ocean RAMA-OMNI moored buoy array - meaning even more ocean data is now shared freely among researchers, helping improve the accuracy of forecasts. A DART—short for Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis—buoy floating on the ocean surface. The buoy is tethered to a pressure sensor on the ocean floor that detects passage of tsunamis. NOAA image. are critical tools in the effort to provide tsunami warnings to coastal communities. NOAA supports the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu, Hawaii—that provide forecasts and warnings of these large, dangerous waves. NOAA's DART buoy #52404 in the North Philippine Sea off Manila continuously monitors the height of the water column using a pressure sensor on the seafloor. In this graph of minute-by-minute data from May 21, 2021, the squiggles show rapid increases and decreases in the height of the water column a sign of a possible seismic event that could trigger a tsunami. Not all earthquakes and water column disturbances produce tsunamis. Data from DART buoys is sent via satellite to experts who model the disturbance's likely impact on the ocean and decide whether a tsunami warning needs to be issued. Image by NOAA Climate.gov, based on photo and data from the National Buoy Data Center. DART buoys are located strategically throughout the ocean — often close to locations where earthquakes that generate tsunamis are likely to happen - and gather key data on sea surface levels as a tsunami travels past them. After a tsunami is generated by an earthquake, a sensor located at the ocean floor communicates with the DART buoy on the surface, sending info about the magnitude of the tsunami wave directly to the Tsunami Warning Centers. The centers then create an estimate of where the tsunami was generated to produce a more accurate tsunami forecast and provide communities with the appropriate alert level (either a Watch, Advisory or Warning).

        "meta_description": "Across the United States, only Alaska has higher-than-average odds of a cool July. Elsewhere, July is favored to be much warmer than average. That heat forecast plays a big role in expectations for significant drought expansion this month.",
        "content": "For those hoping for a respite from above-normal temperatures, June was a big disappointment, as warmer-than-normal temperatures dominated large parts of the United States. In addition, significant heat waves were observed both in the West (early in the month), and then in the central and eastern parts of the country during the second half of the month. As is often seen during hot summer months, rainfall was below normal across much of the western and eastern parts of the nation, with above-average precipitation falling only in parts of the upper Midwest and southern Plains. With summer off to a very hot start, will temperatures remain above-average or will we see a break from the heat? After a fairly dry June, will drought become a significant problem across the country? Here’s the outlook for July from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC). The U.S. temperature outlook for July 2024, showing where the average temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red), near average (gray), or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean , not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average July. or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of July temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. On June 30, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for July 2024. The temperature outlook favors well above across almost the entire nation, with no tilt in odds toward any category over parts of the northern Midwest. The precipitation outlook favors well above along the Gulf Coast and the entire Atlantic Seaboard, the northern Midwest. Well below average precipitation is favored in a region extending from the Pacific Northwest southeastward to the Southern Plains. And with expectations that the hot June will continue throughout July, drought development is predicted for significant parts of the Southeast, the Ohio Valley, the Southern Plains, and in a region extending from Montana and Wyoming westward to Washington. The precipitation outlook for July 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens), near average (gray), or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean , not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average July. or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of July precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. In addition to drilling down into the specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I’ll also discuss the current state of drought and changes in drought observed during June. And my look at the upcoming month wouldn’t be complete without my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the outcome, but other outcomes are still possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found The updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC’s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), and products derived from these models. With , El Niño was not a factor in the July outlooks. Finally, observed soil moisture was considered for these outlooks, as extremes in and precipitation during the summer. The July temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across almost the entire contiguous United States. ( means “in the warmest third of all Julys in the recent climate record.”) The exception is for parts of the northern Midwest from western Michigan extending westward to eastern North and South Dakota, where odds are found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average). A large region of the nation has very high odds for the heat to continue, with probabilities exceeding 60% in large parts of the western, southern, and eastern parts of the country, and odds exceeding 70% in the Great Basin and parts of the Southwest and Intermountain West. Underpinning this monthly outlook is the fact that most of the western, southern, and eastern parts of the country are favored to have above-normal temperatures during both the short term (WPC Week-1 forecasts) and CPC longer-term (Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 outlooks). The CPC outlooks favor above-average temperatures over the entire nation. Ridging (jet stream shifted north of normal) is predicted along the West Coast early in the month, before it moves inland later in the month, becoming centered over the Northern Rockies. Ridging is also predicted to persist throughout much of the month over the East, leading to higher confidence of heat there as well. The early part of July looks to be cooler-than-average in parts of the Northern Plains and upper Great Lakes, which could persist into Week-2. Thereafter, above-average temperatures are favored, but the moderate start to the month provides enough uncertainty that there is no tilt in the odds for the month as a whole. The precipitation outlook has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-“equal chances” forecast, but the probabilities (and therefore confidence) are fairly modest, certainly much lower than the probabilities seen in the temperature outlook. Below-average precipitation is favored in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, as the previously mentioned strong ridging favored throughout most of the month should limit precipitation at the same time it’s bringing heat. The potential ridging over this region results in the largest probabilities in the precipitation outlook, exceeding 50% in the Pacific Northwest. Odds also favor below-average rainfall in parts of the southern and central Plains, where current soil moisture anomalies are below-normal, and models predict limited moisture transport into the region throughout the month. In contrast, probabilities for rainfall lean toward above average in the Upper Mississippi Valley, the southern borders of New Mexico and Arizona, and along the Gulf Coast, Florida, and along the East Coast. Expected rainfall early in the month contributes to the outlook in the Desert Southwest and in the Upper Mississippi Valley, while the slight tilt toward above-normal precipitation along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts is a nod toward and potential . After a generally hot and dry month of June, it should come as no surprise that the amount of drought increased during the month across the continuous United States, from about 12.5% at the end of May to more than 16%. What’s more concerning, however, is that the amount of the country in the DO category (abnormally dry) increased from less than 15% to almost 30%, potentially setting the stage for a large increase in drought during July. On a more positive note, the percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing and drought) remained at less than 1%, for the second consecutive month. Drought conditions across the contiguous United States as of June 25, 2024. It's good news that extreme (red) and exceptional (dark red) drought was present in only small parts of New Mexico and Texas. Less good is the very large area that was abnormally dry (yellow); it may be headed toward drought, given the July temperature and precipitation outlooks. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by the . Regionally, drought developed or worsened in much of the eastern part of the nation, with degradation of up to 3 classes observed. Some degradation was also observed in the parts of the northern Great Plains and scattered portions of the Southern Plains (both 1-2 classes). In contrast, drought improvement was seen over small regions of the Central and Southern Plains (1-2 classes) as well as in southern Florida (up to 3 classes). Drought throughout Florida during June was quite interesting, with the aforementioned improvement in the South, but development in the North. With nearly 30% of the nation abnormally dry (D0) at the end of June, and a forecast favoring above-normal temperatures across most of the nation, the drought outlook for July predicts drought development across large parts of the northwestern, south-central and eastern parts of the country. These areas all saw soil moisture conditions worsen during June, and in general these regions are not expected to receive above-normal rainfall during the month, but are all favored to experience another hot summer month. U.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in July 2024. Several large areas of new drought are likely (yellow), and of the existing drought areas, only a small part of Florida is likely to see improvement (green). Elsewhere drought is expected to persist or worsen (brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center. Current drought in these locations is also expected to persist, if not worsen. In fact, the only area currently in drought expected to see improvement (and drought removal) is in Florida and adjacent Georgia, where a favorable precipitation forecast is coincident with a favorable time of year for soil moisture recharge.

Large, violent eruptions may match the rate of human emissions for the few hours that they last, but they are too rare and fleeting to rival humanity’s annual emissions. In fact, several individual U.S. states emit more carbon dioxide in a year than all the volcanoes on the planet combined do. On the scale of carbon dioxide emissions, human sources far outweigh volcanoes. NOAA Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh. Human activities—mostly burning of coal and other fossil fuels, but also cement production, deforestation and other landscape changes—emitted roughly 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2015. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, more than 2,000 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide have been added to the atmosphere by human activities according to the Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, human emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and cement production (green line) have risen to more than 35 billion metric tons per year, while volcanoes (purple line) produce less than 1 billion metric tons annually. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on from the at the DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Burton , 2013. Volcanoes emit carbon dioxide in two ways: during eruptions and through underground magma. Carbon dioxide from underground magma is released through vents, porous rocks and soils, and water that feeds volcanic lakes and hot springs. Estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions from volcanoes have to take both erupted and non-erupted sources into account. Much of the carbon dioxide released by volcanoes is emitted by degassing of subterranean magma when the volcano is not erupting. In this photo, volcanic gases and steam rise from Mount Merapi, Indonesia, on May 20, 2012. In a 2011 peer-reviewed paper, U.S. Geologic Survey scientist Terry Gerlach summarized five previous estimates of global volcanic carbon dioxide emission rates that had been published between 1991 and 1998. Those estimates incorporated studies reaching back to the 1970s, and they were based on a wide variety of measurements, such as direct sampling and satellite remote sensing. The global estimates fell within a range of about 0.3 ± 0.15 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, implying that human carbon dioxide emissions were more than 90 times greater than global volcanic carbon dioxide emissions. On May 18, 1980, Mount Saint Helens experienced an explosive eruption, sending a column of ash, steam, and gases up to 60,000 feet above sea level. For about nine hours, carbon dioxide emissions from the volcano may have matched human emissions, but such massive eruptions are rare and fleeting. U.S. Geological Survey by Robert Krimmel. In 2013, another group of scientists—Michael Burton, Georgina Sawyer, and Domenico Granieri—published an updated estimate using more data on carbon dioxide emissions from subsurface magma that had become available in the years since the last global estimate. While acknowledging a large range of variability in the estimates, the authors concluded that the best overall estimate was about 0.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. While higher than Gerlach's estimate, the figure is still just a fraction of carbon dioxide output from human activities. Gerlach remarked via email, “Taken at face value, their result implies that anthropogenic CO exceeds global volcanic CO by at least a factor of 60 times.” Occasionally, eruptions are powerful enough to release carbon dioxide at a rate that matches or even exceeds the global rate of human emissions for a few hours. For example, Gerlach estimated that the eruptions of Mount St. Helens (1980) and Pinatubo (1991) both released carbon dioxide on a scale similar to human output for about nine hours. Human emissions of carbon dioxide continue day after day, month after month, year after year. Volcanic activity today may pale in comparison to the carbon dioxide emissions we are generating by burning fossil fuels for energy, but over the course of geologic time, volcanoes occasionally contributed to global warming by producing significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. For example, some geologists hypothesize that 250 million years ago, an extensive flood of lava poured continually from the ground in Siberia perhaps hundreds of thousands of years. This large-scale, long-lasting eruption likely raised global temperatures enough to cause one of the worst extinction events in our planet's history. Current volcanic activity doesn't occur on the same massive scale. Today, rather than warming global climate, volcanic eruptions often have the opposite effect. That's because carbon dioxide isn't the only thing that volcanoes inject into the atmosphere. Even small eruptions often produce volcanic ash and aerosol particles. Taken by astronauts from the Space Shuttle in early August 1991, this photo of the Earth's limb shows the double layer of volcanic aerosol particles (interpretation from ) that spread through the stratosphere following the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Encircling the globe at altitudes even higher than the tops of thunderstorm clouds, the particles reflected so much incoming sunlight that global surface temperatures cooled off for two years. courtesy NASA JSC's Gateway to Astronaut Photography of the Earth. Whether from small or large eruptions, volcanic aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, cooling global climate. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora produced enough ash and aerosols to cancel summer in Europe and North America in 1816. Boden, T.A., Marland, G., Andres, R.J. (2015).

The Yakima River Basin in the state of Washington supports a multibillion dollar agriculture sector. The value of apples, cherries, and other food and natural resources harvested from across the basin makes substantial contributions to the local, regional, and national economies. Additionally, the region has significant populations of salmon and steelhead trout. The fish are essential to tribal members' subsistence lifestyles and cultural traditions, and they support a thriving recreational fishing industry. Over a 15-year period in the recent past, the basin faced five years with drought conditions. The lack of water in each dry year had a strong negative impact on the region’s productivity and pointed out the risk that climate variability and change pose to the basin. Further, the Third National Climate Assessment and other studies indicate that the region can expect even more challenges as climate changes. Washington's Yakima River Basin is highlighted in white.

Recognizing their vulnerability, representatives of the Yakama Nation, irrigation districts, environmental organizations, and federal, state, county, and city governments formed a work group in 2009 to design and implement a solution to the basin’s growing water problems. By 2011, the group released a basin-wide climate adaptation strategy designed to secure a future for fish, farms, and families across the basin. The Yakima River Basin Integrated Water Resource Management Plan. Click on the image for a larger view. Image courtesy the Washington State Department of Ecology. The Yakima Basin Integrated Water Resource Management Plan is a 30-year, $3.8 billion plan that restores ecological integrity to the region and provides assurances for meeting agricultural water needs even in the face of ongoing climate change. The plan is a collaborative effort to restore and protect ecosystems: it strategically and creatively addresses the realities of climate uncertainty and places the basin on a path to long-term resiliency. The plan lays out a set of key elements to help protect, mitigate, and enhance fish and wildlife habitat and improve the reliability of the region’s water supply. The elements include provision of fish passage at several points, enhanced water conservation efforts, habitat and watershed protection and enhancement, and structural and operational changes in storing and using surface water and groundwater. Implementation of the plan has been scheduled in three phases. The first phase, expected to be complete by 2025, has already begun with the purchase of 70,000 acres of forested lands. The lands will be managed for restoration and watershed conservation. The first phase also includes water conservation efforts, installation of fish passages, construction of a conveyance pipeline and a drought-relief pumping plant, and $100 million of river and stream restoration projects to benefit fish species. Proponents of the plan are currently seeking federal authority to fully implement its initial phase. They are also working to secure the designation of Wild and Scenic River for the upper Cle Elum River system, a section of the river basin that will facilitate restored salmon and steelhead runs after fish passage is installed at Cle Elum Dam. The Cle Elum River, a tributary to the Yakima River, will be home to a large salmon run after installation of fish passages at Cle Elum Dam. Image credit: Michael Garrity, American Rivers. Used with permission. The state of Washington and the federal government have both made investments that bring the Integrated Plan closer to reality. When the plan is fully implemented around 2040, the work group anticipates that the region will have a stable water supply that supports healthy populations of salmon and steelhead. The work group also anticipates that the basin will be able to meet the water needs of agriculture concerns, delivering at least 70 percent of allotted amounts even during drought conditions. The Integrated Plan facilitates long-term collaboration among many organizations, ultimately promoting ecological health and climate resilience in this productive river basin. Complementing the Integrated Plan, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation have also developed a to align all governmental departments and programs, identify important resources and cultural components that may be particularly affected by projected climate change, and develop specific recommendations for deeper analysis and priority adaptive actions to take now. As Yakama tribal elder Shxmyak says in the Plan's Dedication to our Children, \"we must begin preparations to maintain our community and our natural resources. We must carry forward our culture and traditions for our tribes' future and for your own families' well-being.\" This story was adapted from the National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy. “ .” Help us improve our content"

Some plants and trees can't tolerate sub-freezing temperatures, for example, while some require a chilling period of a minimum length in order to break winter dormancy and flower. If you’re planting a garden this Earth Day, this set of maps can help you see how planting zones where you live may have shifted over the past few decades in response to warming climate. This interactive map shows the average annual coldest winter temperatures across the contiguous United States for 1981-2010 divided into 10-degree \"planting zone\" bins. If you zoom to a particular place on the map and click to show the pop-up, you can see your current planting zone as well as what your planting zone would have been during the 1971-2000 period. If you of the map, you can tab between three map layers: the planting zones as of 1981-2010 (the most recent U.S. Climate Normals), planting zones during 1971-2000 (the previous Normals period), and places where a given planting zone has shifted northward or upward in elevation between the two time periods. These shifts are due to long-term warming of winter minimum temperatures. In those areas, warmer nights are allowing plant species to shift their range northward or upward in elevation. Updated each decade, the from NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information are 30-year averages of many pieces of weather information collected from thousands of weather stations nationwide. Each time they are updated, an old decade is dropped, and a new one is added. The last update was in July 2011: the decade 1971-1980 was dropped, 2001-2010 was added, and the new 30-year window for the U.S. Climate Normals became 1981-2010. Since the '70s was an unusually cool decade, while 2001-2010 was the warmest ever recorded, it is not surprising that the average temperature rose for most locations. For the United States as a whole, though, it was not daytime highs (maximum temperatures) but overnight lows (minimum temperatures) that rose the most compared with the 1970s. Climate normals can help people understand what conditions they can expect wherever they may live… and plant. A previous on Climate.gov explored the implications of the new climate normals for gardeners and landscapers. Not only can plants can generally survive farther north than they used to, but the fire season is longer and pests are able to thrive and spread in forests and other natural landscapes. Pollination patterns may also be changing. The confirms that landscapes across the country are changing rapidly. The report predicts that “species, including many iconic species, may disappear from regions where they have been prevalent or become extinct, altering some regions so much that their mix of plant and animal life will become almost unrecognizable. These maps of climate-related planting zones were created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 2011 as a special service to the American Public Garden Association. (In 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also updated their official , the standard by which gardeners and growers can determine which plants are most likely to thrive at a location.) Based on the average of the coldest daily temperature at a location each year during the respective 30-year periods, the maps illustrate one way in which climate change in recent decades can influence Americans' day to day lives. .

        "content": "Yes. While we cannot stop global warming overnight, we can slow the rate and limit the amount of global warming by reducing human emissions of heat-trapping gases and soot (“black carbon”). If all human emissions of heat-trapping gases were to stop today, Earth’s temperature would continue to rise for a few decades as ocean currents bring excess heat stored in the deep ocean back to the surface. Once this excess heat radiated out to space, Earth’s temperature would stabilize. Experts think the additional warming from this “hidden” heat are unlikely to exceed 0.9° Fahrenheit (0.5°Celsius). With no further human influence, natural processes would begin to slowly remove the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and global temperatures would gradually begin to decline. Change in heat content in the upper 2,300 feet (700 meters) of the ocean from 1993-2020. Between 1993–2019, heat content rose by up to 6 Watts per square meter in parts of the ocean (dark orange). Some areas lost heat (blue), but overall, the ocean gained more heat than it lost. The changes in areas covered with the gray shading were not statistically significant. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NCEI. It’s true that without dramatic action in the next couple of decades, we are unlikely to keep global warming in this century below 2.7° Fahrenheit (1.5° Celsius) compared to pre-industrial temperatures—a threshold that experts say offers a lower risk of serious negative impacts. But the more we overshoot that threshold, the more serious and widespread the negative impacts will be, which means that it is never “too late” to take action. In response to a request from the U.S. Congress, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences published a series of peer-reviewed reports, titled , to provide authoritative analyses to inform and guide responses to climate change across the nation. Relevant to this question, the NAS report titled explains policies that could be adopted to slow or even reverse global warming. The report says, \"Meeting internationally discussed targets for limiting atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and associated increases in global average temperatures will require a major departure from business as usual in how the world uses and produces energy.\" Transitioning to energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases, such as solar, wind, biofuels, and nuclear, can slow the pace of climate change, though these energy sources face hurdles ranging from manufacturing capacity to debates about where to install some facilities. Images courtesy Energy.gov. Alternative methods to slow or reduce global warming have been proposed that are, collectively, known as \"climate engineering\" or \"geoengineering.\" Some geoengineering proposals involve cooling Earth's surface by injecting reflective particles into the upper atmosphere to scatter and reflect sunlight back to space. Other proposals involve seeding the oceans with iron to stimulate large-scale phytoplankton blooms, thereby drawing down carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Such methods could work, in principle, but many climate scientists oppose undertaking geoengineering until we have a much better understanding of the possible side effects. Additionally, there are unresolved legal and ethical issues surrounding geoengineering. Given these concerns, the (readopted in January 2013) in which it said: \"...research to date has not determined whether there are large-scale geoengineering approaches that would produce significant benefits, or whether those benefits would substantially outweigh the detriments. Indeed, geoengineering must be viewed with caution because manipulating the Earth system has considerable potential to trigger adverse and unpredictable consequences.\" Martinich, J., B.J.

        "meta_description": "NOAA's network of moored buoys in the tropical Pacific is getting an upgrade that will help scientists better understand and predict El Niño and La Nina.",
        "content": "Now through 2027, one of the most famous observational arrays in the ocean-monitoring world is getting a make-over by the with additional capabilities, updated instruments, more strategic placement, and higher-frequency observations. This next evolution of the Pacific TAO array— is short for “Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean”—marks the first time the network in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean has seen such a substantial upgrade since the original array was completed in 1994. The new capabilities will give scientists an unparalleled look at the complex ocean-atmospheric interactions across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, namely the climate patterns, which affect global climate every few years. To understand how the planned upgrade, which scientists and engineers refer to as the “TAO Recap,” is shaking things up, you need to know what is currently out there. Let’s start with the basics: the TAO buoy array is a set of 55 moored buoys that are anchored to the seafloor in a series of parallel north-to-south lines from the western Pacific (165°E) to the eastern Pacific (95°W). The new locations of the moored buoys in the Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean array. The new fixed locations were chosen to complement data from other types of sensors, such as drifters and Argo sub-surface floats. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the National Data Buoy Center. Above the ocean, these buoys measure conditions like wind speed and direction, relative humidity, and air temperature. In the water, they measure ocean temperatures at the sea surface and 10 other depths in the upper 500 meters. At four specific moorings, they also measure horizontal and/or vertical currents, as well as radiation from the sun and earth, rain, and barometric pressure. Since their installation starting in 1985 and ending 1994, the TAO array has provided scientists with a remarkable amount of data documenting the variability of the ocean and atmosphere across the Pacific. These data have been fundamental to advancing our knowledge of how El Niño and La Niña start and end, and also vital to improving our ability to accurately simulate and predict them in climate models. In fact, that was part of the reason for the array’s existence to begin with: the strong El Niño of 1982-83 caught scientists and the world by surprise, in large part due to a lack of observations across the Pacific Ocean. TAO Recap is the result of a multi-year project, started in 2014, to modernize the array and gather more detailed data on some still less frequently monitored conditions and locations across the Pacific Ocean. This effort was spurred in part after the NOAA Ship Ka’Imimoana, commissioned specifically to service the buoys, was de-commissioned in 2012. Loading buoy equipment and personnel on the while at the port of San Diego, California, prior to a 2022 research cruise through the Pacific Ocean that deployed a prototype of the new TAO buoy for testing. NOAA photo. The upgraded array will remove some buoy locations from the previous TAO array (12 buoys in total), while also putting additional buoys (five in total) in some locations to get a better view of ocean movement and the northern Intertropical Convergence Zone—where the northeast and southeast trade winds converge during the northern hemisphere summer. Better wind and rain observations in the Intertropical Convergence Zone will have multiple payoffs, including ground-truth for satellite-based wind estimates in areas with heavy rain and more real-time data in parts of the ocean where many tropical cyclones are born. And that’s the big point of this project. Scientists have used the multi-decade observational records and knowledge obtained from TAO to pinpoint what the scientific community needs to know in which locations to better understand and predict the ocean and climate. All so that the public can receive better forecasts. One of those needs and desires was a better understanding of the ocean’s —a striking feature of the open ocean where salinity, temperature and density are almost vertically uniform. The surface mixed layer across the equatorial Pacific Ocean plays a critical role in El Niño and La Niña as of the ocean basin. The new basic TAO Recap buoy will have five to seven additional measurements of the mixed layer from 10 m to 60 m. This represents a large increase from the existing network which measures the mixed layer at three levels beneath the surface. A more detailed look at the mixed layer will not only help scientists better understand how it changes during El Niño and La Niña events, but also help models better simulate these events. All of which, hopefully, will lead to better predictions and preparedness. Buoys in the Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean (TAO) Array in the equatorial Pacific are anchored to the bottom of the ocean in a series of parallel lines of longitude. (Drawing is not to scale). The buoys along a given longitude are spaced more than 100 miles apart. The new versions of the TAO buoys have temperature sensors at more depths than previous ones, giving a more detailed picture of the upper ocean heat content. NOAA Climate.gov drawing. Another need addressed by TAO Recapitalized buoy will be the inclusion of barometric pressure, rain, and solar radiation measurements across the array. Even better, these observations will all be transmitted in ten-minute increments. Currently, observations are only transmitted hourly. But wait, there’s more! The TAO Recapitalized array will also include a subset of buoys capable of observing real-time ocean current data not only at the surface but at depth, meaning an entire current profile from 11 to 315 meters. In particular, there will be a band of these enhanced buoys along a north-south line from 2°N-2°S at 140°W that will monitor the equatorial undercurrent when it is shallow. The equatorial undercurrent is an ocean current that runs eastward across the length of the tropical Pacific Ocean at depths of 50 to 200 meters. The current plays a vital role in El Niño and La Niña events by moving heat eastward across the Pacific Ocean. As you can imagine, many scientists are waiting with bated breath for the better equipped and more strategically placed array to be deployed and the data to arrive. But we don’t have to wait until the whole network is deployed to understand the benefits of the new instruments. As part of a , scientists added new instruments and capabilities to a handful of existing TAO buoys. The data the instruments recorded highlighted to scientists the need for more and improved observations in the mixed layer to help climate models better simulate and scientists better understand the complexities of the Pacific Ocean. One such example is a comparison of two ocean temperature profiles from the surface to 75 meters at a buoy located at 2°S 165°E–one profile created using observations at current depth levels, and the other at the additional levels once TAO Recapitalized buoys are deployed. Having data from additional depths uncovered some episodes when heat from the surface penetrated deeper into the water column than the older buoy was able to capture (60 meters compared to 50 meters). At other times, the new buoys showed that pulses of heating at the surface remained quite shallow, mixing down no more than 5 meters, whereas the old buoy implied that heat had mixed down as deep as 20 meters. Each column in these images is one day of temperature data in the upper 80 meters of the tropical Pacific Ocean recorded by a buoy at 2˚ South, 165˚ East. Newer buoy sensors show that at times, such as the second half of July, heat penetrated the water column more deeply than old buoy sensors implied. At other times, such as mid-August, heat stayed closer to the surface than measurements from older buoys suggested. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from Karen Grissom. Large images: | . This improved observation of just where and when heat does and doesn’t reach deeper parts of the ocean could have profound impacts on modeling and seasonal predictions of climate phenomena like the El Niño Southern Oscillation. How? At its core, El Niño is a transfer of heat and energy between the western and eastern Pacific Ocean through subsurface waves of warm water. A better picture of when surface heat has or hasn’t penetrated deeper waters can lead to better predictions of when and where that heat moves. The next TAO Recapitalized buoy deployment mission is ongoing right now as the eastern portion of the array is serviced. By the end of this fiscal year, there will be five prototype buoys deployed across the Pacific, with one of them providing publicly available data. The rest will be monitored by engineers and scientists and cross-checked with existing data to make sure they are operating as expected. The big jump in deployment comes in the next few years as 15 new buoys are deployed in fiscal year 2025 and 2026, with the remainder deployed in 2027. This process represents just another chapter in the storied history of the TAO array. From its origins in the 1970s as NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory’s , to the expansion in the 1980s and 1990s under the , to the addition of more buoys in the western Pacific by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology which resulted in the renaming of the array to . The new TAO array, also known asTAO Recap, is expected to provide data that will significantly improve our understanding of the Pacific Ocean, improving climate predictions for millions across the globe. The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) is part of NOAA’s National Weather Service and is charged with collecting and disseminating marine observations, while also designing and maintaining our ocean observing network. The TAO Recap array is just one type of array that NDBC operates and maintains. Others include the DART array, or “Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis” array which helps to detect tsunamis as well as the Coastal Weather Buoy network, a suite of near-shore and deep-ocean moored buoys which monitor weather and ocean conditions vital for weather forecasting. Simply put, if a buoy is in the ocean making observations, it’s likely the National Data Buoy Center had a hand. . NDBC Facebook: NDBC Twitter: Help us improve our content"

        "content": "Our 4.54-billion-year-old planet probably experienced its hottest temperatures in its earliest days, when it was still colliding with other rocky debris ( ) careening around the solar system. The heat of these collisions would have kept Earth molten, with top-of-the-atmosphere temperatures upward of 3,600° Fahrenheit. Even after those first scorching millennia, however, the planet has often been much warmer than it is now. One of the warmest times was during the geologic period known as the Neoproterozoic, between 600 and 800 million years ago. Conditions were also frequently sweltering between 500 million and 250 million years ago. And within the last 100 million years, two major heat spikes occurred: the Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse (about 92 million years ago), and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (about 56 million years ago). Cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh, NOAA Climate.gov. Temperature records from thermometers and weather stations exist only for a tiny portion of our planet's 4.54-billion-year-long life. By studying indirect clues—the chemical and structural signatures of rocks, fossils, and crystals, ocean sediments, fossilized reefs, tree rings, and ice cores—however, scientists can infer past temperatures. None of these techniques help with the early Earth. During the time known as the Hadean (yes, because it was like Hades), Earth’s collisions with other large planetesimals in our young solar system—including a Mars-sized one whose impact with Earth likely created the Moon—would have melted and vaporized most rock at the surface. Because no rocks on Earth have survived from so long ago, scientists have estimated early Earth conditions based on observations of the Moon and on astronomical models. Following the collision that spawned the Moon, the planet was estimated to have been around 2,300 Kelvin (3,680°F). What the collision that spawned Earth's Moon may have looked like. Collisions between Earth and rocky debris in the early solar system would have kept the surface molten and surface temperatures blistering. Image courtesy . Even after collisions stopped, and the planet had tens of millions of years to cool, surface temperatures were likely more than 400° Fahrenheit. from Australia, only about 150 million years younger than the Earth itself, hint that our planet may have cooled faster than scientists previously thought. Still, in its infancy, Earth would have experienced temperatures far higher than we humans could possibly survive. But suppose we exclude the violent and scorching years when Earth first formed. When else has Earth’s surface sweltered? Between 600 and 800 million years ago—a period of time geologists call the Neoproterozoic—evidence suggests the Earth underwent an so cold that ice sheets not only capped the polar latitudes, but may have extended all the way to sea level near the equator. Reflecting ever more sunlight back into space as they expanded, the ice sheets cooled the climate and reinforced their own growth. Obviously, the Earth didn’t remain stuck in the freezer, so how did the planet thaw?

Even while ice sheets covered more and more of Earth’s surface, tectonic plates continued to drift and collide, so volcanic activity also continued. Volcanoes emit the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. In our current, mostly ice-free world, the natural weathering of silicate rock by rainfall consumes carbon dioxide over geologic time scales. During the frigid conditions of the Neoproterozoic, rainfall became rare. With volcanoes churning out carbon dioxide and little or no rainfall to weather rocks and consume the greenhouse gas, temperatures climbed. What evidence do scientists have that all this actually happened some 700 million years ago? Some of the best evidence is \" \" lying directly over Neoproterozoic-age glacial deposits. Cap carbonates—layers of calcium-rich rock such as limestone—only form in warm water. Rock formation in Namibia that shows a type of rock that only forms in warm water (cap dolostone) lying directly over a type of jumbled sedimentary rock, dated to 635 million years ago, that is commonly found at the margin of glaciers (diamictite). Image from available at SnowballEarth.org. The fact that these thick, calcium-rich rock layers sat directly on top of rock deposits left behind by retreating glaciers indicate that temperatures rose significantly near the end of the Neoproterozoic, perhaps reaching a global average higher than 90° Fahrenheit. (Today's global average is lower than 60°F.) A Smithsonian Institution project has tried to reconstruct temperatures for the Phanerozoic Eon, or roughly the last half a billion years. released in 2019 showed warm temperatures dominating most of that time, with global temperatures repeatedly rising above 80°F and even 90°F—much too warm for ice sheets or perennial sea ice. About 250 million years ago, around the equator of the supercontinent Pangea, it was even too hot for peat swamps! Preliminary results from a Smithsonian Institution project led by Scott Wing and Brian Huber, showing Earth's average surface temperature over the past 500 million years. For most of the time, global temperatures appear to have been too warm (red portions of line) for persistent polar ice caps. The most recent 50 million years are an exception. Image adapted from Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Geologists and paleontologists have found that, in the last 100 million years, global temperatures have peaked twice. One spike was the Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse roughly 92 million years ago, about 25 million years before Earth’s last dinosaurs went extinct. Widespread volcanic activity may have boosted atmospheric carbon dioxide. Temperatures were so high that champsosaurs (crocodile-like reptiles) lived as far north as the Canadian Arctic, and warm-temperature forests thrived near the South Pole. Another hothouse period was the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) about 55-56 million years ago. Though not quite as hot as the Cretaceous hothouse, the PETM brought . During much of the Paleocene and early Eocene, the poles were free of ice caps, and palm trees and crocodiles lived above the Arctic Circle. Around the time of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, much of the continental United States had a sub-tropical environment. This fossil palm is from Fossil Butte National Monument, Wyoming. Image courtesy U.S. During the PETM, the global mean temperature appears to have risen by as much as 5-8°C (9-14°F) to an average temperature as high as 73°F. (Again, today’s global average is shy of 60°F.) At roughly the same time, paleoclimate data like fossilized phytoplankton and ocean sediments record a massive release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, at least doubling or possibly even quadrupling the background concentrations. Global surface temperatures were generally high throughout the Paleocene and Eocene, with a particularly warm spike at the boundary between the two geological epochs around 56 million years ago. Temperatures in the distant past are inferred from proxies, in this case, oxygen isotope ratios from fossil foraminifera, single-celled marine organisms. \"Q\" stands for Quaternary.

It is still uncertain where all the carbon dioxide came from and what the exact sequence of events was. Scientists have considered the drying up of large inland seas, volcanic activity, thawing permafrost, release of methane from warming ocean sediments, huge wildfires, and even—briefly—a comet. Earth’s hottest periods—the Hadean, the late Neoproterozoic, the Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse, the PETM—occurred before humans existed. Those ancient climates would have been like nothing our species has ever seen. Modern human civilization, with its permanent agriculture and settlements, has developed over just the past 10,000 years or so. The period has generally been one of low temperatures and relative global ( ) climate stability. Compared to most of Earth’s history, today is unusually cold; we now live in what geologists call an interglacial—a period between glaciations of an ice age. But as greenhouse-gas emissions warm Earth’s climate, it's possible our planet has seen its last glaciation for a long time. British Geological Survey. . Accessed February 7, 2022. Engber, D.

Weather describes atmospheric conditions at a particular time and place. Climate is the overall statistical characteristics of weather and environmental conditions, such as long-term averages and ranges of variability, for a given place and season.",
        "content": "In many ways, it is actually harder to forecast weather 2 weeks in advance than it is to forecast climate decades in advance because weather is about the conditions and climate is about conditions. Climate models are not trying, for example, to forecast the daytime high temperature in Chicago, IL, on August 15, 2035. They are trying to forecast the daytime high temperature for the of August over the entire of the 2030s. And while the exact weather conditions at a given location can change dramatically from hour to hour, the average changes much less from year to year or even decade to decade. The difference in time scale means that our ability to predict future climate doesn’t depend on our ability to predict next week’s weather. It's a reasonably safe bet that flowering trees will flower on the National Mall in the springtime, and bear fruit in the autumn. Photo CC license by . Not only are weather models predicting different things than climate models, they require different kinds of starting information. Modelers call weather forecasting an problem because, at short time scales, the future atmospheric conditions depend mostly on the initial atmospheric conditions. The accuracy of your forecast for a given location depends heavily on how well you can describe these initial conditions, especially in the surrounding area. In contrast, most modelers describe a climate projection as a problem because at long time scales (years to decades), future climate depends mostly on big-picture characteristics of the Earth system that don’t vary from day to day: the amount of land and ocean surface, the height and location of mountain ranges, the geometry of Earth’s orbit, and—crucially—the composition of the global atmosphere. These things define the boundaries of the climate system, the relatively narrow range of outcomes that are possible over long time frames. These fundamental differences between weather models and climate models, in both what they are trying to predict and what those predictions depend on, mean that the quality of a weather forecast two weeks out isn’t a good test of how well we can predict the climate two decades out.

The values are shown as change in sea level in millimeters compared to the 1993-2008 average. NOAA Climate.gov image based on analysis and data from Philip Thompson, . Global mean sea level has risen about 8–9 inches (21–24 centimeters) since 1880. The rising water level is mostly due to a combination of melt water from glaciers and ice sheets and thermal expansion of seawater as it warms. In 2023, global mean sea level was 101.4 millimeters (3.99 inches) above 1993 levels, making it the highest annual average in the satellite record (1993-present). In some ocean basins, sea level has risen as much as 6-8 inches (15-20 centimeters) since the start of the satellite record. Regional differences exist because of natural variability in the strength of winds and ocean currents, which influence how much and where the deeper layers of the ocean store heat. The global mean water level in the ocean rose by 0.14 inches (3.6 millimeters) per year from 2006–2015, which was 2.5 times the average rate of 0.06 inches (1.4 millimeters) per year throughout most of the twentieth century. By the end of the century, global mean sea level is likely to rise at least one foot (0.3 meters) above 2000 levels, even if greenhouse gas emissions follow a relatively low pathway in coming decades. Between 1993 and 2023 mean sea level has risen across most of the world ocean (blue colors). In some ocean basins, sea level has risen 6-8 inches (15-20 centimeters). Rates of sea level (dots) on the coast can be larger than the global average due to geological processes like ground settling or smaller than the global average due to processes like the centuries-long rebound of land masses from the loss of ice-age glaciers. Map by NOAA Climate.gov based on data provided by Philip Thompson, . Past and future sea level rise on land may be more or less than the global average due to local factors: ground settling, upstream flood control, erosion, regional ocean currents, and whether the land is still rebounding or resettling from the compressive weight of vanished Ice Age glaciers. In the United States, the fastest rates of sea level rise are occurring in the Gulf of Mexico from the mouth of the Mississippi westward, followed by the mid-Atlantic. Only in Alaska and a few places in the Pacific Northwest are sea levels falling today, although that trend will reverse in the future if the world follows a pathway with high greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, of the population lives in coastal areas, where sea level rise plays a role in flooding, shoreline erosion, and hazards from storms. Globally, 8 of the world’s 10 largest cities are near a coast, according to the U.N. Atlas of the Oceans. South Beach, Miami on May 3, 2007. Photo by Flickr user , via a Creative Commons license. In urban settings along coastlines around the world, rising seas threaten infrastructure necessary for local jobs and regional industries. Roads, bridges, subways, water supplies, oil and gas wells, power plants, sewage treatment plants, landfills—the list is practically endless—are all at risk from sea level rise. Higher background water levels mean that deadly and destructive storm surges, such as those associated with Hurricane Katrina, “Superstorm” Sandy, and Hurricane Michael, push farther inland than they once did. Higher sea level also means more frequent high-tide flooding, sometimes called “ ” because it isn't generally deadly or dangerous, but it can be disruptive and expensive.

In the natural world, rising sea level on coastal ecosystems that provide recreation, protection from storms, and habitat for fish and wildlife, including commercially valuable fisheries. As seas rise, saltwater is also , many of which sustain municipal and agricultural water supplies and natural ecosystems. Global warming is causing global mean sea level to rise in two ways. First, glaciers and ice sheets worldwide and adding water to the ocean. Second, the volume of the ocean is expanding as the water warms. A third, much smaller contributor to sea level rise is a decline in the amount of liquid water on land—aquifers, lakes and reservoirs, rivers, soil moisture. This shift of liquid water from land to ocean is largely due to people depleting ground water. From the 1970s up through the last decade or so, melting and heat expansion were contributing roughly equally to observed sea level rise. But the melting of and ice sheets has accelerated: As a result, the amount of sea level rise due to melting (with a small addition from groundwater transfer and other water storage shifts) from 2005–2013 was nearly twice the amount of sea level rise due to thermal expansion. Melt streams on the Greenland Ice Sheet on July 19, 2015. Ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets as well as alpine glaciers has accelerated in recent decades. by Maria-José Viñas. Sea level is measured by two main methods: and . Tide gauge stations from around the world have measured the daily high and low tides for more than a century, using a variety of manual and automatic sensors. Using data from scores of stations around the world, scientists can calculate a global average and adjust it for seasonal differences. Since the early 1990s, sea level has been measured from space using radar altimeters, which determine the height of the sea surface by measuring the return speed and intensity of a radar pulse directed at the ocean. The higher the sea level, the faster and stronger the return signal is. Observed sea level since the start of the satellite altimeter record in 1993 (black line), plus independent estimates of the different contributions to sea level rise: thermal expansion (red) and added water, mostly due to glacier melt (blue). Added together (purple line), these separate estimates match the observed sea level very well. NOAA Climate.gov graphic, adapted from Figure 3.15a in . To estimate how much of the observed sea level rise is due to thermal expansion, scientists measure sea surface temperature using moored and , satellites, and water samples collected by ships. Temperatures in the upper half of the ocean are measured by a global fleet of . Deeper temperatures are measured by instruments lowered from oceanographic research ships. To estimate how much of the increase in sea level is due to actual mass transfer—the movement of water from land to ocean—scientists rely on a combination of direct measurements of melt rate and glacier elevation made during field surveys, and of tiny shifts in Earth’s gravity field. When water shifts from land to ocean, the increase in mass increases the strength of gravity over oceans by a small amount. From these gravity shifts, scientists estimate the amount of added water. As global temperatures continue to warm, additional sea level rise is inevitable. How much and by when depends mostly on the future rate of greenhouse gas emissions. But another source of uncertainty is whether big ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland will melt in a steady, predictable way as the Earth gets warmer, or whether they will reach a tipping point and rapidly collapse. Every four or five years, NOAA leads an interagency task force that reviews the latest research on sea level rise and issues a report on likely— and ‘unlikely but plausible’—amounts future sea level rise for different greenhouse gas and global warming pathways. In the 2022 report, the task force concluded that even on the pathway with the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions and warming (1.5 degrees C), global mean sea level would rise at least 0.3 meters (1 foot) above 2000 levels by 2100. On a pathway with very high rates of emissions that trigger rapid ice sheet collapse, sea level could be as much as 2 meters (6.6 feet) higher in 2100 than it was in 2000. Observed sea level from 2000-2018, with future sea level through 2100 for six future pathways (colored lines) The pathways differ based on future rates of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming and differences in the plausible rates of glacier and ice sheet loss. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from Sweet et al., 2022. One piece of good news: the task force concluded that an extreme possibility (8.2 feet above 2000 levels by 2100) that they couldn’t rule out at the time of their 2017 report appears to be less likely based on the latest science. This doesn’t mean global sea level rise of that much won’t happen, only that it is extremely unlikely to happen by 2100. Still, on a pathway with high greenhouse gas emissions, if processes triggering rapid ice sheet collapse kick in, global sea level could rise upwards of 3.7 meters (12 feet) higher in 2150 than it was in 2000. Now the bad news: the report reaffirmed that many parts of the United States can expect their local rate and overall amount of sea level rise to exceed the global average. Extrapolating from observed rates, sea levels on average along the contiguous U.S. are expected to rise as much over the next 30 years (10-12 inches over 2020-2050) as they have over the last 100 years (1920-2020). In some regions, the increases will be even larger. In the western Gulf of Mexico, for example, sea level rise is likely to be about 16-18 inches higher than 2020 levels by 2050—almost a ½ foot higher than the national average. Projections for U.S. sea level rise for the end of the century and beyond depend on which greenhouse gas pathway we follow and how the major ice sheets respond to this ocean and atmospheric warming. If we are able to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, U.S. sea level in 2100 is projected to be around 0.6 meters (2 feet) higher on average than it was in 2000. But on a pathway with high greenhouse gas emissions and rapid ice sheet collapse, models project that average sea level rise for the contiguous United States could be 2.2 meters (7.2 feet) by 2100 and 3.9 meters (13 feet) by 2150. These are for education and communication purposes only. The early part of the time series shown in the graph above comes from the of CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), Australia's national science agency. They are documented in Church and White (2011). The more recent part of the time series is from the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center ( ). It is based on a weighted average of 373 global tide gauge records collected by the U.S. National Ocean Service, UHSLC, and partner agencies worldwide. The weights for each gauge in the global mean are determined by a cluster analysis that groups gauges from locations where sea level tends to vary in the same way. This prevents over-emphasizing regions where there are many tide gauges located in close proximity. The most recent year of data should be considered preliminary. Scientific users should acquire research-quality data directly from UHSLC and/or the NOAA webpage.

The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA ), with periodic guest contributors. Ideas and explanations found in these posts should be attributed to the ENSO blog team, and not to NOAA (the agency) itself. These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. . The famous Beach Boys lyric “ ” has a lot more to do with atmospheric science than one may realize. Our latest research has found that two atmospheric wave patterns forced from tropical systems, ENSO and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, work together to affect rainfall patterns in the United States, sometimes leading to extreme flooding or drought events ( ). Luckily, climate forecasters can analyze these large-scale waves to make predictions weeks and months in advance. Particularly important to U.S. weather and climate are atmospheric waves that start in the tropics and travel to the midlatitudes. One major source of these waves is the (MJO). The MJO sounds fancy and, let’s be honest, boring, but it’s not! The MJO is a system of very tall or deep convective clouds (storminess) that travels eastward along the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans approximately every 30-60 days. The convective region of the MJO has enhanced storms and rainfall, and it is usually sandwiched to the east and west by dry, sunny areas. Averages of all January–March MJO events from 1979–2016. Green shading shows below-average OLR (outgoing longwave radiation, or heat energy) values, indicating more clouds and rainfall, and brown shading identifies above-average OLR (drier and clearer skies than normal). The purple contours show the location and strength of the Pacific jet at the 200-hPa level (roughly 38,000 feet at that location). Note the eastward movement of the wet and dry areas. How far the Pacific jet extends past the international dateline also changes with the phase of the MJO. NOAA Climate.gov animation, adapted from original images provided by Carl Schreck. These convective storms form from surface convergence of winds, which then rise and diverge at the top of the . The convection disrupts the air at the top of the atmosphere, which results in long, planetary scale (~5,000 miles) waves that travel away from their tropical source into the midlatitudes near the top of the troposphere, like waves that ripple away on top of a lake from skipping stones. (1) These large-scale waves, known as , are due to the rotation of the Earth and characterized by north-south undulations around high and low pressure systems. Like most waves, these waves carry signals: radio waves carry classic rock to your car, microwaves carry microwave radiation to heat your frozen dinner, and atmospheric waves carry temperature, pressure, and wind signals that can alter the weather. The atmospheric waves produced by the MJO can have different effects on the mid-latitudes depending on where the MJO convection (storminess) is on its journey from the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific (2). Our study analyzed the influence of the MJO during the Northern Hemisphere winter months, November-April, as this is when the MJO is typically strongest. We specifically focus on U.S. rainfall impacts since both drought and flooding events have vast societal, economic, and environmental impacts. While most prior studies investigated influences from the MJO on the West Coast, we focused on a strong relationship we discovered in the Southeast U.S. When the MJO starts out in the Indian Ocean and makes its way across Indonesia, the ripples it causes in the upper atmosphere often lead to a change in U.S. pressure patterns. Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is pushed over the Southeastern states, leading to rainfall. As the MJO makes its way into the central Pacific, the opposite pressure patterns head cool, dry air from the north to cause dryness in the Southeast U.S. Another defining characteristic of the MJO is the dryness on both the east and west sides of the enhanced rainfall on the equator. These dry regions also create waves because of the sinking motion at the top of the atmosphere. An exciting area of research that others in our field are working on is how the waves from the rainy and dry regions of the MJO interact and influence North American weather patterns as the MJO is travelling around the globe ( , ). The S.S. ENSO cruise ship and MJO speedboat making their way across the \"harbor\" of the tropical Pacific Ocean. The cruise ship represents the stationary ENSO pattern creating steady, rolling waves. The speedboat represents the rapidly moving MJO travelling through the waves created by the S.S. ENSO, altering the wake that the MJO speedboat is producing. The floating person represents the United States that feels the impact from the both the cruise ship's wake and the speedboat's modified wake. Note that refers to just a specific region in the U.S. that changes with time. The impacts from the MJO and ENSO wave interference can vary both in space and time. Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh. Things get really choppy when we add ENSO to the mix. ENSO is a stationary pattern in the tropics, but the MJO is a traveling pattern roughly following the equator. In fact, ENSO is controlling the background through which the MJO is moving. Specific MJO events can vary depending on the state of ENSO. The strength of the MJO convection, how fast it moves eastward, and how far it travels all change based on ENSO conditions. These ENSO-modified MJO events then lead to varied impacts on U.S. rainfall. Imagine a massive cruise ship very slowly making its way back and forth through a harbor. As it moves, it creates steady, rolling waves. The MJO is then a speedboat, passing through the wake of the cruise ship. There are now two boats forcing waves in the same water. ENSO (cruise ship) modifies the MJO (speedboat) by altering the environment that the MJO is moving through. Since the speedboat is moving through already wavy water, it changes the wake that the speedboat produces (3). To complicate things further, these modified MJO waves the ENSO waves are now both traveling at different speeds at the top of the atmosphere and interact with each other, in the same way the wakes from two boats interfere. The interaction of these waves and their signals plays a role in U.S. weather via changes in pressure, temperature, etc. Two climate signals interfering (i.e., combining) with each other. Bold blue curve sketches the result of the combination. Horizontal bars indicate conceptual thresholds for occurrence of extremely wet and dry events. Animation adapted by Climate.gov from The waves from the MJO and the waves from ENSO together impact U.S. rainfall through constructive or destructive interference. occurs when two waves are in phase (4), and the resultant wave has a much larger amplitude, resulting in a stronger signal than either of the individual waves. The opposite, called , occurs when two waves are out of phase and cancel each other (5). You may have experienced destructive signal interference when your radio signal gets interrupted by another station and you hear a mix of two stations or no sound at all. We can analyze constructive and destructive interference from the MJO and ENSO by looking at each U.S. rainfall signal individually (6). We can specifically look at the U.S. rainfall contribution from both the MJO and ENSO, for example, when the enhanced MJO convection is over Indonesia and an El Niño is happening, or when the MJO convection is in the central Pacific and La Niña is occurring. Since the MJO changes phase much faster than ENSO, we often see persist for an entire season, whereas the rainfall from the MJO can change weekly. Constructive interference from the MJO and ENSO occurs when either wet or dry conditions occur in the same region simultaneously from both phenomena. Their signals are added together and the result is a much wetter- or- drier-than-average region. Destructive interference occurs when the same region experiences opposite signals from the MJO and ENSO, partially or fully masking one another. Precipitation in mm/day broken down by active MJO phase during the winter months (Nov-Apr) of the 1998-2001 La Niña event (cold ENSO phase). The plot shows MJO-only rain (left), ENSO-only rain (center), and MJO + ENSO rain (right). Black boxes denote prominent areas of constructive (top) or destructive (bottom) interference. This example shows that both constructive (amplified signal) and destructive (weakened signal) can happen during different MJO phases in the same ENSO event. Climate.gov image based on data from . Destructive interference can even lead to a total wipeout of a signal. We saw that during the 1998-2001 La Niña event. The wave from La Niña resulted in drier-than-normal conditions in the Southeast U.S., a common characteristic of La Niñas. However, when the MJO was either just forming or dissipating during the La Niña event, it brought wetter-than-average conditions to the same region. These two waves destructively interfered, essentially canceling each other out. (7) The result was simply average rainfall (no wetter- or drier-than-normal conditions) for that time period in the Southeast U.S. Constructive interference can also have notable impacts since the result is an intensified signal. This occurred in December 2015 when both the MJO and ENSO signals brought large amounts of rain to the Mississippi basin region, leading to massive flooding ( ) (8). , rapidly developing droughts that can persist for weeks to months, can also be attributed to constructive interference. One such example was the summer of 2000 flash drought in the Southern U.S. when an ongoing La Niña event and active MJO both likely contributed dry signals to the region. Typical impacts of La Niña on U.S. winter temperature and precipitation. Such impacts have been associated with past episodes, but all impacts aren't seen with every episode. NOAA Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. Analysis of these events shows just how connected the tropics and the United States can be. Understanding how these waves interfere can improve our one-to-two week and monthly climate . A longer lead time in a forecast for massive flooding or drought events can save lives, property, and money if our climate models can catch the waves from the MJO and ENSO. These atmospheric waves may not have us sitting on top of the world like the Beach Boys told us, but they are traveling pretty close (top of the troposphere to be exact) and could still have a big impact on the California surf. (1) This coupling between deep convection and a circulation pattern characterized by low-level convergence, upper-level divergence, and vice versa (sinking motion due to upper-level convergence and low-level divergence) is similar to the tropical . (2) The location of above-average and below-average tropical convection can be seen in this graphic on the . (3) It is also believed that since the MJO itself is altered, then so are the atmospheric waves it produces that travel to the U.S. (4) In-phase waves have their highest and lowest points aligned. (5) Out-of-phase waves will drastically reduce the amplitude, or height, of the waves which causes the resultant wave to be nearly flat and lose its signal. (6) We analyze the signals based on the state of each system: location of convective storms for the MJO and sea surface temperatures for ENSO. We then calculate the amount of rainfall that each signal contributed during specific conditions in the tropics, that is whether each contributed to wetter or drier conditions than average. (7) We saw this in California during the massive 2015-16 El Niño event. California often experiences much wetter-than-normal conditions during El Niños. During this event, however, the El Niño signal brought only a small amount of rain ( ; ) and the MJO brought a dry signal to the California region. When the two are added together, the signals slightly cancel each other out and played a role in the drought in the California region during that time. During this particular case, El Niño did bring the expected rain, and the MJO brought dryness, and the result contributed to a drought in California during a time when they expected a lot of rain. (8) According to NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information ( ), December 2015 was the only month in their 121-year period of record with both the title of warmest and wettest month. Furthermore, the severe precipitation events caused record flooding, severe weather, and heavy snowfall resulting in over 50 fatalities, the deadliest weather event of 2015. Arcodia, M. C., B. P.

Countries participating in the treaty develop their —known as Nationally Determined Contributions—to meet the agreed-on targets. Countries are free to develop a mixture of policies that is most economical or advantageous for them. They must report on their successes or failures to meet their voluntary targets at the annual COP meetings. Climate simulations show that to limit warming to 1.5°C, with no overshoot, global carbon dioxide emissions from human sources must decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reach net zero human emissions around 2050. To limit global warming to below 2°C, models indicate we need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 25% over 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2070. According to the International Energy Administration’s (see Figure 3.2 on page 127), if all the pledges that individual countries have announced so far are implemented fully and on time, Earth’s temperature is likely to rise by about 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100.

The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA ), with periodic guest contributors.

TAO buoy riders. NOAA photo taken on February 11, 2011. Photographer: Lieutenant Elizabeth Crapo, NOAA Corps. Ok, you may be confused. And I’m sure my editor likely recoiled at how obtuse that opening love letter was. But let me explain. We at the ENSO Blog love ocean and weather observations. And what better way to express that than through my attempt at an 18 century love letter. And what better object of my love than the Tropical Atmospheric Ocean—or TAO—moored buoy array across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. In a world of assumptions when it comes to ENSO, TAO provides something rare for the middle of the Pacific: real-time observations of atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Yes! But not just one buoy! TAO refers to a group of around 70 ocean moorings anchored to the sea floor across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These buoys measure atmospheric things like the winds, relative humidity, and air temperature and oceanic things like the sea surface temperature. One of the most important things the buoys measure is temperatures of the ocean at 10 depths in the upper 500 m (1640ft) of the ocean (more on why these matter later). The moorings are placed along a north-south line from the western Pacific (165°E) to the eastern Pacific (95°W), as if placed by the most methodical Battleship player ever. And their placement in this specific area of the world is not random. TAO exists to help monitor and study climate phenomenon across the Pacific with a heavy emphasis on El Niño and La Niña. Plotted in blue circles are the sites of NOAA's TAO moored buoy array located across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Shaded in the background are the May 2017 sea surface temperature anomalies where red areas represent warmer than average conditions and blue areas represent colder than average conditions. The TAO buoy array helps scientists monitor and understand ENSO. NOAA Climate.gov image with sea surface temperature data from the and TAO buoy data from NOAA's These one-of-a-kind oceanic moorings owe their existence to a large international climate research program called the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere program , or TOGA, which began in 1985, shortly after the 1982-83 El Niño—one of the three strongest on record back to 1950--caught scientists off-guard. TOGA’s mission was to help figure out how predictable tropical phenomena (like ENSO) are on seasonal to multi-year timescales, and how much observations in the tropics could improve climate predictions. Locations of sea surface temperature observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set ( ) for 20-year periods starting with the 1860-1879 period and ending with 1980-1999. The colors represent the percentage of months with at least one sea surface temperature measurement in each 2 degree by 2 degree grid box. The darker the color the higher the percentage of months in each 20-year period that has an observation. NOAA Climate.gov image with data from . Prior to TOGA and TAO, there simply were not many observations across the Pacific Ocean to help scientists predict and understand ENSO. Scientists were like a person walking around with poor vision and no glasses. And when the ENSO picture is blurry, it can mean that even one of the strongest El Niños on record can catch the world by surprise, leaving little time for communities to prepare for the . While there were some ocean observations from ships, buoys and satellites, nothing with the capabilities of the TAO existed until…well, TAO. This includes TAO’s ability not only to measure the surface but also the sub-surface in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. As Michelle has , the subsurface can be where all the “action” is in a developing El Niño and La Niña, as that is where oceanic Kelvin waves reside. In fact, the first demonstration that an “oceanic Kelvin wave” actually helps to move warmer sub-surface water east during El Niño was very new in the early 1980s. Thanks to TAO, scientists now literally it and more importantly can track it in near-real-time. One classic example of this is how well TAO captured the 1997-1998 El Niño, which is widely regarded as the strongest since 1950. After the disaster of not seeing the 1982-83 event until it was too late, scientists--using observations like TAO--were able to forewarn the world many months prior to the peak of the 1997-98 event. A , or hovmoller diagram, of the anomalous depth of the 20°C isotherm (line of constant temperature) was across the equatorial Pacific Ocean (2°N to 2°S) during the 1997-1998 El Niño event as recorded in a 5-day running average by the TAO moored buoy observations. The metric shown is the anomaly (departure from long-term average) in depth of the layer of ocean water with a temperature of 20°C. If this layer is lower than usual (positive values), that means more warm water. If the layer is higher than usual (negative values), there is less warm water than average. The dark line represents a 0m anomaly. NOAA Climate.gov image from data processed by the Instituto Geofisico Del Peru using the 1981-2010 climatology obtained from the NCEP Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS). TAO buoy data available from NOAA's . Plus, once the observations in the Pacific Ocean came online, they were put into our climate models, greatly improving the models’ ability to predict ENSO events. The key revolutionary aspect of TAO was the ability to make subsurface temperature observations. Research has shown that TAO data has reduced the uncertainty—made things less blurry—in tropical Pacific temperature analyses which are used not only to monitor ENSO but also to provide the initial view of the ocean in seasonal forecast models across the globe (Xue et al 2017). After all, just like a person with 20-400 vision putting on their first set of glasses, models tend to “see” the future better if they start with a more accurate view of the current state of the ocean and atmosphere. Well, their data can be found in hundreds of scientific journal articles, as TAO has been the predominant source of observations in the upper portion of the equatorial Pacific Ocean since the mid-1980s. In that time, TAO has not only become our global watchdog for developments in the Pacific Ocean but also has become vital in our ever-deepening understanding of just what makes ENSO tick. It has been TAO data, for instance, which has helped to corroborate on ENSO formation. And will continue to do so for as long as TAO floats across the Pacific. Deploying a TAO buoy. TAO is a moored buoy array maintained by NOAA located across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Its surface and sub-surface observations are critical for our understanding of ENSO. NOAA photo taken on February 11, 2011. Photographer: Lieutenant Elizabeth Crapo, NOAA Corps. Hopefully! But it’s important to note that after all these years, TAO’s continued existence has never been a guarantee. TOGA, the program which gave us TAO, ended in 1994. Since then TAO has been supported by a myriad of sources. Currently, it is supported by NOAA as part of the operational ENSO observing system. It is important that we keep these buoys around. We wouldn’t want to lose our ENSO glasses. So I am glad that I could show some love to some incredibly important marine-based ocean observations. Now if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go see what TAO is reporting today. McPhaden, M.J., A.J. Busalacchi, D.L.T. Anderson, “A TOGA retrospective.” . . 86-103. Doi:10.5670/oceanog.2010.26.

Rainfall estimates from NOAA's Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service for July 15, 2017. Numerous monsoonal thunderstorms dropped large amounts of rain across central and southern Arizona leading to flash floods. NOAA climate.gov image using data from NOAA's . The rains fell during an active period of the North American Monsoon, or (within the U.S.) the Southwest Monsoon. During this time, intense rainfall can fall over the usually dry terrain of the southwestern United States including Phoenix, Arizona and California. Though brief, these strong thunderstorms can dump a lot of rainfall. On July 15, storms dropped between 0.5-4 inches of rain across parts of southern Arizona, with much of this rainfall occurring over a relatively short period of time. The terrain north of Phoenix in the Tonto National Forest can be rugged and mountainous, full of narrow canyons. When heavy rain falls over this landscape it doesn’t get absorbed into the rock-hard ground. Instead, it runs off into normally dry river beds called arroyos or washes, which become raging rivers. Along the way, the water picks up whatever is in its path, so by the time it reaches miles down the river, the flow is mixed with dirt, rocks, brush, and trees. In Tonto National Forest, making matters worse, a wildfire in June not only made the ground more resistant to absorbing water (charred vegetation and ash are hydrophobic), but left burnt brush and trees to be swallowed up by rushing water. Flash floods are a major concern every summer across the Southwest for these exact reasons. As a final threat, the floods can appear to occur out of nowhere—in the midst of a perfectly sunny day—because isolated storms tens of miles away can be the source of the water that turns babbling brooks into deadly torrents. Tragically, on July 15, a flash flood took the lives of many members of one family out enjoying a day in nature. Monthly rainfall in inches averaged from 1981-2010 for Tucson, Arizona. The most rainfall occurs during July and August coinciding with the arrival and strengthening of the North American Monsoon. NOAA Climate.gov image using data from the . Nope. India does not have sole custody of monsoons. But the mechanisms for why there is a summer monsoon in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico are similar to those in other parts of the world. During the summer months, the sun begins to heat up the arid landscapes of the U.S. Southwest and Mexico. The heated ground warms the overlying air, causing it to rise; the air pressure at the surface drops. The atmosphere likes to keep things equal, so it tries to push air towards places where air is leaving. For western North America, that means moisture-rich air from over the eastern Pacific and Gulf of California rushes in at low levels of the atmosphere. Meanwhile, higher up in the atmosphere there is more air than normal—also known as higher pressure. Because air tends to circle clockwise around a block of high pressure, easterly winds also bring in moisture from the . As this moist air interacts with higher terrain, thunderstorms form. Unlike more tropical monsoons, where it isn’t uncommon for rain to fall nearly daily for weeks or months, the North American Monsoon does not mean constant rainfall as the mountains aren’t as high and the circulation patterns aren’t as strong. Instead, the rains can be episodic. Heavy when there is enough moisture but also separated by periods of dry conditions—another reason people may be caught off guard by flood-producing storms. In general, the monsoon kicks off in northwest Mexico in June and expands northward, reaching the southwestern United States in early July. By mid-July, the monsoon is well underway across Mexico and the desert Southwest. The monsoon comes to end as summer does—and the intense land surface heating subsides—with rainfall diminishing through September. The monsoon does have benefits for the area by providing relief from the intense summer sun, refilling reservoirs, and providing the bulk of the annual precipitation for the region. But it also can cause deadly flash floods like those seen recently. So if you do find yourself in the Southwest this summer, make sure to pay attention to forecasts from the to be aware of any potential storms. Help us improve our content"

After a year of dominance, El Niño released its hold on the tropical Pacific in May 2024, according to . El Niño—the warm phase of the (ENSO), our planet’s single largest natural source of year-to-year variations in seasonal climate—has been disrupting climate in the tropics and beyond since May 2023, likely contributing to many months of record-high , extreme , and Central America, opposing wet and dry , , and record-setting . (That’s an incomplete list! I’d love to see readers use the comments to identify all the seasonal climate extremes over the past year that are consistent with the typical influence of El Niño.) That’s a lot of climate upheaval. Is ENSO going to give us some time to idle in (a state in between the warmer and cooler extremes of the El Niño-La Niña cycle) and catch our breaths? Not much, apparently. The tropical Pacific’s climate pendulum appears to be swinging back toward its other extreme: . In the Pacific, La Niña brings cooler-than-average temperatures in the central-eastern part of the basin, stronger winds both near the surface and at high altitudes, and heavier rain than normal over Indonesia and the rest of the Maritime Continent. The forecasting team thinks there’s a 65 percent chance that La Niña will arrive by July-September. For each upcoming 3-month season, NOAA forecasts the chances of El Niño (red bars), La Niña (blue bars), or neutral conditions (gray bars) in the tropical Pacific. Neutral is overwhelmingly favored for the May-July period (labeled MJJ on the graph), but the chances for La Niña increase rapidly as soon as the June-August (JJA) period. By late summer (July-August-September, JAS), odds of La Niña are 65 percent. NOAA graph by Michelle L’Heureux. That timing means there’s a pretty good chance La Niña will be around to influence the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. (1) Even if the transition occurs more slowly, the odds of La Niña being in place by Northern Hemisphere winter are still 85 percent, which is similar to the NOAA forecast in previous months. Given those odds, it’s probably a good idea to refresh your memory of the on U.S. temperature and precipitation. Emily explained in our April update that the atmospheric part of El Niño—weak-to-absent east-to-west trade winds across the tropical Pacific, dryness over Indonesia, strong convection and rainfall east of the International Dateline—had more or less shut down by early April. But surface water temperatures in the central-eastern tropical Pacific were still more than a degree Celsius (nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the long-term average (long-term = 1991-2020), and some parts of the tropics still appeared to be Forecasters concluded it was too soon to issue El Niño’s curtain call. Without the atmosphere reinforcing those warm anomalies ( means “difference from average”), however, surface temperatures cooled off significantly through April and May. We’re already seeing stronger easterly (from the east) trade winds, which have cooled the overheated surface waters. You can see it happening in the animation below. This animation shows weekly sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean compared to average from March 18-June 9, 2024. Orange and red areas were warmer than average; blue areas were cooler than average. Warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the key ENSO-monitoring region of the tropical Pacific (outlined with black box) have started to be replaced by cooler-than-average waters—a sign that La Niña may be brewing. NOAA Climate.gov animation, based on Coral Reef Watch Data and maps from in its own browser window. The most recent weekly and monthly observations from the key ENSO-monitoring region (dubbed ) show surface temperatures are close to average, and now cooler, deeper waters have begun surfacing. Now that both the atmosphere and the ocean have shifted away from El Niño, the event is truly over. Beneath the surface of the eastern pacific, a pool of cool water has been lurking for several months in standby mode, ready to re-supply the surface and intensify the cool anomaly required to create and maintain La Niña. Water temperatures in the top 300 meters (1,000 feet) of the tropical Pacific Ocean compared to the 1991–2020 average in February–April 2024. NOAA Climate.gov animation, based on data from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. Of course, one of the most common questions we receive from readers is how strong do we expect the predicted La Niña to be? As far as model forecasts go, it’s too soon to put much stock in the forecasts: we’re just barely out of the notorious spring predictability barrier. The is still pretty wide. So, how about historical events? Does coming off a relatively strong El Niño like the recent one mean the developing La Niña will also be strong? That’s the question I posed to the team via email earlier this week. In true scientist fashion, Michelle answered me with a plot (2), which I have translated below. Since 1950, there have been 10 cases in which the ENSO climate pattern flipped from El Niño to La Niña with no neutral winter in between. Each line on this graph shows the evolution of sea surface temperature anomalies in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific (the key ENSO-monitoring region) through the switch. Many, but not all, of the strongest El Niños (red lines) evolved into strong La Niñas. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on analysis by Michelle L'Heureux. First things first, let’s acknowledge that there have only been 10 times in the historical record where ENSO flipped from El Niño into La Niña within a year. That’s not enough examples to draw any conclusions from. Still, it’s interesting to look at what we have and speculate as to what it might mean, so that’s all I am doing here. Each line on the graph above represents a year in which the tropical Pacific shifted from El Niño to La Niña with no neutral winter in between. The lines are colored based on the strength of the El Niño: red for strong events (peak Niño 3.4-region sea surface temperature anomalies above 1.5 ˚C, or 2.7 ˚F), orange for moderate events (peak anomaly between 1 and 1.5 ˚C, or 1.8-2.7 ˚F), and pink for weak events (peak anomaly less than 1 ˚C, or 1.8 ˚F). The relationship between the strength of the El Niño and the strength of the subsequent La Niña is kinda messy. It’s unlikely, but not impossible, for weak and moderate El Niños to lead to a strong La Niña (Niño 3.4 temperature anomaly of more than 1.5 ˚C below average). Only one of the pink and orange lines gets below that threshold. Meanwhile, 4 of the 6 strong El Niños do evolve into strong La Niñas. But before we put too much stock in that pattern, we should note that the strongest El Niño of all (top red line at the left hand side of the graph) wound up developing into the weakest La Niña (3). So…yeah. It’s complicated. The likely strength of the upcoming La Niña will become clearer the closer we get, and you’ll hear more about that in coming posts. Of course, it’s also important to remember that the strength of a given El Niño or La Niña isn’t a good predictor of the strength of the temperature or precipitation impacts in a particular place. Stronger events do make it more likely that places prone to be influenced by El Niño or La Niña will experience level of their typical impacts, but they don’t necessarily lead to impacts. In other words, even a moderate or weak La Niña can have a strong impact on a given place. So it’s important to pay attention to what we already know, which is that odds are very high (85% chance) that this winter will feature La Niña. If you’d like to know more about what a La Niña winter might mean for your part of the world, here are some great places to start. Hi. Have you contemplated using the RONI data to measure the equatorial temperatures? Submitted by on Thu, 06/13/2024 - 14:38 I'm impressed! Not many people are familiar with Relative ONI (RONI) which came out of that work that Rebecca mentioned in footnote #3. For the last several years, CPC has monitored RONI on the side and it is located here: As you can see, the RONI is 0.1C for MAM 2024, which is considerably different from the 0.7C value in the traditional ONI. However, NOAA's official alert system is based on the traditional Nino3.4/ONI values, so at this point, we follow the traditional indices.

We didn't have any kind of Winter weather here in the Southeast ( Kentucky,) and usually we have a colder, snowier Winter in past ENSO / El Nino events. How could we be entering ENSO / neutral when the current PDO is a negative 2.97 ? That's ENSO / La Nina right ? I looked up the PDO readings, and found that the last ENSO / neutral reading 0.00 was December 2019. With ENSO / La Nina a sure bet for this Fall and Winter, and it will be reacting with the atmosphere, because it's forming on a negative PDO. Here in Kentucky we will most likely experience another snowless Winter. A longtime ago ( 1917 - 18 ) we were in an La Nina year and recorded a very cold and snowy Winter. The records showed that this happen. Please explain. Adding, the last cold and snowy Winter here in Kentucky was in 2015 -16. Under an ENSO / El Nino with a positive PDO. Thank You, Stephen S. Submitted by on Fri, 06/14/2024 - 12:27 Hi-- we are favoring La Nina with a peak probability of 85% so still not 100% (some would consider that a sure bet). ENSO is based on coupled physics that happen within the tropical Pacific Ocean, so we primarily focus on the tropics. The PDO is interesting insofar as it may feedback on the topics, but that effect is considered small on seasonal timescales and more relevant to decadal averages.

There is no one month where all of the sudden the accuracy gets considerably better, but generally the biggest rate of change is April-May-June, so there is an argument that we're over the hump, so to speak. With that said, the accuracy of our forecasts will increase the closer we get to the season that we are forecasting. So every month helps with the fine tuning. You're right that the forecasted intensity is not as strong as it was in previous months. Our latest ENSO reflects those changes (this updates once a month w/ the discussion).

I live in the Altiplano in Mexico which is the higher drier region in the north and center of the country and very often it seems that El Niño and La Niña both bring us even less rain, but of course it is not certain. Still we seem to do best with a neutral period. We've been in severe drought for years so I was hoping for neutral but alas, we are going to get a Niña.

El Nino vs La Nina is too complicated for me to decipher, but I think El Nino was definitely the cause. Submitted by on Tue, 06/18/2024 - 10:45 Well...Based on past episodes, El Niño has a small and not very reliable influence on summer temps in the contiguous U.S. It tends to have a bigger and more consistent impact on winter temperature and precipitation. We know that reason we are seeing increasingly frequent occurrences of record heat in the U.S. is long-term global warming. Averaged across Texas, summer temperatures have warmed by a tenth of a degree each decade since 1895, mostly due to warming nighttime temperatures. Scientists would have to do a kind of scientific study called an in order to understand how much El Niño or other kinds of natural variability also contributed to any specific year's record heat. Submitted by on Fri, 06/21/2024 - 13:48 In reply to by The flip from a 3 year La Nina, to 1 year El Nino, then quickly back to La Nina is really interesting. It seems there isn't symmetry between the 2 phases. Would it be accurate to say ENSO processes are similar to the process of a volcano gathering molten magma before eruption? As well, there have been numerous explanations for the ENSO cycles (trade winds being the huge factor) but one of the more recent parsimonious explanations is volcano like as it states: \"Think of the tropical Pacific as if it is a battery storing a charge, and the charge is thermal radiation coming in from the sun. Every cool La Nina phase is like a battery gathering and storing a charge from the sun, while every El Nino phase is like a battery discharging its thermal store.\" This seems logical and to the point, without getting into trade winds and other complicated dynamic atmospheric processes. But is the above description accurate? The above description does help differentiate ENSO as a standard atmospheric process vs. being a climate change process, which seems to be a popular misguided view. Submitted by on Wed, 06/19/2024 - 13:30 The idea that during La Niña the tropical Pacific is storing energy--\"charging like a battery\"— and during El Niño it is discharging energy seems like a reasonable analogy for the of the ocean and atmosphere processes that drive the ENSO pattern phenomenon. But climate scientists aren't just interested in the result; they want to understand why and how things happen in the climate system. You say a battery analogy allows us to dispense with all those messy and \"complicated atmospheric dynamic processes.\" But a simple battery analogy would provide no explanation for all the parts of the system that we can easily observe. It doesn't explain why \"the battery\" is located in the western tropical Pacific and not the whole Pacific. It doesn't explain why the battery would discharge as opposed to endlessly accumulating energy. It doesn't explain why there is no equally strong battery in the tropical Atlantic Ocean or the tropical Indian Ocean, etc. In other words, if we ever want to understand why and how the battery discharges--which we do, since it has such a strong influence on seasonal climate—we have to dig into the complicated stuff. As the quote usually attributed to Albert Einstein says, \"Scientific explanations [theories] should be as simple as possible...but not simpler.\" Submitted by on Fri, 06/21/2024 - 14:10 In reply to by Thank you for this! There has been much made of La Nina and El Nino as \"drivers of climate extremes\" in the news since the really big 1997-98 El Nino event. Yet the news rarely explains what the 2 phases mean or involve, beyond being shorter term 'cool weather' and 'warm weather' climate phases. The battery charge and discharge analogy seemed quite apt and very easy for any lay person to grasp, if not a little too conveniently simple. As far as 'heat discharge' is concerned, a simple volcano analogy makes some sense. But then that begs the question, which might not strictly be an ENSO phase question, whether the equilibrium between cool Ninas and warm Ninos is shifting, as we've seen warmer oceans even through the recent \"moderately strong\" 2020-23 La Nina. (After all, hearing stories of batteries overheating with analogies of ...suns going supernova can't be too far off at this rate... I digress) Surely we need more understanding of those dynamic, complicated atmospheric processes. A simple theory would be wonderful - there is much to comb through to, to begin to get close to having an idea of what's going on for the average lay person. But it is 100% worth it for those who want to know.

Your comment is a good reminder for those of us outside the tropics that for those actually in the tropics, the impacts of El Niño and La Niña are more consistent and potentially severe than they are in the subtropics and mid-latitudes, where the influence of El Niño and La Niña is weaker.

Thanks! Submitted by on Fri, 06/21/2024 - 05:05 Depending on what part of the Pac NW you mean, the influence of La Niña on precipitation can be pretty strong. You can look back at to see the patterns during 20 of the strongest La Niñas on record. That's total precip, though, not distinguishing rain from snow. Sometime before winter, we will probably do a La Niña version of , so stay tuned. You also have to keep in mind that long-term global warming is reducing snowfall in many U.S. locations; a percentage of winter precip that would have historically fallen as snow now falls as rain. So, it's possible that even if La Niña did historically tend to produce snowier winters in a particular place, it's impact may be more muted in today's warming climate.

One key point in her article was that weaker El Niños tend to be closer to the Central Pacific types and stronger El Niños tend to be closer to Eastern Pacific types. So I wouldn't necessarily classify the 6 strong events as CP events (with the caveat that, as I noted, there is nuance here) As for variables following the trends of the past two events, it's hard to compare when the sample size is n=2. The other difficulty is the impact the above-average ocean temperatures worldwide might be having as well.

Priscilla Submitted by on Wed, 07/03/2024 - 08:16 Hi Priscilla - Thanks for the report from Nairobi. I haven't seen that report, but I can confirm that El Nino likely had little to do with flooding in East Africa in May. The El Nino impact in Eastern Africa is strongest over the October–January period. Regarding Beryl, it's really difficult to attribute the strength of a single storm, and ENSO is currently neutral and so does not have much influence on global atmospheric circulation.

The tropical Pacific Ocean reflected neutral conditions—neither El Niño nor La Niña—in September. Forecasters continue to favor La Niña later this year, with an approximately it will develop in September–November. The probability of La Niña is a bit lower than last month, though, and it’s likely to be a weak event. La Niña is the cool phase of the , a pattern of alternating warmer (El Niño) and cooler surface waters in the tropical Pacific. Rising warm air in the tropics is what drives global atmospheric circulation, and therefore the , storm tracks, and resulting . ENSO’s varying sea surface temperature changes where the occurs, hence . ENSO is predictable several months in advance, and when you couple that predictability with our knowledge of how it changes global patterns, you get an early picture of potential upcoming weather and climate patterns. Let’s take a spin through recent conditions in the tropical Pacific. The threshold for La Niña is a sea surface temperature in the region in the central equatorial Pacific that is equal to or more than 0.5 °C below the long-term average. (Currently, is 1991–2020.) The most recent of the temperature difference from average in the Niño-3.4 region was -0.3 °C, and the September average was also -0.3 °C. Hurricane Helene’s devastating impacts on the Asheville, NC, region affected —see the footnote for details on our new data sources this month. Michelle and CPC’s Caihong Wen did extensive testing and determined that the temporary replacements have historically been very close to the ones we usually use, so we’re confident that ENSO-neutral conditions are still in place. This animation shows weekly sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean compared to average from July 1–September 29, 2024. Orange and red areas were warmer than average; blue areas were cooler than average. Warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the key ENSO-monitoring region of the tropical Pacific (outlined with black box) have started to be replaced by cooler-than-average waters—a sign that La Niña may be brewing. NOAA Climate.gov animation, based on Coral Reef Watch Data and maps from in its own browser window. There has been a region of cooler-than-average water in the central-eastern tropical Pacific in recent weeks, as you can see above, but it’s not quite crossing the threshold. Some aspects of the tropical atmosphere are still reflecting neutral, too. There was a region of stronger-than-average trade winds in the east-central tropical Pacific and a little bit of reduced rainfall over the central Pacific, but overall, no strong, distinct pattern of stronger-than-average trade winds or increased rainfall over Indonesia as we’d expect during an established La Niña. In fact, a couple weeks of average to weaker-than-average trade winds during September allowed the surface to warm a bit. If it seems like we’ve been stuck here in neutral for longer than we expected—we have! Last winter, models were predicting that La Niña would develop rapidly after the end of El Niño 2023–24. So what happened? Why are we still waiting? Didn’t I just say ENSO is predictable? Not exactly a . ENSO is predictable, but only in the big picture, meaning seasonal averages or longer. The signals that tell us that El Niño or La Niña are on the way, such as a large amount of cooler or warmer water under the ocean surface, or a particularly strong, long-lasting shift in the trade winds, are reliable indicators. Also, our computer climate models, which look at current conditions and make predictions based on mathematical and physical equations, are pretty good, especially after the (a time of year when predictions are especially difficult). However, small, , such as the weaker equatorial trade winds that occurred during September, can’t be predicted more than a couple of weeks (at best) in advance. They tend to have a disproportionate impact during borderline, more marginal situations when we are hovering near our ENSO thresholds. These small fluctuations can tip the scales one way or the other. In this case, they’ve added up to a slower and weaker La Niña development. That said, many of our models are holding steady for La Niña to develop shortly. Line graph showing observed and predicted temperatures (black line) in the key ENSO-monitoring region of the tropical Pacific from early 2024 though spring 2025. The gray shading shows the range of temperatures predicted by individual models that are part of the North American Multi Model Ensemble (NMME, for short). Most of the shading appears below the dashed blue line by the fall, meaning most models predict that temperature in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific will be cooler than average by at least 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit)—the La Niña threshold. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data provided by Climate Prediction Center. Forecasters have nudged the overall chance that La Niña will develop down a bit from last month, though. That means that, while La Niña is still favored, we’re less confident in La Niña emerging. Out of the three climate possibilities—La Niña, El Niño, and neutral—forecasts say that La Niña conditions are the most likely for the September–November season (blue bar over the SON label, 60% chance). NOAA Climate Prediction Center image. Also, if La Niña forms, it’s very likely this will be a weak event, with a maximum between -0.9 and -0.5 °C, in line with model predictions. In the historical record, which starts in 1950, only four La Niña events have formed this late in the year, with two forming in September–November and two in October–December. These were all either weak or on the border between weak and moderate. ENSO events are strongest in the winter, so there’s less time for this La Niña to grow from where we are now. The strength of an ENSO event, as gauged by its sea surface temperature departures, matters because stronger events change the atmospheric circulation more consistently, leading to more consistent impacts on temperature, rainfall, and other patterns. A weaker event makes it more likely that other weather and climate phenomena could play the role of spoiler. However, even a weak La Niña can factor into seasonal outlooks, because it can still nudge the global atmosphere. Next month, Nat will review what the models have to say about winter conditions, including how much they reflect La Niña’s expected impacts. Stay tuned here at the ENSO Blog—we’re all treat, no trick! In a recent Yale CC article A spike that lasts a year or more is not consistent with the secular, monotonic rise in temperature predicted by a GHG model. It could be a tipping point perhaps, but if the spike disappears, that does not make sense. So that leaves an El Nino or ocean-cycle cause, Hunga-Tonga response, or an aerosol change as has been suggested. No way is it a sunspot-related event IMO. As Gavin said, it's somewhat embarrassing not understanding the cause, but that's really in the context of not having a consensus to the cause of El Nino events in the first place. Or having an agreement of whether the AMO is an oscillation or not. It's good that Gavin Schmidt is honest in his appraisal of the difficulty in pinning this all down. Submitted by on Thu, 10/10/2024 - 14:10 Nature certainly can humble us in many ways, and the climate system often throws us curveballs (so it's not just for us ENSO forecasters and researchers). I agree that the magnitude of recent heat is still a mystery, but I disagree with the statement that \"A spike that lasts a year or more is not consistent with the secular, monotonic rise in temperature predicted by a GHG model.\" The rise of global mean temperatures in response to GHG forcing does not preclude the competing or reinforcing effects of internal variability or other radiative forcing agents, which could last days or decades. So, I agree that it's unsettling that we don't have a definitive answer for this spike, but that shortcoming doesn't necessarily say anything about consistency or inconsistency with the influence of GHG forcing on global mean temperature. Submitted by on Thu, 10/10/2024 - 17:18 In reply to by Noticed that in the interview article not one mention of the words CO2, GHG, greenhouse gas, climate change, or global warming as a mechanism for the conspicuous heat spike of the last 2 years. This could be overlooked by the author of the article, but the implication conveyed by Gavin Schmidt is that they're looking at something else, including ENSO. Yet it's not ENSO alone as observed with the large spikes in the AMO for the Atlantic and the IOD for the Indian ocean. Submitted by on Fri, 10/11/2024 - 11:04 In reply to by Enjoy the updates as always Emily, thanks! I've read on the past here that central based la Nina events are more common with weak events. At least currently looking at the SST maps the coldest SST locations are in the central Pacific. At least following SST graphs and the maps not much cold SSTs in the Nino 3 region. What do you think the odds are of a Central Based Modoki type La Nina? Submitted by on Thu, 10/10/2024 - 15:24 I cannot speak for Emily, but I can respond anyway. :-) The relationship between ENSO strength and east versus central/Modoki is stronger for El Nino than for La Nina. La Nina tends to be centered farther west than El Nino in general, so most La Ninas are \"Modoki-like\" to some extent (see ). That said, it's still possible this event could be centered farther east or west than normal. I've been more focused on trying to nail down the intensity of this even that I haven't focused so much on the spatial \"flavor.\" If I reach any new insights, I'll let you know. Submitted by on Thu, 10/10/2024 - 17:06 In reply to by Thanks Nathaniel! It seems the last several La Ninas were east based with colder Temps in the Nino 3 and Nino 1.2 regions. Submitted by on Thu, 10/10/2024 - 19:26 In reply to by why have copernicus and noah as well as the UAH presented different numbers for global average temps for the last 3 months? Submitted by on Sun, 10/13/2024 - 10:15 The different temperature datasets have differences in data sources and methods for filling in data gaps, and they often report their global mean changes with respect to different base periods. These differences in data/methods can lead to differences in global average temperature, but these differences are usually pretty small. To me, it looks like the global average temperature is pretty consistent among datasets, although there are small differences (like UAH had September 2024 as the warmest and ERA5 had it as the second warmest). Those differences look like they are within the typical range of uncertainty, but if I'm missing something, or if you noticed differences that look unusually large, please feel free to clarify.

        "meta_description": "In the past 60 years, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased 100 times faster than it did during the end of the last ice age.",
        "content": "Based on , global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was parts per million (“ppm” for short) in 2023, setting a new record high. The increase between 2022 and 2023 was 2.8 ppm—the 12 year in a row where the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by more than 2 ppm. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the in 2023 was 421.08. The modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2023, —a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from . Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred. Since the middle of the 20 century, annual emissions from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 36.6 billion tons in 2023 according to the . Carbon cycle experts estimate that natural “sinks”—processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere—on land and in the ocean absorbed the equivalent of about half of the carbon dioxide we emitted each year in the 2011-2020 decade. Because we put more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases every year. The more we overshoot what natural processes can remove in a given year, the faster the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide rises. In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.8± 0.1 ppm per year. Over the next half century, the annual growth rate tripled, reaching 2.4 ppm per year during the 2010s. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons—one gigaton is a billion metric tons—per year in the mid-20 century before skyrocketing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric CO data from and . CO emissions data from and the . Carbon dioxide is Earth’s most important : a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth’s surface and re-release it in all directions—including back toward Earth’s surface. Without carbon dioxide, Earth’s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing. By adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are supercharging the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations by the NOAA Global Monitoring Lab, in 2021 carbon dioxide alone was responsible for about two-thirds of the of all human-produced greenhouse gases. Another reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called .

Natural increases in carbon dioxide concentrations have periodically warmed Earth’s temperature during ice age cycles over the past million years or more. The warm episodes (interglacials) began with a small increase in incoming sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere due to variations in Earth’s orbit around the Sun and its axis of rotation. (For more details, see the “Milankovitch cycles and ice ages” section of our article.) That little bit of extra sunlight caused a little bit of warming. As the oceans warmed, they outgassed carbon dioxide—like a can of soda going flat in the heat of a summer day. The extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere greatly amplified the initial, solar-driven warming. Based on air bubbles trapped in mile-thick and other paleoclimate evidence, we know that during the ice age cycles of the past million years or so, atmospheric carbon dioxide never exceeded 300 ppm. Before the Industrial Revolution started in the mid-1700s, atmospheric carbon dioxide was 280 ppm or less. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO in parts per million (ppm) for the past 800,000 years based on ice-core data (light purple line) compared to 2022 concentration (bright purple dot). The peaks and valleys in the line show ice ages (low CO ) and warmer interglacials (higher CO ). Throughout that time, CO was never higher than 300 ppm (light purple dot, between 300,000 and 400,000 years ago). The increase over the last 60 years is 100 times faster than previous natural increases. In fact, on the geologic time scale, the increase from the end of the last ice age to the present (dashed purple line) looks virtually instantaneous. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov based on data from Lüthi, et al., 2008, via NOAA NCEI Paleoclimatology Program. By the time continuous observations began at Mauna Loa Volcanic Observatory in 1958, global atmospheric carbon dioxide was already 315 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in human history. In fact, the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide amounts were this high was , during the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period, when global surface temperature was 4.5–7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (2.5–4 degrees Celsius) warmer than during the pre-industrial era. Sea level was at least 16 feet higher than it was in 1900 and possibly as much as 82 feet higher. If global energy demand continues to grow rapidly and we meet it mostly with fossil fuels, human emissions of carbon dioxide could reach 75 billion tons per year or more by the end of the century. Atmospheric carbon dioxide could be 800 ppm or higher—conditions not seen on Earth for close to 50 million years.

        "content": "La actividad humana genera 60 veces, o más, la cantidad de dióxido de carbono que liberan los volcanes cada año. Erupciones grandes y violentas pueden igualar la tasa de emisiones de los seres humanos en las pocas horas que duran, pero son muy poco frecuentes y muy breves en comparación a las emisiones humanas anuales. De hecho, varios estados de los Estados Unidos emiten individualmente más dióxido de carbono en un año que todos los volcanes del planeta combinados. En la escala de emisiones de dióxido de carbono, las fuentes humanas superan por lejos a los volcanes. Ilustración del NOAA Climate.gov por Emily Greenhalgh. Las actividades humanas—principalmente la quema de carbón y otros combustibles fósiles, pero también la producción de cemento, la deforestación y otros cambios en el paisaje—emitieron aproximadamente 40 mil millones de toneladas métricas de dióxido de carbono en 2015. Desde el comienzo de la Revolución Industrial, más de 2 billones de toneladas métricas de dióxido de carbono han sido lanzadas a la atmósfera producto de la actividad humana, según el Proyecto Global del Carbón. Desde el comienzo de la Revolución Industrial, las emisiones humanas de dióxido de carbón provenientes de los combustibles fósiles y de la producción de cemento (línea verde) han aumentado más de 35 mil millones de toneladas métricas por año. Mientras que los volcanes (línea púrpura) producen menos de mil millones de toneladas métricas anualmente. Gráfico del NOAA Climate.gov basado en datos del Centro de Análisis de Información de Dióxido de Carbono (CDIAC, siglas en inglés) del Laboratorio Nacional Oak Ridge del Departamento de Energía y Burton et al., 2013. Los volcanes emiten dióxido de carbono de dos maneras: durante las erupciones y a través del magma subterráneo. El dióxido de carbono del magma subterráneo es liberado a través de grietas, rocas y suelos porosos, además del agua que alimenta lagos volcánicos y manantiales termales. Las estimaciones de las emisiones de dióxido de carbono globales producidas por volcanes deben tomar en cuenta tanto las fuentes en erupción como aquellas que no lo están. Gran parte del dióxido de carbono liberado los volcanes se emite a través de la desgasificación del magma subterráneo cuando el volcán no está en erupción. En esta foto, los gases volcánicos y el vapor se elevan desde el Monte Merapi, Indonesia, el 20 de mayo de 2012. Licencia de Creative Commons por Jimmy McIntyre. En un artículo científico de 2011, el investigador del Servicio Geológico de los Estados Unidos, Terry Gerlach, resumió cinco estimaciones anteriores de las tasas de emisión global de dióxido de carbono volcánico que habían sido publicadas entre 1991 y 1998. Estas estimaciones incluyeron estudios que databan de la década de 1970 y que se basaron en una gran variedad de mediciones, como muestreo directo y teledetección satelital. Las estimaciones globales se ubicaron en un rango de aproximadamente 0.3 ± 0.15 mil millones de toneladas métricas de dióxido de carbono por año, lo cual significa que las emisiones humanas de dióxido de carbono fueron más de 90 veces mayores que las emisiones globales de dióxido de carbono provenientes de volcanes. El 18 de mayo de 1980, el Monte Saint Helens sufrió una erupción explosiva, emitiendo una columna de cenizas, vapor y gases de hasta 60,000 pies por sobre el nivel del mar. Durante aproximadamente nueve horas las emisiones de dióxido de carbono del volcán podrían haber alcanzado las emisiones humanas, pero erupciones tan masivas son raras y pasajeras. Foto del Servicio Geológico de los Estados Unidos por Robert Krimmel. En 2013, otro grupo de científicos—Michael Burton, Georgina Sawyer y Domenico Granieri—publicaron una estimación actualizada usando más datos sobre las emisiones de dióxido de carbono del magma de superficie, que estuvieron disponibles años después de la última estimación global. Si bien los autores identificaron un rango amplio de variabilidad en las estimaciones, concluyeron que la mejor estimación general era de aproximadamente 0,6 mil millones de toneladas métricas de dióxido de carbono por año. Si bien es más alta que la estimación de Gerlach, la cantidad sigue siendo sólo una fracción de la producción de dióxido de carbono proveniente de las actividades humanas. Gerlach comentó en un correo electrónico: \"Tomado al pie de la letra, sus resultados significan que el CO antropogénico excede el CO volcánico global por al menos un factor de 60 veces\". Ocasionalmente, las erupciones son lo suficientemente potentes como para liberar dióxido de carbono a una tasa que iguala o incluso excede la tasa global de emisiones humanas durante unas pocas horas. Por ejemplo, Gerlach estimó que las erupciones del Monte Saint Helens (1980) y Pinatubo (1991) liberaron dióxido de carbono en una escala similar a la producción humana durante casi nueve horas. Las emisiones humanas de dióxido de carbono continúan día tras día, mes tras mes y año tras año. La actividad volcánica actual puede parecer menor en comparación a las emisiones de dióxido de carbono que estamos generando con la quema de combustibles fósiles para producir energía. Pero en el transcurso del tiempo geológico, los volcanes han ocasionalmente contribuido al calentamiento global con la producción de cantidades significativas de dióxido de carbono y otros gases de efecto invernadero. Por ejemplo, algunos geólogos plantean la hipótesis de que hace 250 millones de años una extensa inundación de lava emanó de manera continua desde la tierra en Siberia, tal vez por cientos de miles de años. Esta erupción a gran escala, y de larga duración, probablemente elevó las temperaturas globales lo suficiente como para causar una de las mayores extinciones en la historia de nuestro planeta. La actividad volcánica actual no ocurre en una escala tan masiva. Hoy en día, más que calentar el clima global, las erupciones volcánicas frecuentemente tienen un efecto opuesto. Eso es porque el dióxido de carbono no es lo único que los volcanes inyectan en la atmósfera. Incluso las erupciones pequeñas con frecuencia producen cenizas volcánicas y partículas de aerosol. Tomada por astronautas del Transbordador Espacial a principios de agosto de 1991, esta foto del pliegue de la Tierra muestra una doble capa de partículas de aerosol volcánico (interpretación de Self et al., 1999) que se propagó por la estratósfera tras la catastrófica erupción del Monte Pinatubo. Rodeando el globo a altitudes incluso mayores que aquellas de las nubes de las tormentas eléctricas, las partículas reflejaban tanta luz solar entrante que las temperaturas globales de la superficie se enfriaron durante dos años. Foto cortesía del Portal de Fotografía Astronauta de la Tierra. Ya sean producto de erupciones pequeñas o grandes, los aerosoles volcánicos reflejan la luz solar de regreso al espacio, enfriando el clima global. La erupción de 1815 del Monte Tambora produjo suficientes cenizas y aerosoles como para suspender el verano en Europa y América del Norte en 1816. Boden, T.A., Marland, G., Andres, R.J. (2015).

        "content": "Yearly surface temperature from 1880–2023 compared to the 20th-century average (1901-2000). Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on from the National Centers for Environmental Information. Given the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth’s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it means a significant increase in accumulated heat. That extra heat is driving regional and seasonal , reducing and , intensifying and changing habitat ranges for and —expanding some and shrinking others. As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions. In addition, it's clear that the rate of warming over the past few decades is much faster than the average rate since the start of the 20th century. Trends in annual surface temperature in the past few decades (1994-2023, bottom) compared to the trend since the start of the 20th century (1901-2023, top). Recent warming is much faster than the longer-term average, with some locations warming by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic, where the loss of reflective ice and snow amplifies the rate of warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. The concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100°F (55°C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget—how much sunlight Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat—over time. To calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies—the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they Across inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our According to the from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2023 ranked among the 7 warmest for that month, and the months in the second half of the year (June-December) were each their hottest on record. In July, August, and September, global temperatures were more than 1.0°C (1.8°F) above the long-term average—the first time in NOAA's record any month has breached that threshold.

For more regional details and 2023 climate statistics, see the from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Though warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's the combined land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.11° Fahrenheit (0.06° Celsius) per decade since 1850, or about 2° F in total. The rate of warming since 1982 is more than three times as fast: 0.36° F (0.20° C) per decade. According to the latest Synthesis Report ( ) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there is no debate about the cause of this warming trend: Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020. In the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report on the Physical Basis of Climate Change, experts summarized the relative influence of all things known to affect Earth's average surface temperature: The range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C [2.01 ˚F]. Over this period, it is that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability changed it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C. The amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities—burning fossil fuels and to a lesser extent clearing forests—add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon ( ) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide amounts increase each year. According to the , if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050, models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20 century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.

        "content": "Understanding Earth’s climate involves observation, analysis, peer-review, publication, and collaboration. For climate modeler Lisa Sloan and paleobotanist Scott Wing, collaboration also involved tears, a dartboard, and a rattlesnake beheading. It may sound unconventional, but their collaboration has shed light on one of the warmest—and most puzzling—periods from our planet’s past. Around 56 million years ago, Earth’s temperatures spiked. That period of time is known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM for short. It was one of the in Earth history. Global temperatures likely rose by 9 to 14°F (5 to 8°C) for thousands of years. Geologists and paleontologists have known about the high temperatures for decades, but questions remain. How did the spike affect life on Earth? Could it happen again? Deep ocean temperatures were generally high throughout the Paleocene and Eocene, with a particularly warm spike at the boundary between the two geological epochs around 56 million years ago. Temperatures in the distant past are inferred from proxies (oxygen isotope ratios from fossil ). \"Q\" stands of Quarternary.

Growing up in Pittsburgh, Lisa Sloan paid regular visits to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Looking at scenes of cavemen and other prehistoric life, she knew what she wanted to do when she grew up: make dioramas. By the time she went in college, her ambitions had shifted to medicine until, enrolled as a pre-med major, she took a geology class. She fell for ancient rocks the same way she had fallen for dioramas. She also took a computer class. It was the era of punch cards and hours of computer downtime, and one day, she found a library book on DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). “It was for an early climate model,” she recalls. “I was captivated.” Left: Modeled climate for the PETM, adapted from Sloan's 1990 paper in Geology. Right: Lisa Sloan, photo courtesy University of California, Santa Cruz. Bringing her cat along for overnight stints in the computer lab, Sloan keyed every line of that inch-and-a-half-thick DARPA book’s code into the university computer. “Computing was so primitive then, it was like taking a butter knife to surgery.” Even so, she had found her career. Soon after, one of her professors suggested they work together on a literal hot topic: the Eocene Epoch. Prior research on the early Eocene indicated that global temperature at the time was “equable,” or steady throughout the year, with few strong highs or lows. Sloan and her adviser ran a simulation and got a different result for the mid-latitudes of North America and Siberia. “We found that, no, it was not equable,” Sloan says. “It was cold in winter and hot in summer.” In 1990, they submitted their paper for publication, with Sloan as the lead author. “ was, and still is, the premier publication for papers like this. I didn’t even have a Ph.D. yet, but I got this paper published in .” It was June 1990, she recalls, and she was on top of the world. “And then this guy I’d never met, he wrote a stinging rebuke.” Scott Wing grew up in North Carolina, and like Sloan, he spent his childhood fascinated by our planet’s past. When he had free time in high school, he signed up for a college-level course at Duke University on human evolution. Impressed by the high school student, the professor suggested that Wing try some hands-on paleontological fieldwork. With his professor’s letter of introduction, Wing finally found someone willing to let a 17-year-old fossil hunter tag along, and in the summer of 1972, he spent several weeks digging fossils in Wyoming. Wing excavates fossils in Wyoming every summer. Photo courtesy Scott Wing. At first, Wing now reflects, fossils were just fun, cool prizes to dig out of the ground. His interest in what they could reveal about ancient climates came later. “I got interested in Mesozoic and Cenozoic plants because I was interested in climate change around that time. I got interested in climate change because I was interested in mammals. I wondered why they were evolving and changing shape,” Wing explains. “A good way to figure out climate is to study fossil plants.” Wing studies the rapid spread and diversification of flowering plants that occurred from the late Cretaceous Period through the Eocene Epoch, roughly 70 million to 50 million years ago. Wyoming, where he digs fossils yearly, was home to palm trees and crocodiles around that time. In fact, so was the Arctic. By the time he read Sloan’s paper in , Wing was an established scientist at the Smithsonian Institution. He knew his fossil plants. And he knew her paper had to be wrong. Sloan and her adviser finished their paper with a caveat: “[I]f unequivocable data indicating warmth well within continental boundaries at high or middle latitudes can be found, these data would be crucial and would indicate either a fundamental flaw in our knowledge of the climate system or a lack of understanding of the factors that have influenced climate in Earth history.” In his rebuttal, Wing quoted the caveat, then wrote, “Such data already exist in the paleontological literature,” He included a table of specific examples. a fossil crocodile collected from the Green River Formation in southwestern Wyoming, is an example of warmer conditions in North America during the Eocene Epoch. This specimen is now on display in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. by Flickr user James St. John. Sloan went from elation at publishing a paper in a prestigious journal before she completed her Ph.D. to wondering if her career was over before she completed her Ph.D. “I cried my eyes out for days,” she admits. A buddy wrote a fake response to Wing’s rebuttal—presumably something unprintable in the peer-reviewed literature—and suggested she mount Wing’s paper on a dartboard. She took his advice. Sloan knew about the fossil record of a much warmer climate during the early Eocene. She simply hadn’t been convinced that year-round warmth was the only possible interpretation. Beyond that, she explains, “I was trying to show that this is what the state-of-the-art computer models say: ‘We have a problem here.’” published Wing’s rebuttal and Sloan’s response to it in May 1991. In October of that year, Sloan attended the Geological Society of America’s annual meeting, in San Diego. At lunch one day with a couple colleagues, she found herself sitting across the table from Wing. “We jousted a bit,” Sloan says. But to her amazement, she realized she didn’t actually hate him after meeting him in person. After the meeting, she remembers, “I really dug into my research.” With computer advances in the early 1990s, models got better. A little. “It went from going into surgery with a butter knife to going into surgery with a crappy steak knife,” Sloan says dryly. She also found she could turn to Wing for verification of her research. “Scott and I started checking each other’s work.” Plants near rivers and lakes can drop their leaves into the water where rapid burial might preserve those leaves in the fossil record. by Flickr user Matt Dean. Trees commonly line rivers, but a short distance away, plant life may be completely different—and unlikely to leave any fossils. So, although fossils provide glimpses of ancient climates and landscapes, they don’t provide a complete picture. Climate models can fill in the gaps left by Earth’s incomplete fossil record. from Wikimedia Commons. In 1994, Sloan published another paper in This time, she described the results of two simulations of climate conditions during the PETM: one with six times Earth’s current level of carbon dioxide, and another with two times the current level of carbon dioxide plus a massive North American lake. Fossils had shown Wing and his colleagues that an expansive lake system once existed around the present-day Green River in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado Higher carbon dioxide concentrations and a big lake system did the trick. Modeled temperatures in North America and Siberia were higher than in her 1990 simulation, and consistent with the abundance of warm-climate fossils from the PETM. “That’s one of my favorite papers ever,” she says. Sloan and Wing were good friends by the time he decided to take a sabbatical from the Smithsonian in 1997–1998. Now a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Sloan invited Wing and his family to spend the year in Santa Cruz. Wing and Sloan taught a seminar together. This time it was Wing who scrambled up the learning curve. At the end of the seminar, one of Sloan’s students told him, “We are going to miss you, Scott. You ask all the dumb questions that we’d like to ask.” While Wing was on sabbatical, Sloan joined Wing’s crew for fieldwork at Polecat Bench, Wyoming. Here, Wing stands in front of the newly christened expedition vehicle, in between a grad student (left) and a local rancher (right) and the rancher’s excellent field dog, Pepper (far right). Despite having to help push their subpar SUV out of a dry wash at one point, Sloan still has fond memories of the fossil dig. Photo courtesy Lisa Sloan. Sloan once joined Wing and his students for fieldwork at Polecat Bench, Wyoming . Field conditions in the Bighorn Basin were primitive. Participants had their own sleeping tents, and each morning, everybody gathered around the cook tent. There was no shower, and toilet facilities consisted of a shovel for digging oneself a deeply personal hole. But what Sloan remembers most was the snake. “One morning, somebody heard a rattlesnake,” Sloan recalls. “Everybody looked at Scott. He nodded, picked up the shovel and Whack!” Wing beheaded the rattlesnake with a single shovel blow. “I didn’t see it coming because he’s such a mild-mannered person,” Sloan says. “Never underestimate a paleontologist.” Models used to simulate ancient climates have improved since 1990, offering better spatial resolution and a much better fit with the fossil evidence. It’s pretty clear, says Wing, that a spike in greenhouse gases during the PETM caused the spike in global temperatures, but the precise combination of gases—carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor—is still under debate. Wing thinks that the source was mostly carbon dioxide. He suspects that some came from volcanoes, and some from organic carbon. Sloan seconds volcanoes, but adds the possibility of methane released from shallow, icy sediments as seas warmed. A frozen methane clathrate serves as a small apartment complex for methane ice worms. Thawing clathrates produce a . by Flickr user NOAA Photo Library. Whatever the exact sequence of events that led to the PETM warming, the fossil record documents big impacts to plants and animals. hampered shell building, and roughly half of the living on the bottom of the deep sea went extinct. In places like Wyoming, the dramatic temperature changes wiped out some plant populations, and some mammal species turned puny. Plants suffered in other ways. Leaf fossils from the PETM show increased insect damage. This might be down to the fact that lots of bugs like heat. It might also be down to the fact that higher carbon dioxide levels can spur plant growth, but the faster-growing plants are often less nutritious. The average bug probably had to eat more to survive. Leaves have been on insect menus for millions of years. by Flickr user Sandy Sarsfield. Fossils frequently preserve insect damage to leaves, including this specimen from the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Photo courtesy Scott Wing. In a in 2016, Wing explained that the PETM likely resulted from the release of about 5,000 billion tons of carbon over several thousand years. That’s about the amount of carbon that we will release if we burn Earth’s entire reservoir of fossil fuels. Humans haven’t burned the entire reservoir yet, but we are going through it at a much faster rate than anything that happened 56 million years ago. “This is like the PETM on steroids,” he told the audience. Then he pointed out something even more sobering about the PETM: The warming lasted for about 150,000 years. Wing discusses the lingering effects to greenhouse gas emissions at the . Screen capture from YouTube. Looking back on decades of research, Sloan admits to feeling frustrated, discouraged that models haven’t made more progress in the past three decades. Retired now from the University of California, she jokes that she’s “in science rehab.” She still has fond memories of working with her one-time nemesis. “It’s amazing how two people who were so at odds became such good friends.” Wing still works at the Smithsonian, in an office that uses an old fossil leaf exhibit display as a coffee table. He adds, “This is how science is supposed to work. We disagreed. We argued. We discussed. We kept each other honest. But we didn’t let the disagreement stay personal, and the result was we each improved what we were doing. We both have enough sense to respect the other’s opinion. That makes it easy to be friends, too.” Archibald, J.D., Wing, S.L. (1991). Comment: “Equable” climates during Earth history? , 19(5):539-540.

        "content": "A blog about monitoring and forecasting El Niño, La Niña, and their regional and global impacts...but sometimes about other climate phenomena that influence seasonal climate. The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA ), with periodic guest contributors. Ideas and explanations found in these posts should be attributed to the ENSO blog team, and not to NOAA (the agency) itself. These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. . While not as popular as “polar vortex,” oceanic Kelvin waves did break into media reports in early 2014 ( , , ) when a really strong wave traveled eastward across the tropical Pacific Ocean. In this post, we’ll go into a little more detail on what these waves are and why they are important in ENSO prediction. And if Kelvin waves ever get as popular as the polar vortex some day, we are confident our readers will be able to describe them in a way that doesn’t generate a heavy from scientists. The waves that most of us are familiar with are the waves at the beach—waves that endlessly curl and crash on the shore. But the ocean and atmosphere also have what are called “planetary waves”—waves of immense scale. Kelvin waves are a kind of planetary wave. Unlike the waves you see at the beach, Kelvin waves do not curl over and then crash. They are more like the waves in your bathtub, which slowly slosh around. They don’t break, but they still have broad peaks and valleys that change the depth of the water (the ocean equivalent is “sea surface height”). The Kelvin waves that are relevant to ENSO only move and (1). Like all planetary waves, the geographic extent of an equatorial Kelvin wave is huge, often stretching over much of the Pacific Ocean (thousands of miles). Equatorial Kelvin waves have two , which can lead to very different changes in subsurface and sea surface temperature (SSTs) in the eastern tropical Pacific: (A) : Normally, winds blow from east to west across the tropical Pacific, which piles up warm water in the western Pacific. A weakening of these winds starts the surface layer of water cascading eastward. The thick warm layer sloshes east, pushing down the as it goes, thus we call this a “downwelling” wave. The thermocline is the boundary between the warmer, near surface mixed layer and colder deeper water (4). Because of this downward push as the wave travels eastward, it is harder for the colder, deeper water to affect the surface so near-surface temperatures are often . This will often (not always) warm the surface temperatures and plant the seeds for an El Niño (5). (B) : After the downwelling part of the wave goes by, we sometimes see a rebound or upwelling where there was once downwelling (6). Here, the colder water at depth upwells and the thermocline comes closer to the surface. We often will see temperatures near or at the surface. You can see both downwelling and upwelling phases in this diagram below, which shows the average temperature of the top 300m of the ocean along the equator (7). When the warm upper layer is thick, this average temperature is warmer, so this kind of diagram is convenient. After it gets started, a Kelvin wave takes 2-3 months to cross the tropical Pacific, which gives us some lead time to anticipate a possible El Niño event. We saw a big downwelling Kelvin wave in March/April 2014 (also see this ), but then we saw an upwelling phase go through in June/July, which helped to reverse and cool temperatures in the eastern Pacific. The subsurface temperature changes are not always perfectly equal and opposite. Just because there is a strong downwelling phase does not mean there will be a strong upwelling phase (6). Equatorial sub-surface temperature anomalies (averaged from 0-300 meters depth) shown for each longitude across the Pacific Ocean (see x-axis). Time is shown on the y-axis from mid-January 2014 (top edge) to mid January 2015 (bottom edge). Red shading shows where temperatures were above-average, and blue shading shows where they were below average. Data is from the NCEP with anomalies defined with respect to the average over 1981-2010. Figure is from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. During December 2014 and January 2015, we saw a weak upwelling Kelvin wave move across the tropical Pacific (white shading), which resulted in cooling of the subsurface tropical Pacific ocean. Will this be the final nail in the coffin for El Niño in winter of 2014-15? It is possible, so stay tuned to future . Going forward, we still need to continue to monitor the Pacific for future downwelling Kelvin waves which may increase the risk of El Niño forming in 2015 (see latest ). (1) At this point, our more inquisitive readers might ask themselves, what happens after this wave hits the coast of South America? Well, they can bounce back (slightly off the equator) as a westward moving . Also, there is a second type of Kelvin wave in the ocean that is not as directly applicable to ENSO prediction, which is called a that travels with the coast to its right in the Northern Hemisphere. (2) At planetary scales, different forces dominate, and so we find these different classes of waves. However, like any wave, planetary waves begin when the surface of a fluid is disturbed somehow. (3) The atmospheric Kelvin wave is often presented as (CCKW) and is essentially similar to the atmospheric Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) except they move faster eastward and span shorter wave lengths (Kiladis et al., 2009). (4) The is often defined by subsurface temperatures at 20°C. Around the 20°C layer, ocean temperatures change rapidly (a strong temperature gradient). On average, the thermocline is found at a deeper depth in the western Pacific and is closer to the surface in the eastern Pacific. (5) The appearance of a downwelling Kelvin wave does not automatically mean an El Niño event is coming. Sub-surface temperatures can get quite warm, but they do not necessarily manifest themselves at the surface of the ocean in a 1:1 fashion. This is because it is “easier” to achieve large anomalies near the thermocline (a large temperature gradient can lead to big anomalies) and not necessarily right at the surface. However, downwelling Kelvin waves are one sign of a possible El Niño and are why it is important to monitor below the surface of the ocean in addition to the surface. (6) There does not have to be a rebound upwelling wave. The waves entirely reflect the wind forcing: if the winds remain westerly, there will be no rebound. But it happens that typically westerly wind forcing (e.g. say from the MJO) is then followed by easterly anomalies. This process is entirely external to the ocean— ultimately, the ocean will respond to sustained wind forcing. (7) Figure 1 is referred to as a , which is an intimidating name, but it is a nice way to present information. The red shading is showing where the subsurface temperatures (from the ocean surface to 300 meters below the surface) are above average. Blues show you where they are below average. The nice thing about this diagram is that you can see the evolution and movement of these waves over time. The upper-left to lower-right tilt of the temperature anomalies indicates which is a sign of an oceanic Kelvin wave. In contrast, you cannot see this movement when you examine a figure simply showing the subsurface ocean temperatures at one point in time (like the one below that is for 13 January 2015). In a Hovmoller diagram, one of the axes (usually the vertical/y-axis) must be time. Depth-longitude section of the equatorial Pacific upper-ocean (0-300m) temperature anomalies centered on the pentad of 13 January 2015. The anomalies are averaged between 5S-5N and are based on departures from the 1981-2010 base period pentad means. Kiladis, G. N., M. C. Wheeler, P. T. Haertel, K. H. Straub, and P. E.

Submitted by on Sat, 04/11/2015 - 02:43 No, the tropical wind anomaly often changes on a quicker time scale than the 2-3 months it takes for the Kelvin wave to cross from western to eastern Pacific Ocean. That means that a spell of westerly wind anomalies may produce a downwelling phase of a Kelvin wave but end long before the wave makes it to the eastern part of the Pacific basin. Another spell of wind anomalies may sometimes occur while tthe Kelvin wave is still traveling eastward. This can trigger two separate Kelvin waves, or, if the wind spells are close together in time, the two spells of westerly wind anomalies may cause a single, but less sharp, downwelling Kelvin wave. The Kelvin waves are somewhat integrative--they may contain the effects of more than one spell of wind anomalies. The heat content of the subsurface waters is yet even more integrative, as it can be a result of more than one Kelvin wave at a time, such as two of them moving eastward but separated by 1000 km, being triggered by separate spells of wind anomaly. In addition to these shorter-lasting wind anomalies, long-lasting ones may come about once an El Nino is in full swing, and the ocean and atmosphere are well coupled. In that case there would be a longer period of steadier westerly wind anomalies due to the El Nino SST pattern, with wind blowing toward the location of maximum SST anomaly, typically in the Nino3 or Nino3.4 region, or even farther west over the dateline (as is the case in the current weak El Nino).

The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA ), with periodic guest contributors. Ideas and explanations found in these posts should be attributed to the ENSO blog team, and not to NOAA (the agency) itself. These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. Reading back over the many excellent (if I do say so myself) posts here at the ENSO blog, there have been several re-occurring themes—the biggest of which is that ENSO is not just an ocean phenomena but an ocean-atmospheric interaction. ENSO is no one-man act. If the ocean is Abbott, then the atmosphere is Costello; the ocean…Laverne, the atmosphere…Shirley; the ocean…Kanye, the atmosphere…Kim. And just like there would be no “Kimye” without Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, there is no ENSO event without both an atmospheric and oceanic response. We have previously touched on both aspects of this with a post on the in the equatorial tropical Pacific Ocean (and the lack of gradient may be currently hindering the development of El Niño) as well as a post on the atmospheric response, , where Emily Becker described the Southern Oscillation, especially the lack of typical response in that Southern Oscillation during June 2014. The focus of Emily’s post was on the Pacific Ocean atmospheric circulation, which we also call the Pacific “overturning cell” of an atmospheric “loop” called the . The lower part of the loop flows east to west across much of the tropics near the surface; the upper part flows west to east at higher altitudes. Rising air in the west and sinking air in the east connect the flow in one big, continuous loop. The post describes how El Niño can affect this Pacific Ocean “overturning cell,” but unlike the popular saying in that desert southwest tourist town, what happens in the Pacific, does just stay in the Pacific. ENSO can affect this atmospheric circulation, the Walker Circulation, over the entire tropics, impacting rainfall near the equator across multiple continents from Africa to Asia to South America! SO (pun intended) what does the entire Walker Circulation look like normally and how is it maintained? Figure 1 shows a simplified version of what the airflow over the equator looks like during the northern hemisphere winter, when ENSO events—El Niño and La Niña—are strongest. During neutral ENSO conditions, upward branches of the Walker Circulation rise strongly across the Maritime Continent and more weakly over eastern Africa and northern South America. These rising branches coincide with bull’s-eyes of precipitation during December through February. In contrast, downward branches of dry, stable air sink strongly over the eastern Pacific Ocean and more weakly over the Arabian Sea. Generalized Walker Circulation (December-February) during ENSO-neutral conditions. Convection associated with rising branches of the Walker Circulation is found over the Maritime continent, northern South America, and eastern Africa. NOAA Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. What creates such a broad, large-scale circulation along the equator? Well, we already sorta went over that , when talking about the importance of a sea surface temperature gradient. Thanks to Earth’s rotation on its axis, trade winds at the equator blow relentlessly from east to west, pushing sea water towards the west side of most ocean basins. The ocean water warms the entire way. The end result is relatively warmer surface water in the west and cooler surface waters in the east. Above this large pool of warm water (known to Earth scientists as the Pacific Warm Pool), air rises; above the cooler water in the east, air dries and settles near the surface. More widespread storminess and rising air motion are associated with a larger warm pool. Temperature contrasts between land and ocean also amplify the circulation (1). From Figure 1, we can see that the strongest upward branch of the Walker Circulation is located over the Maritime Continent, north of Australia. Weaker upward branches occur over less discernible warm pools, like the western Indian Ocean. The relative strength of the rising branch over South America is between those two extremes. The Walker Circulation is basically a thermally (fancy word for temperature) direct circulation that relies on temperature differences to drive the rising and sinking branches. During ENSO events like El Niño and La Niña, this circulation gets either pushed or pulled around (El Niño) or sent into overdrive (La Niña) across the Pacific. We’ve how during El Niño, this warm pool of water usually in the western Pacific Ocean begins to slosh to the east. As this warm pool moves east, the rising branch of the Pacific cell of the Walker Circulation follows, and boy does the rest of the Walker Circulation get shifted around (Figure 2). Generalized Walker Circulation (December-February) anomaly during El Niño events, overlaid on map of average sea surface temperature anomalies. Anomalous ocean warming in the central and eastern Pacific (orange) help to shift a rising branch of the Walker Circulation to east of 180°, while sinking branches shift to over the Maritime continent and northern South America. NOAA Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. Instead of strong rising motion over the Maritime Continent, upward flow weakens, and anomalous sinking motion occurs. The usual rising, moist air over South America is replaced by another anomalous sinking branch. The reversal of the circulation generally means that less rainfall than average dominates in these two areas during El Niño. In contrast, increased rising motion enhances rainfall over the central Pacific Ocean and even parts of equatorial eastern Africa. Meanwhile during La Niña events (Figure 3), when waters in the western Pacific are even warmer than normal and waters in the eastern Pacific are even colder, it is like someone turned the normal Walker Circulation “up to 11”. Warm, moist air rises even more over the Maritime Continent and South America leading to above-average rainfall. In the eastern Pacific, where colder than average waters exist, an enhanced downward branch of the Walker Circulation helps to further reduce the region’s already small rainfall totals. Generalized Walker Circulation (December-February) anomaly during La Niña events, overlaid on map of average sea surface temperature anomalies. Anomalous ocean cooling (blue-green) in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean and warming over the western Pacific Ocean enhance the rising branch of the Walker circulation over the Maritime Continent and the sinking branch over the eastern Pacific Ocean. Enhanced rising motion is also observed over northern South America, while anomalous sinking motion is found over eastern Africa. NOAA Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. So in addition to ENSO impacts outside the , ENSO events literally change the overturning circulation across the entire equatorial region. Of course, these patterns describe idealized or typical cases. As of early July, we were still waiting for the atmosphere to begin to reflect characteristics similar to Figure 2, if it does at all. If the atmosphere gets in gear, plenty of places could see changes in their usual rainfall patterns. But until then, we wait and see, trying to figure out what Mother Nature has up her sleeve. (1) Rising and sinking branches of the Walker Circulation generally occur over land as opposed to the ocean. This is due to a variety of other forcing mechanisms such as land-sea temperature contrasts where land areas warm and cool to a larger degree than the oceans nearby which is one reason why rising and sinking air is focused over land.

These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. Over the last couple of months, we’ve been witnessing a tremendous of one of the strongest El Niño events on record. Sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the east-central equatorial Pacific Ocean have over three degrees Fahrenheit since ! The collapse of El Niño was well predicted because El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are almost always strongest during the Northern Hemisphere winter (1). So, the seeds of destruction are sown into most El Niño events, but what exactly are they? To understand the demise of El Niño, one needs to understand why and how ENSO evolves. The entire ENSO lifecycle describes the birth, growth, maturation, and death of warm (El Niño) and cool (La Niña) phases. When and why ENSO events get their start is still a bit of a mystery to us and is why forecasting remains challenging. The death of ENSO is slightly more predictable, but still not preordained (2). While ENSO events don’t always die in the spring or summer, there are times—like recently!—when it’s clear that a eulogy needs to be written. Remember that one of the best crystal balls for the future state of ENSO is what is happening in the ocean. Relative to the fast-changing atmospheric winds, we can literally see the evolution of ENSO in slow-mo because the ocean is tough to push around. One of the reasons we know the seeds of destruction have been planted is because we can watch them unfolding from below. The and that drift and dive several hundred meters below the surface show us what is happening not just the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean, but what has been happening the surface of the ocean. Recently, there are signs of El Niño’s demise at the surface of the ocean (a strip of emerging), but for months we have been watching the equatorial Pacific cool down well below the surface (usually down to 1,000 feet below the surface). You can see one nifty animation of the subsurface ocean in this recent written by our fabulous editor Rebecca Lindsey (3). Temperature anomalies (departures from normal) across the depth of the equatorial Pacific Ocean (shown from the surface to 300 meters/984 feet below the surface). Red shading shows where temperatures are above average, and blue shading shows where the temperatures are below average. Animation by Climate.gov, based on NCEP GODAS data. But why did this cooling of the subsurface ocean along the equator of the Pacific Ocean occur in the first place? Not so long ago we were witnessing the entire tropical Pacific (surface and subsurface) , with well above-average temperatures. One theory is called the “recharge-discharge” mechanism (4). Hang with me, and I promise I will explain, but not overload you (but if you want to be overloaded go straight to footnote #5). Following La Niña and/or during Neutral conditions, heat builds up in the subsurface ocean around the equator over many months or even years (6). Heat tends to increase initially in the western Pacific Ocean. This is called the “ ” period (akin to recharging a battery!). At some point, this built-up heat in the subsurface ocean becomes large and extensive enough that it begins to influence the surface of the ocean. Generally, there is some trigger that instigates the spread of above-average temperatures across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, such as a strong westerly wind burst (7). occurs when above-average surface temperatures are observed across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. As El Niño matures, the warmer than average waters in the upper layers of the equatorial Pacific Ocean drain away from the equator and toward the off-equatorial regions (8). This is called the “ ” period (9). Why does this discharging occur? Without getting into math that might make your head spin, during El Niño the sea level is higher than average in the central and eastern Pacific, and the winds are anomalously westerly. These conditions are not normal and so an ocean current arises in order to try to bring everything back in balance. This ocean current moves heat away from the equator (“Sverdrup transport” if you want to impress your friends). To the north of the equator, this current moves northward and to the south of the equator, it moves southward. With the near-surface currents pulling water away from the equator, what then happens on the equator? Basically, cooler water from the deeper depths of the ocean moves upward, so it is closer to the surface. Sometimes (not always), the discharging is enough that the equatorial Pacific cools down to the point that a La Niña event occurs, as reflected in below-average temperatures across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. After this the heating cycle starts anew. Go back to What’s neat is that we can see this discharging (step III) occurring in measurements going back several months. The animation below is showing the average of oceanic temperatures from the depth to the surface. Temperature anomalies (departures from normal) averaged from the surface to 300 meters (or 984 feet) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Red shading shows where temperatures are above-average and blue shading shows where the temperatures are below-average. Animation by climate.gov using pentad (5-day) averaged data from . Watch how you can clearly see the disappearance of the above-average ocean temperatures near the equator of the eastern Pacific Ocean (red shading), with the area of elevated temperatures elongating just to the north and south of equator. Eventually, the below-average ocean temperatures (blue shading) dominate along the equator. Another way to track recharge-discharge is in CPC’s , which has a diagram showing this idea in action (the slide is titled “Warm Water Volume and Niño3.4 Anomalies”). Discharge is not always this obvious, but given the tremendous El Niño we just had, it is clearly a big player and now all eyes are on whether it cools down enough that a La Niña gets underway. If you’re a regular reader of this blog, you already know ! (1) In the case of our (ONI), there was one really oddball El Niño episode that maximized during the late summer/early fall in 1987. This El Niño is also unusual because it spanned two consecutive winters (1986-87 and 1987-88). (2) Unlike El Niño, La Niña events in particular have been known to last 1-3 years, so while it might weaken sometimes in the spring, it may not fade away entirely. (3) People read the ENSO blog. Some folks ask how this happened and I’m a little baffled by it myself. This is an unabashedly nerdy blog. But it’s clear to me that this blogging team is top notch, our guest bloggers have been generous about sharing their expertise, and Rebecca is a major reason why it’s not written entirely in Klingon. (4) We’ve already touched on the “delayed oscillator” mechanism on this blog. See two such articles by Tony and . The recharge-discharge and delayed oscillator mechanisms are not mutually exclusive in the real world, so they can both be occurring at the same time. In fact, you can – with math – show that delayed oscillator is a sub-case of recharge-discharge. The biggest difference is that recharge-discharge theory does not explicitly invoke oceanic waves ( and Rossby waves), while delayed oscillator does. Recharge-discharge is more focused on the movement of heat from the equator to off the equator and vice versa, while delayed oscillator is focused more on the zonal (east-west) movement of heat. While we’re not getting into them here, there are a lot of other ENSO mechanisms in the literature as well, but recharge-discharge and delayed oscillator are probably two of the most popular ones. (5) For those who want more technical details please here are some potentially useful references: Wyrkti, 1985: Water displacements in the Pacific and the genesis of El Niño cycles, . 90, 7129-32. Cane & Zebiak, 1985: A Theory For El Niño And The Southern Oscillation, , 228, 1085-7. Jin, F.-F., 1997a: An equatorial ocean recharge paradigm for ENSO. Part I: Conceptual model. . Vol 54 811-829.

Observations of warm water volume changes in the equatorial Pacific and their relationship to El Niño and La Niña. , , 3551-3559. (6) Again, the birth of ENSO events is more of a mystery than its death, which tends to be more foreseeable. Why does heat build up over time? We don’t understand all the details other than this usually occurs after an extended period of ENSO-neutral (normal or average conditions) or La Nina when the trade winds are either near normal or stronger, respectively. The trade winds blow from east-to-west across the tropical Pacific Ocean. What happens in that journey is that the water heats up (from the sun) and then piles up in the western Pacific because it has nowhere else to go. (7) Timing is important too as the average state of the Pacific is more conducive to atmosphere-ocean coupling and growth during the Northern Hemisphere summer and fall. (8) Not all heat that was on the equator is released to the ocean off the equator. Some heat goes into the atmosphere resulting in an increase in global air temperatures. Also, some heat may remain on the equator due to nonlinear processes that don’t cancel out during the El Niño-La Niña cycle – this is referred to as “ENSO rectification on the mean state due to residual nonlinear dynamical heating.” We won’t get into this now ( ), but maybe we’ll get someone to guest post on it sometime. (9) Not only is the heat draining off the equator during the peak of El Niño (usually Northern Hemisphere winter), but as the event progresses into the spring, the average state of the Pacific Ocean becomes less conducive to coupling (less of a normally present east-west SST gradient and weaker Bjerknes feedback, which is something we briefly referred to in this ).

Millions of people rely on the timely seasonal progression of the rains in order to plant crops and feed their families. As seen in the animation above, the seasonal migration of the rains across the continent lead to distinct rainfall seasons in West Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa. An animation shows this pattern easily. But imagine you were trying to explain this pattern to someone and you were only allowed to use a small amount of space on a single printed page. That’s a conundrum scientists face all the time when they are explaining their research. You’d be left with static images to describe an anything but static earth. Because try as we might, we have yet to create artistic technology that mimics the moving pictures found in newspapers and artwork throughout the Harry Potter universe. But have no fear! It’s a tough problem, but someone’s already solved it. In 1949, a scientist by the name of Ernest Hovmöller created a diagram that excels at showing movement in static pictures (Hovmöller 1949). A cross between a map and a graph, the figure is known today as a . Each individual column in this Hovmoller Diagram is one day of rainfall across Africa (20W-55E), averaged by latitude. The columns are arranged chronologically like the books on a shelf. The horizontal axis shows the time of year, and the vertical axis shows how much it rained at each latitude. Animation by Mary Lindsey and Hunter Allen, based on data provided by the Climate Prediction Center. Hovmöller Diagrams average all the values in a single column of longitude or row of latitude and puts those values on one axis. The other axis represents time. In the example above, we are using the horizontal dimension (X axis) to represent and the vertical dimension (Y-axis) to represent . This way, we can show how rain moves north or south over the course of the year. Still a bit confused? The animation below shows how we built our Hovmöller Diagram. In the Hovmöller Diagram, you can still see that the heaviest rains push farthest up (north) along the Y-axis in the northern hemisphere summer (June-August). In contrast, during the southern hemisphere summer (December-February), the opposite occurs. Rains are farther down (south) along the Y-axis. The seasonal cycle of African rainfall is simplified in one tidy figure! While they may pale in comparison to the type of sorcery seen in Harry Potter, Hovmöller Diagrams are excellent at tracking signals that move, like rains in Africa. These diagrams can be used for many more types of atmospheric features. Stay tuned for our next post where we rotate a Hovmöller Diagram by 90° and learn how to use it to learn more about a recent across the Maritime Continent. Hovmöller, E.

ENSO arises from changes across the tropical Pacific Ocean. So why does ENSO affect the climate over sizable portions of the globe, including some regions far removed from the tropical Pacific Ocean? Does the strength of ENSO matter for global impacts? ENSO affects the sea surface temperature (SST) in regions where fishing is a major industry to some countries. A prominent example is the anchovy fishing routinely done off the northwest coast of Peru. When El Niño occurs, the warmed waters become unfavorable for the fish, which flee for cooler waters, resulting in poor harvests that are detrimental to the Peruvian economy. But the abnormal tropical Pacfic SSTs are only the beginning of the story of ENSO’s impacts. When El Niño occurs, the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean becomes warmer than average. With the elevated SST, there is more thunderstorm activity, or convection, than usual over the waters in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. This convection is caused by the increased temperature and moisture in the air right above the warmed water. This warm, moist air rises to form thunderstorm clouds. The process causes in the upper atmosphere: heat from the warmed surface of the ocean is released when water vapor condenses into clouds and rainfall. With more storminess than usual, the upper atmosphere becomes warmer than usual, and this extra heat sets in motion yet another series of important effects. The rising air in the tropical Pacific can branch away from the equator toward the higher latitudes, both northward and southward, contributing to the complex circulation patterns that help establish the average worldwide climate features. This poleward movement of air in the upper atmosphere, sinking motion over the subtropics, and the return flow at lower levels of the atmosphere toward the lower pressure at the equator, is called the (see figure). El Niño influences global atmospheric circulation by intensifying the Hadley circulation, in which heat is transferred from the Earth's surface to the upper atmosphere through convection and latent heating. Map by NOAA Climate.gov. When an El Niño causes excess heating in the tropical Pacific upper atmosphere, the air flow toward the poles becomes more vigorous. The change in the strength of the Hadley circulation leads to modifications in the circulation patterns worldwide, including, for example, the position of the jet stream that flows from west to east over the North Pacific in winter months. El Niño tends to lead to an elongated jet stream that can extend all the way to North America and bring an above-average supply of storms across the southern part of the United States. By strengthening the Hadley circulation, El Niño can trigger a cascade of noticeable departures from the normal rainfall patterns around the globe. The changes in the atmospheric circulation, and subsequent ground-level climate impacts, that stretch across the globe are called El Niño (see figure). Teleconnection patterns emerge in climate simulations, and they show up in historical observations. Typical rainfall patterns during El Niño events. Such teleconnections are during El Niño events, but not . Map by . Observations since 1950 indicate that impacts during El Niño depend on the season. The figure shows what changes, and during which seasons, El Niño is expected to bring about across the globe. It must be emphasized that while these impacts are during El Niño, they are not to occur. The stronger the El Niño, however, the more likely the teleconnection side effects become. There is also some correlation between the strength of the El Niño and the severity of the effects (Lyon and Barnston, 2005), but, again, it must be stressed that there are no guarantees here either. The most reliable effects of El Niño are deficient rainfall over Indonesia and northern South America, and excess rainfall in southeastern South America, eastern equatorial Africa, and the southern US.

These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. As the 2020–21 La Niña has , leaving us with neutral conditions in the tropical Pacific, we now wonder if we have seen the last of La Niña for a while or if we will see another dip into La Niña conditions by next fall. In the world of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), double-dipping is not a party foul—it’s actually quite common for La Niña to occur in consecutive winters (not El Niño, though). If you’re wondering why, then this is the blog post for you! To understand why La Niña commonly double dips, we first need some basic understanding of ENSO . Often, we think of El Niño and La Niña as mirror opposites—for example, that the warmer-than-average east-central tropical Pacific conditions during El Niño are exactly matched by the cooler-than-average conditions of La Niña. This mirror-opposites perspective is a pretty good approximation, but it’s not perfect! Average November – January sea surface temperature anomalies (°C) for the top 10 strongest (top) El Niño and (bottom) La Niña events since 1950 based on the November – January Niño3.4 index. Anomalies are calculated with respect to 30-year base periods updated every 5 years (see for a description). NOAA Climate.gov figure with obtained from the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory. Upon closer inspection, we see some subtle but important differences between El Niño and La Niña in terms of their patterns and behavior. First, the sea surface temperature anomalies (difference from the long-term average) during El Niño tend to be centered farther east than for La Niña, especially for episodes. Second, the strongest El Niños tend to be stronger than the strongest La Niñas. We can see these differences in the maps above. The warm anomalies in the eastern Pacific for the El Niño composite are between 2.25 and 2.75 degrees Celsius (4 and 5 degrees Fahrenheit), while the cool anomalies in the east-central Pacific for the La Niña composite top out at 2.25 degrees C. Monthly sea surface temperature anomalies in the Niño 3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for (top) all first-year El Niño and (bottom) first-year La Niña winters since 1950, starting in the March before the first-year peak. Climate.gov graph based on ERSSTv5 temperature data. We also see notable differences in how in the Niño 3.4 region of the Pacific change over time for first-year El Niños (meaning, the previous winter did not feature El Niño) and first-year La Niñas. After the peak of El Niño, which typically occurs in late fall or winter, Niño3.4 surface temperatures usually decline rapidly to neutral conditions by the following spring. In the ensuing summer through winter, ENSO neutral conditions continue, or La Nina develops, but the occurrence of El Niño in a second consecutive winter is uncommon. For La Niña, in contrast, the return to ENSO neutral after the late fall peak is usually more gradual, and, as Emily , the transition to El Niño after the first winter of La Niña rarely occurs. Instead, we generally see ENSO-neutral or a transition back into La Niña conditions by the following fall, as shown by that second dip in average Niño3.4 temperatures in the plot above. To reiterate what Emily already noted, of the 12 first-year La Niña events , 8 were followed by La Niña the next winter, 2 by neutral, and 2 by El Niño. Things would be simpler if El Niño and La Niña behaved similarly, so why are the transitions out of El Niño and La Niña so different? The answers lie in the processes that cause El Niño and La Niña to strengthen and weaken. Several months ago, Michelle introduced us to the essential processes for ENSO, the fun-to-say . Essentially, Bjerknes feedbacks describe the reinforcing interactions (positive feedbacks) between the ocean and atmosphere that cause El Niño and La Niña to grow: changes in the tropical Pacific ocean temperatures cause changes in the overlying trade winds, which then cause additional, reinforcing changes in the ocean temperature (please see for more of the details!). May–September monthly zonal (east-west direction) wind stress anomalies against the monthly sea surface temperature anomalies in the 3.4 region from 1980-2016. The wind stress anomalies corresponding to La Niña conditions (blue dots) are averaged over the central tropical Pacific from 5°S - 5°N and 167°E - 153°W. The wind stress anomalies corresponding to El Niño conditions (red dots) are averaged farther east, 5°S - 5°N and 179° - 139°W. These regions have the strongest relationship with the Niño 3.4 index and are chosen following . The steeper slope of the linear fit to the red dots relative to the linear fit to the blue dots indicates a stronger zonal wind stress response under El Niño conditions. NOAA Climate.gov figure based on wind stress data and ERRSSTv5 sea surface temperature data. If all essential processes that comprise this feedback process were equal but opposite for El Niño and La Niña, then we might expect mirror opposite patterns. However, this isn’t the case. For example, the response of the trade winds to the Niño3.4 surface temperatures is unequal between warmer and cooler surface conditions. We see this above in the scatter plot of monthly May–September zonal (east-west direction) wind stress anomalies (1) in the equatorial Pacific versus the Niño3.4 surface temperature anomalies. As we expect, warmer Niño3.4 surface temperatures that are tied to El Niño conditions bring weaker trade winds and a weaker (positive wind stress anomalies), whereas cooler Niño3.4 conditions bring stronger trade winds (negative wind stress anomalies) connected with a stronger Walker circulation. However, the plot also reveals that the relationship between the warm (El Niño) and cool (La Niña) sea surface temperature anomalies and the wind anomalies they generate is not equal. El Niño’s warm water anomalies generally produce wind stress anomalies that are stronger and farther east than those produced by cool La Niña anomalies of equal strength. The stronger response is demonstrated by the steeper slope of the red line versus the blue line. This difference may seem a bit subtle, but it can have big consequences for ENSO asymmetry (2). The strength of the coupling between the winds and upper ocean matters because it not only strengthens El Niño and La Niña, but it also sets the wheels in motion for the ultimate demise of each event. The strong coupling between ocean and atmosphere and the more eastward wind stress anomalies during El Niño contributes to a robust , typically by early spring, that ends the El Niño event and sets the stage for the next La Niña. The weaker coupling and more westward wind stress anomalies during La Niña means that the corresponding “recharge” of heat is also weaker, and so the ocean is not as primed for a transition to El Niño. Instead, if we experience the right sequence of tropical weather, a second winter of La Niña may return instead (3). The scenario I have described is far from complete, as there are many other atmospheric and oceanic (and even !) processes that likely contribute to ENSO asymmetry and the tendency for La Niña to persist for more than one winter (4). There is still considerable debate about which processes are most important for these El Niño/La Niña differences (still so much unsettled ENSO science!). Can we predict when La Niña will double-dip? Some recent studies suggest that we may be able to predict (in a ) more than a year in advance the likelihood of two-year La Niña based on the strength of the preceding El Niño and poleward discharge of equatorial heat (5). However, the most recent La Niña is a bit unusual because El Niño did not immediately precede it, and so it is difficult to identify any clear indicators that La Niña will return next fall at this time. Although we must await further guidance to get a better handle on the forecast, we at least can say that both history and the suggest that El Niño is unlikely to return in the near future. (1) Wind stress measures the lateral force per unit area that the wind exerts on the ocean surface. A “positive zonal wind stress anomaly” corresponds to an anomalous eastward force on the ocean surface, exerted by a stronger-than-average eastward component of the winds; this the normally westward force exerted by the trade winds. Conversely, negative zonal wind stress anomalies indicate a westward force on the surface ocean, exerted by stronger-than-average westward trade winds. (2) The zonal wind stress analysis of this post is modeled after . That study provides conceptual and theoretical support for the hypothesis that the asymmetry in zonal wind stress response to tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, like what is shown in the scatter plot of this post, is sufficient for explaining many of the asymmetries between El Niño and La Niña, including the tendency for La Niña to persist for more than one winter (see the next footnote for additional details). Choi, K.-Y., G. A. Vecchi, and A. T. Wittenberg, 2013: ENSO transition, duration, and amplitude asymmetries: Role of the nonlinear wind stress coupling in a conceptual model. , , 9462-9476. (3) For those of you who are interested in more of the scientific details about how this wind stress asymmetry between El Niño and La Niña may contribute to the tendency for La Niña to double-dip, this footnote provides additional, more technical discussion, courtesy of . ENSO events are sparked by a between two coupled ocean/atmosphere time scales in the response to wind changes: a fast equatorial adjustment (oceanic equatorial + ), and a slow off-equatorial adjustment (curl-induced oceanic Rossby waves and delayed negative feedbacks). Equatorial wind anomalies that are located farther east (as during a strong El Niño) induce more transient growth, disequilibrium, and overshoot into the opposite phase, for 2 key reasons. (1) Their resulting zonal current anomalies & upwelling anomalies are located closer to the warm pool edge in the central Pacific and shallow of the east Pacific. This strengthens the transient growth via fast equatorial processes (zonal advective feedback and Ekman feedback, two of the important Bjerknes feedbacks), which amps the wind anomalies so much that they can over-discharge the equatorial thermocline several months later. (2) When the off-equatorial wind stress curl anomalies are located farther east, they’re also farther from the western boundary, and so their resulting off-equatorial oceanic Rossby wave trains have farther/longer to travel before they can reflect back onto the equator and start the turnabout of the ENSO event. This enables the equatorial disequilibrium to grow more strongly before being impeded & eventually reversed by the delayed negative feedback. Thus, the more eastward-shifted zonal wind stress anomalies during strong El Niños enable stronger transient growth & disequilibrium, increasing the over-discharging and subsequent overshoot. In short, under the “zonal wind stress asymmetry hypothesis” of , La Niña is more likely to double-dip because its winds stress anomaly is so from the “sea surface temperature-ticklish” zone of the central/eastern Pacific, and so to the western boundary “transfer station” for the off-equatorial feedbacks, that La Niña just can’t get as much of a disequilibrium going – and hence can’t over-charge the equator enough to guarantee an overshoot into El Niño. (4) For a comprehensive review of existing hypotheses for ENSO asymmetry, I recommend . An, S.-I., E. Tziperman, Y. Okumura, and T. Li, 2020: ENSO irregularity and asymmetry. In A. Santoso, M. McPhaden & W. Cai (Eds.), (pp. 153– 172). John Wiley & Sons. (5) For example, a few recent studies, including two led by suggest that the probability of a multi-year La Niña may be skillfully predicted 18-24 months in advance, given a preceding El Niño. The sources of skill are rooted in the strength of the El Niño and the magnitude of poleward heat discharge 6 months after the peak of El Niño. DiNezio, P. N., C. Deser, Y. M. Okumura, and A.

Submitted by on Mon, 10/11/2021 - 15:31 Here along the west coast, the La Nina'ish teleconnections (not necessarily SSTA's at that point) suggests an atmospheric origin in 2019-20 prior to the oceanic La Nina 2020-21. Since the same anomalous Wx pattern is persisting through 2020-21 (resulting in 2 yrs of record heat and drought), is it possible that 2021 was really the 2nd year of La Nina (weather-wise) and we may now hope for a slow return to more normal conditions in 2021-22? Submitted by on Mon, 10/11/2021 - 15:31 Hi Craig, La Nina isn't the only game in town when it comes to influencing West Coast weather. Sometimes other climate phenomena or just the randomness of our atmosphere can lead to similar weather patterns to La Nina but have nothing to do with the tropical Pacific. In 2019-2020, there was no active La Nina in the Pacific, but that doesn't mean that drought couldn't happen in the West Coast. It's just bad luck that there was a dry year preceding the La Nina which often also leads to drier outcomes for parts of the West Coast.

Submitted by on Sat, 02/19/2022 - 18:19 As I look at through the decades of past episodes of seemingly 4, and not just 3, long-term la Nina episodes of more than 2 years, (especially to include the winter months), I see that they rather robustly occur every 22 years. The correlation is found in every other (odd numbered) solar cycle as upticks flip every 11 year cycle from a northern polarity to a southern polarity and then back again. Meanwhile, every new solar cycle upstart seem to favor a la Nina, which have been declining in episode strength lately. The mid cycle peak of sun spot activity with a lag of hot solar wind favor warmer conditions as they should. The sun is 99.8 of the mass of our solar system and maybe doing more driving than we have known, or at least illuded too. Just like hurricane season lags into the late fall past peak heating, there is likewise a bit of a lag-effect following an uptick in new sun spot activity. The magnetic fields flipping back to \"normal\" every other 22 year clearly have this triple-dip tendency. (give or take a couple of \"neutral\" months seen during 1974 and 2021 triple-dip runs), maybe there is a 44 year bump in this road too, or just the fact that we are headed into another grand solar minimum. Either way, the declining sun spot activity over the last 40 years may also be influencing the weaker tendency of the strength of both warm and cold climate cycles. That's my two Indian cents. #happynativeamericanheritagemonth Submitted by on Thu, 11/10/2022 - 17:31 In reply to by Keep your eyes on our monthly updates posted here (2nd Thursday of each month): Our official probabilities (which are linked at the end of the second paragraph) are here: Right now (and this will update monthly) we are around 35% for the summer and fall.

When the United States released its first Climate Literacy Guide in 2009, I taught an Earth & Environmental Science class at a high school in New York. We were wrapping up our unit on climate change and I spoke with the students about small changes we could make to reduce waste. I asked, \"...So what if we all consumed a little less? What if we shopped less, drove less, and tried to alter our daily habits just a little?\" A student of mine spoke up in a steady and certain voice. \"Miss,\" she said, “I think I speak on behalf of the whole class when I say that if I had to stop shopping, I would want to die.\" A handful of my students’ eyes widened in shock similar to mine, but most of the class agreed emphatically with their classmate. Fresh into my teaching career, I still had a lot to learn, but from that classroom exchange, one thing I realized was that shifting the mindset of students in my classroom, especially on a social norm that valued consumerism over environmentalism, was a challenge with context and nuance far beyond my classroom walls. I knew that I needed to adjust my teaching style and learn as much as I could about both and . As an instructor, I first moved towards overhauling my own mindset and misconceptions before I could address pedagogy. My mentor , a leader in , guided me to learn more about deliberative discussion, connecting to my students’ personal lives, and how to incorporate predominantly hands-on, project-based learning into my classroom unit plans. This included researching the cradle-to-grave journey of name-brand clothing, using maps to explore students’ communities and ways in which they could experience nature close to home, and facilitating discussions around collective, community actions instead of focusing solely on individual ones. Ultimately, I radically changed my perspective around urban education and changed the whole structure of my teaching style. I also committed to leaning harder into the science. I used the to ground lesson plans in research-informed findings on carbon cycles, sustainability, and biodiversity. I even had the “ posted on the walls around my classroom. Almost two decades later, both my personal career and the have come a long way. I earned a degree in science education while in New York, then went on to earn a degree in environmental sciences and engineering with a focus on climate, and a subsequent degree focused on environmental education. Eventually I moved on from formal classroom teaching and took a position within the Integrated Climate Sciences Division in EPA’s Office of Research and Development. The advances climate-focused initiatives that address urgent climate priorities expressed by EPA program, regional, state, and Tribal partners. My work in the division is still education-based, as I am currently working on developing and executing the , an environmental education workshop series for residents in a community that is consistently exposed to significant flooding. I also joined the Writing Team for the . Being an author of this , a document that guided my early career and life decisions, has been a true full-circle moment for me. Similarly to my personal and professional advancements since 2009, the latest version of the Climate Literacy Guide reflects advancements in the science – including physical and social sciences – with updates that incorporate Indigenous Knowledges, social and cultural contexts, the social sciences, climate solutions, and climate justice concepts. I hope another teacher (maybe even a new teacher like I was!) might discover the updated Climate Literacy Guide and find it helpful. Although I felt like I had significant room to improve on my teaching style after that exchange with my former student, you can imagine my surprise when, the following year, she sought me out in the hallways to proudly tell me that she had put herself on a \"shopping budget.\" Needless to say, teachers have immense power to make an impact, no matter where they are in their own journey, and I hope this updated Climate Literacy Guide might be one more resource to help those important impacts take shape.

You might be surprised to learn that tens of millions of Americans rely on private wells for their drinking water. My grandfather's home in rural East Texas highlights a critical issue: The house, built over a century ago, likely contains lead components in its plumbing, specifically, pipes and fixtures that deliver water to the faucet. Lead exposure can largely go unnoticed until significant health issues arise, like hearing problems, slowed growth, anemia, among others. Water quality from private wells is not regulated by the EPA but may be regulated by state or local authorities. As an intern in the at the EPA, I have learned about the serious health risks that lead exposure poses to children. I am particularly concerned about how many families lack awareness about the importance of testing well water, now that I know its quality is not federally regulated. Many people often assume that clear water is safe to drink. However, harmful contaminants may be present without visible signs. Lead can be present in drinking water without any noticeable changes in color or odor. It is the responsibility of private well owners to test their water for lead and to take appropriate measures to mitigate exposure. Understanding the risks associated with lead in drinking water is crucial, especially when considering its impact on children's health. There is no safe level of lead. Lead exposure is harmful at any age, but it poses a greater risk to young children, infants, and fetuses. The physical and behavioral effects of lead occur at lower exposure levels in children than in adults. A dose of lead that might have minimal effect on an adult can have significant consequences for a child. Lead poisoning can lead to both physical and behavioral issues, and these impacts can be long-lasting or even permanent. The health impacts of lead can vary significantly depending on the stage of life during which exposure occurs. Children can be exposed to lead from various sources in addition to private wells, including contaminated water from old pipes, playing in contaminated soil, inhaling dust from deteriorating paint, consuming food stored in lead-glazed pottery, and playing with toys containing lead. This widespread exposure underscores the urgent need for vigilance and prevention efforts to protect children's health and development. Children are especially at risk because they frequently put their hands and objects in their mouths, which can transfer lead from contaminated surfaces directly into their bodies. If you believe your child may have been exposed to lead, it is important to have them tested with a Health impacts of lead on children include: In rare cases, high ingestion of lead can cause seizures, coma, and even death. Private well owners are responsible for delivering safe drinking water to their households. Testing is important because lead does not affect the taste, odor, or color of the water. The internal plumbing of a home may have old pipes, solders, and fixtures that are made with lead. Similarly, older homes may have well pumps or well casings with lead-containing parts. Naturally acidic or low-mineral content groundwater can corrode lead-containing materials and cause the lead to leach into the water. Homeowners with private wells should test their drinking water more frequently if they have children, elderly family members, or someone pregnant or nursing living at home. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that through blood and breastfeeding mothers can expose their infants through breastmilk. For more recommendations on testing your water, visit EPA's website. Under the , the EPA is responsible for setting and enforcing standards for safe lead levels in public water systems. The EPA assigned a (MCLG) of zero for lead in drinking water due to its toxicity even at low levels. EPA has set required treatment techniques (referred to as the that regulate corrosivity of water because lead contamination is often due to corrosive water and its contact with lead pipes. The recent Lead and Copper Rule Improvement requires the replacement of lead pipes within ten years and more rigorous testing of drinking water. In private wells, these techniques are not required. EPA estimates that over 23 million households across the United States rely on private well water for drinking. There is no requirement for monitoring lead or other contaminants in , as they are not federally regulated, and most states have limited regulations on private drinking water wells. Accordingly, it is important that households with private wells regularly test the quality of their drinking water. EPA has a that can help determine if you have lead plumbing. All you need is a penny (or key) and a magnet. If you have a confirmed lead pipe, you should contact your water company or a licensed plumber for confirmation and replacement options. If you determine you have a lead pipe: As we observe throughout October, it is crucial to take proactive steps to ensure the safety of our drinking water. Testing your private well for lead is an essential measure to protect the health of children in your home. If left untested, lead contamination in private wells can remain undetected, posing serious health risks, particularly to young children. I encourage you to initiate conversations with family and friends who rely on private wells, emphasizing the importance of regular testing for lead. Together, we can create a greater awareness and commitment to protecting children's health.

The collection and treatment of domestic sewage and wastewater is vital to public health and clean water. It is among the most important factors responsible for the general level of good health enjoyed in the United States. Sewers collect sewage and wastewater from homes, businesses, and industries and deliver it to wastewater treatment facilities before it is discharged to water bodies or land, or reused. NPDES permits establish discharge limits and conditions for discharges from municipal wastewater treatment facilities to waters of the United States. Resources for discharge requirements include: Historically, municipalities have used two major types of sewer systems. Combined sewers are designed to collect both sanitary sewage and stormwater runoff in a single-pipe system. These systems were designed to convey sewage and wastewater to a treatment plant during dry weather. Under wet weather conditions, these combined sewer systems would overflow during wet weather conditions when large amounts of stormwater would enter the system. State and local authorities generally have not allowed the construction of new combined sewers since the first half of the 20th century. The other major type of domestic sewer design is sanitary sewers (also known as separate sanitary sewers). Sanitary sewers are installed to collect wastewater only and do not provide widespread drainage for the large amounts of runoff from precipitation events. Sanitary sewers are typically built with some allowance for higher flows that occur when excess water enters the collection system during storm events. Sanitary sewers that are not watertight due to cracks, faulty seals, and/or improper connections can receive large amounts of infiltration and inflow (I/I) during wet weather. Large volumes of I/I can cause sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and/or operational problems at the wastewater treatment facility serving the collection system. In addition, sewage overflows can be caused by other problems such as blockages, equipment failures, broken pipes, or vandalism. Resources for overflows and peak flows at treatment plants include: Significant increases in flow at wastewater treatment facilities caused by wet weather conditions can create operational challenges and potentially adversely affect treatment efficiency, reliability, and control of unit process operations at the treatment facility. The CSO policy encourages municipalities with combined sewers to maximize wet weather flows to the treatment plant in order to decrease uncontrolled overflows in the collection system. Resources for peak flows at wastewater treatment facilities include:"

EPA has released the fifth edition of its Climate Change Indicators in the United States Report. Dive in to see updated data, learn about connections, and review two brand new indicators to the collection. Temperatures are rising, snow and rainfall patterns are shifting, and more extreme climate events – like heavy rainstorms and record high temperatures – are becoming more common. Many of these observed climate changes are linked to rising levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, caused by human activities. EPA’s indicators provide evidence of these changes and their impacts on people and the environment. EPA partners with dozens of data contributors to compile and keep these indicators up to date. Check out more than 50 indicators that show the causes and effects of climate change. Explore the data with maps and figures. Follow along with detailed narratives and supporting data about specific effects of climate change. Learn about how EPA develops indicators, find answers to frequent questions, and access publications. As the concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continue to increase, the United States has experienced warming temperatures, more unusually hot summer days, and more frequent heat waves that threaten people’s health and strain the electric power grid. . Rising global average temperature is associated with widespread changes in weather patterns. Extreme events such as heavy rainstorms, hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires have happened throughout history, but human-induced climate change is expected to make these events more frequent and/or intense. . The heat-trapping greenhouse gases that humans have added to the atmosphere are making the Earth’s oceans warmer and more acidic. Changes in the oceans affect the Earth’s climate and weather patterns and threaten marine ecosystems and biodiversity and the people whose livelihoods depend on them. . Like most of the Arctic, Alaska is warming more quickly than the rest of the world. The state is also uniquely vulnerable to climate change due to its frozen features, such as widespread permafrost and sea ice.

There is no safe level of lead. Lead can be present in drinking water without any noticeable changes in color or odor. It is the responsibility of private well owners to test their water for lead and to take appropriate measures to mitigate exposure. Early in my career I realized that shifting the mindset of students in my classroom, especially on a social norm that valued consumerism over environmentalism, was a challenge with context and nuance far beyond my classroom walls. Years spent observing various cultures threaded through multiple languages gave me my biggest gift; I can absorb a person’s voice into my pen and onto their paper.

Water quality trading is a market-based approach that states, tribes, and territories may wish to pursue as an effective means to attain water quality improvements. Water quality trading is an approach to control pollutants from multiple sources that collectively impact water quality conditions. When more stringent regulatory standards are put in place, water quality trading allows one source of pollution to control a pollutant at levels greater than required and sell \"credits\" to another source, which uses the credits to supplement their level of treatment in order to comply with regulatory requirements. Pollutant reductions achieved through water quality trading must result in water quality that is as good as—or better than—what would be achieved through treatment and must not create pollutant “hot spots.” Water quality trading can encourage private investment capital, provide additional resources for conservation, and serve as a catalyst for developing innovative, practical solutions for improving water quality at a lower cost. Water quality trading has had a critical role in implementing TMDLs and other water quality-based NPDES permit requirements. For example, many municipal wastewater treatment plants across the country are seeing more stringent nutrient limits in their permits. Traditionally, those facilities would have to pay for new treatment technologies at the plant to meet the new limits. Water quality trading can allow facilities subject to strict requirements to purchase nutrient reductions from other treatment plants, farms, or other nutrient sources to achieve the same or better water quality outcome at a lower cost. Water quality trading can provide greater flexibility on the timing and level of technology a facility might install, reduce overall compliance costs, and encourage voluntary participation of nonpoint sources within the watershed. Nonpoint source projects (e.g., streamside buffers, conservation tillage) installed as part of a water quality trade can provide other environmental benefits, such as reducing carbon emissions, reducing flood potential, stabilizing streambanks and providing wildlife habitat."

Partnership is an umbrella term that is defined as any informal or formal relationship or agreement that two or more water systems engage in to overcome similar challenges through solutions that are beneficial for all. This can encompass a range of opportunities for water systems to work together to sustainably provide water services, from sharing equipment to transferring ownership of a system through consolidation. Water System Partnerships are a cross-program, problem solving tool for building TMF capacity and addressing unique challenges, especially those of small systems. In addition to improving a system's capacity, partnerships can also help improve regulatory compliance and public health by providing safe, reliable, affordable, and accessible drinking water. Finding and building support is essential for a partnership to be successful. This allows for trust to be built between the water system, key stakeholders, and the communities served. Support for water system partnerships can be split into three categories: – Identifies beneficial partners and partnerships. – Provides retrospective lessons learned. - Find materials to help implement partnerships including Getting Started Guide, Funding Resources document, Compendium of State Policies and Programs, and more."

EPA partners with more than 50 data contributors from various government agencies, academic institutions, and other U.S and international organizations to compile a key set of indicators related to the causes and effects of climate change. Explore the questions and answers below to learn more about the indicators. One important way to track and communicate the causes and effects of climate change is through the use of indicators. An indicator represents the state or trend of certain environmental or societal conditions over a given area and a specified period of time. EPA's indicators are designed to help readers understand observed long-term trends related to the causes and effects of climate change. In other words, they provide important evidence of \"what climate change looks like.\" For example, long-term measurements of are used as an indicator to track and better understand the effects of changes in the Earth's climate. EPA compiles these indicators with the primary goal of informing our understanding of climate change. They are designed so that the public, scientists, analysts, decision-makers, educators, and others can use climate change indicators as a basis for: EPA publishes these indicators to make them accessible and available to use in a variety of ways. These indicators characterize observed changes from long-term records related to the causes and effects of climate change; the significance of these changes; and their possible consequences for people, the environment, and society. The indicators presented here do not cover all possible measures of the causes and effects of climate change, nor do they capture all possible climate change indicators found in the full body of scientific assessment literature. Instead, these indicators represent a wide-ranging set of high-quality, long-term data that show observed changes in the Earth’s climate system and several climate-relevant impacts. Together, these indicators present compelling evidence that climate change is happening now in the United States and globally. All of the indicators on this website relate to either the causes or the effects of climate change. Some indicators show trends that can be more directly linked to human-induced climate change than others. Collectively, the trends depicted in these indicators provide important evidence of \"what climate change looks like.\" Although each indicator has a connection to climate change, EPA's indicators do not attempt to identify either the extent to which a certain indicator is driving climate change, or the relative role of climate change in causing a trend in an observed indicator. Connections between human activities, climate change, and observed indicators are explored in more detail elsewhere in the scientific literature. For example, see the U.S. Global Change Research Program's . Some indicators are directly linked to human activities that cause climate change, such as . Changes depicted by other indicators, like , have been confidently linked with the increase in greenhouse gases caused by human activity. Some of the trends in other indicators, such as , are consistent with what one would expect in a warming climate but may also be influenced by limitations in the historical data or other factors in addition to climate change. A few indicators, like , though known to be influenced by climate change, do not yet show any significant trend. In some cases, this could be because the period for which data are available or the geographic scale in which they are presented is limited. EPA partners with more than 50 data contributors from various U.S. and international government agencies, academic institutions, and other organizations to compile and communicate key indicators related to the causes and effects of climate change. EPA's indicators consist of peer-reviewed, publicly available data. In addition to being published on EPA's website, these data sets have been published in the scientific literature and in government and academic reports. Details on each underlying data set as well as where to find it are provided in the technical documentation on . Trends relevant to climate change are best viewed at broad geographic scales and over long time periods. EPA's indicators are based on historical records that go back in time as far as possible without sacrificing data quality, so each indicator's time scale varies. Most of EPA's indicators focus on the United States. However, some include global trends to provide context or a basis for comparison, or because they are intrinsically global in nature, such as . EPA attempts to present multiple scales (national, regional, or location-specific) in cases where the underlying data allow such scaling. The geographic extent and timeframe of each indicator largely depend on data availability and the nature of what is being measured. EPA also includes features such as “Community Connection” and “A Closer Look” (e.g., ) that focus on a particular region or localized area of interest to engage readers in particular areas or topics of interest within the United States. While the features and their underlying data are not national in scale or representative of broad geographic areas, these features are screened, developed, and documented in a manner consistent with other indicators. Although the climate is continually changing, not every climate change indicator shows a pattern of steady change over the period of record. The Earth is a complex system, and there are always natural variations from one year to the next—for example, a very warm year followed by a colder year. The Earth’s climate also goes through other natural cycles that play out over a period of several years or even decades. Individual years or even individual decades can deviate from the long-term trend. Human factors may also influence a trend—for example, human activities and land management practices can affect wildfire activity from year to year. EPA’s greenhouse-gas-related indicators focus on most of the major, well-mixed greenhouse gases that contribute to the vast majority of warming of the climate when they are emitted into the atmosphere. These major gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. Some of these gases are produced almost entirely by human activities, while others come from a combination of natural sources and human activities. Many of these major greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for tens to thousands of years after being released. They become globally mixed in the lower part of the atmosphere, called the troposphere (the first several miles above the Earth’s surface), reflecting the combined emissions worldwide from the past and present. Due to this global mixing, concentrations of these gases are fairly similar no matter where in the world they are measured. Other substances that have much shorter atmospheric lifetimes (i.e., less than a year) are still relevant to climate change. Important short-lived substances that affect the climate include water vapor, ozone in the troposphere, pollutants that lead to ozone formation, and aerosols (atmospheric particles) such as black carbon and sulfates. Water vapor, tropospheric ozone, and black carbon contribute to warming, while other aerosols produce a cooling effect. In addition to several long-lived greenhouse gases, EPA's indicator tracks concentrations of ozone in the layers of the Earth's atmosphere, while Figure 2 of the indicator shows the influence of a variety of short-lived substances. Indicators provide key information on changes that are occurring in our environment, like increasing temperatures or more severe extreme weather events, which can threaten people's health. Tracking changes in climate impacts and exposures improves understanding of changes in health risk, even if the actual health outcome is difficult to quantify. For example, while only some indicators exist for human health outcomes related to climate change, like , , , and , other indicators—like , , or —give insight into the changing risks to human health. There are many factors other than climate that affect human health; these are discussed in more detail in EPA's overview of . EPA's climate change indicators are grouped into six categories: Each indicator can be accessed through the links above or directly from the page. Within each indicator, you will see: EPA recommends the following citation for this resource and for individual indicators: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

EPA has published several summary reports of , starting in 2010, then in 2012, 2014, 2016, and most recently, 2024. The online resource is updated periodically as new data become available, and thus may differ from the most recent reports and content. EPA's indicators are an example of a well-established, nationally relevant set of indicators representative of data from several of the federal agencies participating in the . EPA works closely with several of these agencies (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Geological Survey, and U.S. Department of Agriculture) and serves as a co-chair of . EPA’s climate indicators are leveraged as scientific input to the federal interagency effort. EPA will continue to work in partnership with coordinating bodies such as the USGCRP and with other agencies, organizations, and individuals to collect and communicate useful data and to inform policies and programs based on this knowledge. For example, EPA collaborated with the U.S. Forest Service to develop a showing indicators that help the user explore the causes and effects of climate change."

Modernizing electricity delivery can help grid operators better understand and respond to how power is flowing across transmission and distribution lines. These new capabilities are enabled by incorporating information and communications technologies across a variety of new and existing controls, sensors, and software systems. Modern grid, or smart grid, investments can enable grid operators to respond faster to changes in grid conditions and allow for two-way communication between utilities and electricity end-users. The U.S. Department of Energy maintains additional background on its website. Electricity delivery systems have traditionally been built with a goal of providing economic, reliable electricity service and expanding to meet new or growing demand for electricity consumption. While meeting these goals, modern electricity delivery systems can also be planned and managed to provide additional benefits, such as . How the electricity delivery system is designed, operated, and managed is critical to achieving economic, reliability, and environmental benefits with a modern grid. Modern electricity delivery technologies may increase the energy efficiency of the overall electricity system by reducing energy losses along transmission and distribution lines and delivering higher quality electricity to industry, businesses, and homes. Electricity usage data from smart meters may be used to support other energy efficiency efforts and reduce consumption. Modernizing electricity delivery may also enable greater integration of renewable energy resources through changes to how grid operators manage and deploy resources such as storage or demand response during periods when renewable resources wane (e.g., when solar production decreases due to cloud cover). Integrating renewable energy resources can provide environmental benefits by avoiding the adverse environmental effects from other . The environmental benefits of modernizing electricity delivery are expected to outweigh the negative effects. Possible environmental concerns include: Advanced (“smart”) meters transmit data using radio-frequency waves, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation. However, the radiation given off by a smart meter is similar in type and strength to the radiation from other common consumer devices. ."

The electric power grid operates based on a delicate balance between supply (generation) and demand (consumer use). One way to help balance fluctuations in electricity supply and demand is to store electricity during periods of relatively high production and low demand, then release it back to the electric power grid during periods of lower production or higher demand. In some cases, storage may provide economic, reliability, and environmental benefits. Depending on the extent to which it is deployed, electricity storage could help the utility grid operate more efficiently, reduce the likelihood of brownouts during peak demand, and allow for more renewable resources to be built and used. Energy can be stored in a variety of ways, including: In addition to these technologies, new technologies are currently under development, such as flow batteries, supercapacitors, and superconducting magnetic energy storage. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the United States had more than 25 gigawatts of electrical energy storage capacity as of March 2018. Of that total, 94 percent was in the form of pumped hydroelectric storage, and most of that pumped hydroelectric capacity was installed in the 1970s. The six percent of other storage capacity is in the form of battery, thermal storage, compressed air, and flywheel, as shown in the following graph: Storing electricity can provide indirect environmental benefits. For example, electricity storage can be used to help integrate more renewable energy into the electricity grid. Electricity storage can also help generation facilities operate at optimal levels, and reduce use of less efficient generating units that would otherwise run only at peak times. Further, the added capacity provided by electricity storage can delay or avoid the need to build additional power plants or transmission and distribution infrastructure. Potential negative impacts of electricity storage will depend on the type and efficiency of storage technology. For example, batteries use raw materials such as lithium and lead, and they can present environmental hazards if they are not disposed of or recycled properly. In addition, some electricity is wasted during the storage process."

Below are answers to some frequently asked questions about climate change. For information about evidence of climate change, the greenhouse effect, and the human role in climate change, please see . On this page: \"Weather\" refers to the day-to-day state of the atmosphere such as the combination of temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, and other factors. \"Climate\" describes the weather of a place averaged over a period of time, often 30 years. Think about it this way: climate is something that can be expected to happen in general, like a cold winter season, whereas weather is what a person might experience on any given day, like a snowstorm in January or a sunny day in July. Climate change involves significant changes in average conditions—such as temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other aspects of climate—that occur over years, decades, centuries, or longer. Climate change involves longer-term trends, such as shifts toward warmer, wetter, or drier conditions. These trends can be caused by natural variability in climate over time, as well as that add to the atmosphere like burning fossil fuels for energy. The terms \"global warming\" and \"climate change\" are sometimes used interchangeably, but global warming is just one of the ways in which climate is affected by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. \"Global warming\" describes the recent near the earth's surface, which is caused mostly by (such as carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere from such as burning fossil fuels for energy. Climate change occurs over a long period of time, typically over decades or longer. In contrast, climate variability includes changes that occur within shorter timeframes, such as a month, season, or year. Climate variability explains the natural variability within the system. For example, one unusually cold or wet year followed by an unusually warm or dry year would not be considered a sign of climate change. Even though the planet is warming, some areas may be experiencing extra cold or snowy winters. These cold spells are due to variability in local weather patterns, which sometimes lead to colder-than-average seasons or even colder-than-average years at the local or regional level. In fact, a warmer climate traps more water vapor in the air, which may lead to in some areas. As long as it is still cold enough to snow, a warming climate can lead to bigger snowstorms. Yes. Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that people are contributing significantly to today’s climate change, primarily by releasing excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy, cultivating crops, raising livestock, and clearing forests. The , which represents the work of hundreds of leading experts in climate science, that \"it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.” The , developed by the U.S. Global Change Research Program—which is composed of 13 federal scientific agencies—concluded that scientific evidence consistently points to human activities, rather than natural climate trends, as the “dominant cause” behind the rapid global temperature increase of 1.8°F from 1901 to 2016 (see Figure 1). Hundreds of independent and governmental scientific organizations have released similar statements, both in the United States and worldwide, including the , the , and the . The earth does go through natural cycles of warming and cooling caused by such as changes in the sun or volcanic activity. For example, there were times in the distant past when the earth was warmer than it is now. However, natural variations in climate do not explain today’s climate change. has been caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases that come from a variety of activities, including burning fossil fuels. A degree or two change in average global temperature might not sound like much to worry about, but relatively small changes in the earth’s average temperature can mean in local and regional climate, creating risks to , , , , and . Among the many examples cited by the are an increase in heat waves and days with temperatures above 90°F; more extreme weather events such as storms, droughts, and floods; and a projected sea level rise of 1 to 4 feet by the end of this century, which could put certain areas of the country underwater. Climate change poses many threats to people’s health and well-being. Among the health impacts cited by the are the following: See EPA’s website for more information about the effects of climate change in the United States. Everyone will be affected by climate change, but some people may be more affected than others. Among the most vulnerable people are those in overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed communities. Three key factors influence a person’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change: In addition, there is a wide range of other factors that influence people’s vulnerability. For example, people with less access to healthcare, adequate housing, and financial resources are less likely to rebound from climate disasters. People who are excluded from planning processes, experience racial and ethnic discrimination, or have language barriers are also more vulnerable to and less able to prepare for and avoid the risks of climate change. . People can reduce the risks of climate change by that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and by preparing for the changes expected in the future. Decisions that people make today will shape the world for decades and even centuries to come. Communities can also prepare for the changes in the decades ahead by identifying and reducing their vulnerabilities and . Such actions can ensure that the —such as young children, older adults, and people living in poverty—are protected from the health and safety threats of climate change. The longer people wait to act on climate change, the more damaging its effects will become on the planet and people’s health. If people fail to take action soon, more drastic and costly measures to prevent greenhouse gases from exceeding dangerous levels could be needed later. The most recent found that global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could avoid tens of thousands of deaths per year in the United States by the end of the century, as well as billions of dollars in damages related to water shortages, wildfires, agricultural losses, flooding, and other impacts. There are many that people can take now to help reduce the risk of climate change while also improving the natural environment, community infrastructure and transportation systems, and overall health."

Since the Industrial Revolution, have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other into the atmosphere, which has changed the earth’s climate. Natural processes, such as changes in the sun's energy and volcanic eruptions, also affect the earth's climate. However, they do not explain the warming that we have observed over the last century. Scientists have pieced together a record of the earth’s climate by analyzing a number of indirect measures of climate, such as ice cores, tree rings, glacier lengths, pollen remains, and ocean sediments, and by studying changes in the earth’s orbit around the sun. This record shows that the climate varies naturally over a wide range of time scales, but this variability does not explain the observed warming since the 1950s. Rather, it is extremely likely (> 95%) that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming. It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Human activities have contributed substantially to climate change through: Concentrations of the have all increased since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are now more abundant in the earth’s atmosphere than any time in the last 800,000 years. These greenhouse gas emissions have increased the and . Burning fossil fuels changes the climate more than any other human activity. In recent years, human activities have released around 35 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. have increased by more than 40 percent since pre-industrial times, from approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) in the 18th century to 419 ppm in 2023. Human activities increased methane concentrations during most of the 20th century to more than 2.5 times the pre-industrial level, from approximately 722 parts per billion (ppb) in the 18th century to 1,922 ppb in 2023. Nitrous oxide concentrations have risen approximately 20 percent since the start of the Industrial Revolution, with a relatively rapid increase toward the end of the 20th century. Nitrous oxide concentrations have increased from a pre-industrial level of 270 ppb to 337 ppb in 2023. Activities such as agriculture, road construction, and deforestation can change the reflectivity of the earth's surface, leading to local warming or cooling. This effect is observed in , which are urban centers that are warmer than the surrounding, less populated areas. One reason that these areas are warmer is that buildings, pavement, and roofs tend to reflect less sunlight than natural surfaces. While deforestation can increase the earth’s reflectivity globally by replacing dark trees with lighter surfaces such as crops, the net effect of all land-use changes appears to be a small cooling. Emissions of small particles, known as aerosols, into the air can also lead to reflection or absorption of the sun's energy. Many types of air pollutants undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere to create aerosols. Overall, human-generated aerosols have a net cooling effect on the earth. Learn more about human-generated and natural . Natural processes are always influencing the earth’s climate and can explain climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s. However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone. Changes in the earth’s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet’s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures. At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11°F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2°F warmer than it is today. Changes in the sun’s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth’s surface. While these changes can influence the earth’s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades. Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun’s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen. The amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth’s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed. Natural changes in the earth’s surface, like the , have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as to other processes. Volcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO ) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years. These particles are an example of cooling . Volcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year. Over the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower. The heating or cooling of the earth’s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. These changing concentrations have acted as a positive , amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth’s orbit."

Learn about some of the key concepts related to climate change: The earth's climate is changing. Multiple lines of evidence show changes in our weather, oceans, and ecosystems, such as: These changes are due to a buildup of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and the warming of the planet due to the greenhouse effect. The earth's temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving the planet’s system. When sunlight reaches the earth’s surface, it can either be reflected back into space or absorbed by the earth. Incoming energy that is absorbed by the earth warms the planet. Once absorbed, the planet releases some of the energy back into the atmosphere as heat (also called infrared radiation). Solar energy that is reflected back to space does not warm the earth. Certain gases in the atmosphere absorb energy, slowing or preventing the loss of heat to space. Those gases are known as “greenhouse gases.” They act like a blanket, making the earth warmer than it would otherwise be. This process, commonly known as the “greenhouse effect,” is natural and necessary to support life. However, the recent buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities has changed the earth's climate and resulted in dangerous effects to human health and welfare and to ecosystems. Most of the has been caused by human . Greenhouse gases come from a variety of , including burning fossil fuels for heat and energy, clearing forests, fertilizing crops, storing waste in landfills, raising livestock, and producing some kinds of industrial products. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to recent climate change. Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels, solid waste, trees, and other biological materials, and as a result of certain chemical reactions, such as cement manufacturing. Carbon dioxide is absorbed and emitted naturally as part of the carbon cycle, through plant and animal respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange. The carbon cycle is the process by which carbon continually moves from the atmosphere to the earth and then back to the atmosphere. On the earth, carbon is stored in rocks, sediments, the ocean, and in living organisms. Carbon is released back into the atmosphere when plants and animals die, as well as when fires burn, volcanoes erupt, and fossil fuels (such as coal, natural gas, and oil) are combusted. The carbon cycle ensures there is a balanced concentration of carbon in the different reservoirs on the planet. But a change in the amount of carbon in one reservoir affects all the others. Today, people are disturbing the carbon cycle by burning fossil fuels, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and through land use changes that remove plants, which absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Both natural and human activities produce methane. For example, natural wetlands, agricultural activities, and fossil fuel extraction and transport all emit methane. Nitrous oxide is produced mainly through agricultural activities and natural biological processes. Fossil fuel burning and industrial processes also create nitrous oxide. Chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride, together called , are often used in coolants, foaming agents, fire extinguishers, solvents, pesticides, and aerosol propellants. Different greenhouse gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. In addition, some gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer. Learn more about , a measure of climate impacts based on how long each greenhouse gas remains in the atmosphere and how strongly it absorbs energy. is created by a chemical reaction between emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from automobiles, power plants, and other industrial and commercial sources in the presence of sunlight. In addition to trapping heat, ground-level ozone is a pollutant that can cause respiratory health problems and damage crops and ecosystems. Water vapor is another greenhouse gas and plays a key role in because of its heat-trapping ability. Warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air. Therefore, as greenhouse gas concentrations increase and global temperatures rise, the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere also increases, further amplifying the warming effect. For more information on greenhouse gases, see . Aerosols in the atmosphere can affect climate. Aerosols are microscopic (solid or liquid) particles that are so small that instead of quickly falling to the surface like larger particles, they remain suspended in the air for days to weeks. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and biomass, contribute to emissions of these substances, although some aerosols also come from natural sources such as volcanoes and marine plankton. Unlike greenhouse gases, the climate effects of aerosols vary depending on what they are made of and where they are emitted. Depending on their color and other factors, aerosols can either absorb or reflect sunlight. Aerosols that reflect sunlight, such as particles from volcanic eruptions or sulfur emissions from burning coal, have a cooling effect. Those that absorb sunlight, such as black carbon (a part of soot), have a warming effect. Not only can black carbon directly absorb incoming and reflected sunlight, but it can also absorb infrared radiation. Black carbon can also be deposited on snow and ice, darkening the surface and thereby increasing the snow's absorption of sunlight and accelerating melt. For more information, see the . While reductions in all aerosols can lead to more warming, targeted reductions in black carbon emissions can reduce global warming. Warming and cooling aerosols can also interact with clouds, changing their ability to form and dissipate, as well as their reflectivity and precipitation rates. Clouds can contribute both to cooling, by reflecting sunlight, and warming, by trapping outgoing heat. Climate feedbacks are natural processes that respond to global warming by offsetting or further increasing change in the climate system. Feedbacks that offset the change in climate are called negative feedbacks. Feedbacks that amplify changes are called positive feedbacks. appears to cause the most important positive feedback. As the earth warms, the rate of evaporation and the amount of water vapor in the air both increase. Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this leads to further warming. The melting of Arctic is another example of a positive climate feedback. As temperatures rise, sea ice retreats. The loss of ice exposes the underlying sea surface, which is darker and absorbs more sunlight than ice, increasing the total amount of warming. Less during warm winters has a similar effect. can have both warming and cooling effects on climate. They cool the planet by reflecting sunlight during the day, and they warm the planet by slowing the escape of heat to space (this is most apparent at night, as cloudy nights are usually warmer than clear nights). Climate change can lead to changes in the coverage, altitude, and reflectivity of clouds. These changes can then either amplify (positive feedback) or dampen (negative feedback) the original change. The net effect of these changes is likely an amplifying, or positive, feedback due mainly to increasing altitude of high clouds in the tropics, which makes them better able to trap heat, and reductions in coverage of lower-level clouds in the mid-latitudes, which reduces the amount of sunlight they reflect. The magnitude of this feedback is uncertain due to the complex nature of cloud/climate interactions."

The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter 1972, also called the London Convention, and the 1996 London Protocol are international treaties that provide an international standard and framework for countries to individually and collectively protect and preserve our oceans from pollution caused by the dumping of wastes and other matter into the ocean. Effective implementation of the London Convention and London Protocol helps preserve biological diversity and contributes to higher productivity of ocean resources and improved fisheries. Healthy coastal and ocean environments support tourism, recreation and commerce. Successful treaty implementation also promotes better waste management strategies to prioritize re-use and recycling and foster innovations to reduce waste generation and thus the need for waste disposal. In the United States, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) implements the requirements of the London Convention. On this page: From the 1950s to 1970s, the United States and other countries became increasingly concerned about the environmental impacts of human activities on the marine environment, including the uncontrolled disposal of wastes into the ocean. The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter of 1972, known as the London Convention, is one of the first international agreements for the protection of the marine environment from human activities. The London Convention addresses the deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms and other man-made structures at sea, as well as to the deliberate disposal at sea of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures themselves. Contracting Parties to the London Convention agreed to control dumping by implementing regulatory programs to assess the need for, and the potential impact of, dumping. The London Convention requires that Contracting Parties issue a permit for the dumping of wastes and other matter at sea and generally prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials. Over time, Contracting Parties to the London Convention have amended the treaty by banning ocean dumping of certain wastes and by promoting pollution prevention and better waste management. The London Convention entered into force on August 30, 1975. As of September 2024, there are 87 Contracting Parties to the London Convention. The United States is a Contracting Party to the London Convention. The United States ratified the London Convention on April 29, 1974. The London Convention entered into force on August 30, 1975. In 1996, Contracting Parties to the London Convention concluded negotiations toward a new, free-standing treaty, referred to as the London Protocol, to modernize and eventually replace the London Convention. The London Protocol entered into force in 2006. As of September 2024, there are 54 Contracting Parties to the London Protocol. The United States is not a Contracting Party. The London Protocol is intended to be more comprehensive in protecting the marine environment than the London Convention. Both define dumping to include the deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms, and other man-made structures at sea, as well as deliberate disposal at sea of those objects. The London Protocol definition includes any storage of wastes or other matter in the seabed and the subsoil, as well as the abandonment of structures at sea and any abandonment or toppling at sea of platforms or other man-made structures at sea, for the sole purpose of deliberate disposal. Under the London Protocol, dumping of all wastes and other materials is prohibited except the following materials listed in Annex I of the London Protocol (“the reverse list”), which may be considered for dumping: The United States is not a Contracting Party to the London Protocol. The United States signed the London Protocol in 1998 but has not ratified the treaty. Though the United States has not yet ratified the London Protocol, the United States already implements most provisions of the London Protocol through the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act. Through the London Convention and London Protocol, the United States works with many others to reduce and prevent pollution caused by ocean dumping. Great progress has been made towards the protection of the marine environment due to the active participation of Contracting Parties and their willingness to work together to solve problems related to the control of waste disposal into the ocean. The United States actively participates in the annual Consultative Meeting of Contracting Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol. Among other things, the United States’ participation includes: The Department of State leads the United States delegation to the annual Consultative Meeting and is supported by the EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Navy (Navy), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Department of Energy (DOE), and Department of Interior (DOI). The United States is also an active participant in the annual joint meetings of the London Convention Scientific Group and London Protocol Scientific Group. The Scientific Groups are responsible for providing scientific and technical advice on ocean dumping and marine pollution to the Consultative Meeting. The EPA leads the United States delegation and is supported by the State Department, USACE, NOAA, Navy, USCG, DOE and DOI. As a historical leader in ocean science, the United States’ participation in the science groups helps assure that treaty implementation is guided by the sound science supported by the United States’ scientific expertise. London Convention and London Protocol Contracting Parties are required to submit an annual Ocean Dumping Report to the Secretariat for the London Convention and London Protocol at the (IMO). The IMO is a United Nations specialized agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution from ships The EPA and USACE together develop and submit the annual report for the United States which describes the types and amounts of materials permitted under the MPRSA, permit compliance monitoring, and ocean site monitoring. Contracting Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol have developed international guidance (or guidelines) to assist national authorities responsible for regulating ocean dumping in meeting their treaty obligations. The guidelines contain step-by-step procedures to evaluate wastes and other matter being considered for ocean dumping, including waste prevention audits, assessment of alternatives to ocean dumping, waste characterization, assessment of potential adverse environmental effects of dumping, disposal site selection, and monitoring and permitting procedures. Specific guidelines exist for the assessment of the materials listed in Annex I of the London Protocol. This is available on the IMO website, and the publications can be obtained from . The London Convention and London Protocol prohibit the dumping of wastes with more than levels of radioactivity. Contracting Parties to the London Convention have developed guidance for evaluating materials to determine if they contain levels of radionuclides. In addition, Contracting Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol have developed guidances for monitoring, for the selection and management of ocean sites for the disposal of materials, for sampling and analysis of dredged material, to assist countries with limited experience in regulating ocean dumping, and to share best practices in protecting the marine environment. London Convention and London Protocol Contracting Parties have also developed advice for: Contracting Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol have taken steps to address potential harm to the marine environment from novel technologies designed to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or mitigate its adverse effects. Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol have been working to address sub-seabed sequestration of carbon dioxide, which is a climate change mitigation technique that stores carbon dioxide in geologic formations under the ocean floor. The process involves capturing carbon dioxide from industrial and energy-related sources, transporting that carbon dioxide offshore, and sequestering the carbon dioxide into an appropriate sub-seabed formation. The aim is to store the carbon dioxide within these geological formations permanently in order to mitigate the warming effects from excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The risks of carbon dioxide leaking out of the geologic formation should be minimized to avoid any potential impacts to human health or the marine environment. In 2006, Contracting Parties to the London Protocol adopted amendments to regulate the sequestration of carbon dioxide in sub-seabed geological formations under the treaty. Contracting Parties have developed guidance to address the risks posed by carbon dioxide sequestration in sub-seabed geological formations and potential effects on the marine environment. In 2009, London Protocol Contracting Parties adopted an amendment to allow the export of carbon dioxide streams for sequestration of carbon dioxide in sub-seabed geological formations provided that an agreement or arrangement has been entered into by the countries concerned (Resolution LP.3(4)). The amendment has not entered into force. In 2019, London Protocol Contracting Parties adopted Resolution LP.5(14), agreeing to allow provisional application of the 2009 amendment pending its entry into force. Since 2007, the Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol have been working to establish a global, transparent, and effective regulatory mechanism for ocean fertilization and other marine geoengineering activities that fall within the scope of the London Convention and London Protocol. Learn more about ocean fertilization, other marine geoengineering techniques, and U.S. permitting of certain marine geoengineering activities for and under the MPRSA. In 2023, the Scientific Groups of the London Convention and London Protocol determined that the four marine geoengineering techniques under evaluation have the potential to cause deleterious effects that are widespread, long-lasting, or severe. The Scientific Groups agreed that they should continue to monitor this topic and carry out further work to enable the London Convention and Protocol Parties to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions, including potential further regulation. The Scientific Groups also convened a “Science Day” symposium focused on emerging technologies in marine geoengineering. on the International Maritime Organization website. At the 2023 Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol, the Parties issued a that: 1) reiterated concern about marine engineering techniques, which have the potential for deleterious effects that are widespread, long-lasting, or severe, 2) noted the need to carefully assess potential marine geoengineering activities, and 3) urged that, given risks and uncertainties, marine geoengineering activities other than legitimate scientific research, should be deferred. More information on the London Convention and London Protocol work related to marine geoengineering is provided on the International Maritime Organization website: Mariners or other persons who observe dumping incidents in ocean waters that could be violations of the London Convention and Protocol are encouraged to report these events as follows: Additional information and resources about the London Convention and London Protocol are available through the 's website."

Know what precautions to take when using foggers or misters to apply pesticides, sanitizers, disinfectants, or other chemicals indoors. You can’t see or smell carbon monoxide, but at high levels it can kill a person in minutes. Carbon monoxide (CO) is produced whenever any the following fuels are burned: If appliances that burn fuel are maintained and used properly, the amount of CO produced is usually not hazardous. However, if appliances are not working properly or are used incorrectly, dangerous levels of CO can result. Hundreds of people die accidentally every year from CO poisoning caused by malfunctioning or improperly used fuel-burning appliances. Even more die from CO produced by idling cars. Fetuses, infants, elderly people and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be especially susceptible. Be safe. Practice the DO’s and DON’Ts of carbon monoxide. The Carbon Monoxide fact sheet has also been translated into Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean. This fact sheet contains basic information on flood cleanup with illustrations and links to more detailed information (PDF) Written for general audiences, this fact sheet provides accurate information regarding the use of ozone-generating devices in indoor occupied spaces. This information is based on the most credible scientific evidence currently available. Whether in its pure form or mixed with other chemicals, ozone can be harmful to health. Available scientific evidence shows that, at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is generally ineffective in controlling indoor air pollution. The public is advised to use proven methods proven to be both safe and effective to reduce pollutant concentrations, which include controlling pollutant sources and increasing outdoor air ventilation.

The information provided here is based on current scientific and technical understanding of the issues presented. Following the advice given will not necessarily provide complete protection in all situations or against all health hazards that may be caused by indoor air pollution. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. . Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate. It is particularly important to take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants — for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or engaging in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might also choose to do some of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather permits. Advanced designs of new homes are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). Ventilation and shading can help control indoor temperatures. Ventilation also helps remove or dilute indoor airborne pollutants coming from indoor sources. This reduces the level of contaminants and improves indoor air quality (IAQ). Carefully evaluate using ventilation to reduce indoor air pollutants where there may be outdoor sources of pollutants, such as smoke or refuse, nearby. The introduction of outdoor air is one important factor in promoting good air quality. Air may enter a home in several different ways, including: Infiltration occurs in all homes to some extent. Natural ventilation describes air movement through open windows and doors. If used properly natural ventilation can at times help moderate the indoor air temperature, which may become too hot in homes without air-conditioning systems or when power outages or brownouts limit or make the use of air conditioning impossible. Natural ventilation can also improve indoor air quality by reducing pollutants that are indoors. Examples of natural ventilation are: Most residential forced air-heating systems and air-conditioning systems do not bring outdoor air into the house mechanically, and infiltration and natural ventilation are relied upon to bring outdoor air into the home. Advanced designs for new homes are starting to add a mechanical feature that brings outdoor air into the home through the HVAC system. Some of these designs include energy efficient heat recovery ventilators to mitigate the cost of cooling and heating this air during the summer and winter. There are many types and sizes of air cleaners on the market, ranging from relatively inexpensive table-top models to sophisticated and expensive whole-house systems. Some air cleaners are highly effective at particle removal, while others, including most table-top models, are much less so. Air cleaners are generally not designed to remove gaseous pollutants. A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions. Another important factor in determining the effectiveness of an air cleaner is the strength of the pollutant source. Table-top air cleaners, in particular, may not remove satisfactory amounts of pollutants from strong nearby sources. People with a sensitivity to particular sources may find that air cleaners are helpful only in conjunction with concerted efforts to remove the source. Over the past few years, there has been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants remove significant quantities of pollutants in homes and offices. Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered because overly damp soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals. At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain because they only partially remove the radon decay products and do not diminish the amount of radon entering the home. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a reliable means of reducing the health risk from radon."

Simply scan the QR codes to access the resources. . During a wildfire, smoke can make the outdoor air unhealthy to breathe. Local officials may advise you to stay indoors during a smoke event. You should be aware that some of the smoke from outdoors can enter your home and make it unhealthy to breathe indoor air, too. If you are close to a wildfire, the fire itself, as well as heavy smoke and ash, can pose serious, immediate risks to your safety and health. You and your family should be prepared to evacuate immediately if told to do so. Farther from a wildfire, you may be exposed to smoke even if the fire itself is far away. Smoke is made up of a complex mixture of gases and fine particles produced when wood and other organic materials burn. The biggest health threat from smoke is from fine particles. These microscopic particles can get into your eyes and respiratory system – whether you are outdoors or indoors, where they can cause health problems such as burning eyes, runny nose, and illnesses such as bronchitis. Fine particles also can aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases - and even are linked to premature deaths in people with these conditions. If you are healthy, you're usually not at a major risk from short-term exposures to smoke. Still, it's a good idea to avoid breathing smoke – both outdoors and indoors – if you can help it. Learn more about the . This page provides helpful information to reduce your exposure to wildfire smoke inside your home. Outdoor air, including fine particles from wildfire smoke, can enter your home in a few ways: Wildfire smoke could impact your indoor air quality (IAQ) differently depending on the proximity of the fire and the density of the smoke. Here are some situations you might experience and the actions you can take in each situation: It may be best to evacuate. Fires can spread quickly, and the smoke plume can make it difficult to see in an evacuation. In addition, it can be nearly impossible to keep dense smoke from building up in the indoor air. Pay close attention to local emergency alerts to know when to evacuate. Smoke may enter your home, making it harder to breathe. Learn more about in this situation and for it. If there is an active fire in your area, follow your local news, EPA's website, or your state air quality website for up-to-date information. While this can happen, the amount of smoke that may reach your community from such a distance is probably very small and may be overshadowed by local sources of particle pollution. In this situation, you can monitor your local outdoor air quality on and as you normally would. If you live in an area where the wildfire risk is high, take steps now to prepare for fire season. Being prepared for fire season is especially important for the health of children, older adults, and people with heart or lung disease. The fact sheet describes the key steps you should take to make sure you are prepared to protect your family’s health in the event of a wildfire. provides additional detail on how to protect yourself and your property.

If portable air cleaners are not available or affordable, you may choose to use a . DIY air cleaners are made by attaching a furnace filter to a box fan with tape, brackets, or a bungee cord, and can serve as a temporary alternative to commercial air cleaners. At this time, there is limited data available on how well DIY air cleaners filter smoke particles. . There are many ways to put together a DIY air cleaner. Some common designs are to place one filter flat against the fan, two filters taped with cardboard to form a triangle against the fan, or even more filters taped against the fan to form a cube. The Washington Department of Ecology and Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation have posted tutorial videos to help users construct DIY air cleaners: and . To maximize filtration, choose a high-efficiency filter, preferably rated Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) 13 or higher, and align the arrows on the filter with the direction of the air flow through the fan. Try to get a good seal between the fan and the filter. If you use a DIY air cleaner, follow these safety tips: If you decide to purchase a to increase filtration, choose one with a MERV 13 rating, or as high a rating as your system fan and filter slot can accommodate. You may need to consult a professional HVAC technician to determine the highest efficiency filter that will work best for your system. You can find additional information about portable air cleaners and HVAC filters in the fact sheet and . EPA is also conducting ; the study webpage provides more information about this filtration option. It’s also a good idea to get familiar with your HVAC system or air conditioner system, if you have one, so you can adjust it to keep smoke out. You should also consider keeping a supply of N95 respirator masks on hand. You can often purchase these masks in hardware stores or drugstores. The fact sheet and will help you choose the correct mask and wear it effectively. When wildfires create smoky conditions, there are things you can do, indoors and out, to reduce your family's exposure to smoke. Reducing exposure to smoke is important for everyone’s health — especially children, older adults, and people with heart or lung disease. The fact sheet describes what you can do. If local officials advise you to stay indoors, take these actions in your home to reduce your smoke exposure: After the smoke clears, you may need to clean up ash or other debris left behind by the fire. The fact sheet describes how you can protect yourself and your family and avoid getting ash in the indoor air while cleaning up. Children, older adults, and people with heart or lung diseases, such as asthma, should not participate in cleanup work. Cleanup work can expose you to ash and other products of the fire that may irritate your eyes, nose, or skin and cause coughing and other health effects. Wear gloves, long-sleeved shirts, long pants, shoes and socks to avoid skin contact with ash. Wear an N95 respirator to protect your lungs from breathing in ash. Change your shoes and clothing before you leave the cleanup site to avoid tracking ash offsite, into your car, or other places. To avoid tracking ash into clean indoor spaces, use doormats and clean them regularly. Remove shoes indoors when possible. Ash deposited on surfaces both indoors and outdoors can be inhaled if it becomes airborne when you clean up. Avoid stirring up or sifting through ash as much as you can. Avoid actions that kick ash particles up into the air, such as dry sweeping. Before sweeping indoor and outdoor hard surfaces, mist them with water to keep dust down. Follow with wet mopping. Use a damp cloth or wet mop on lightly dusted areas. When you wet down ash, use as little water as you can. If you choose to vacuum dusty surfaces, use a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-type vacuum. You may consider having your air ducts cleaned after a fire, but EPA recommends that air ducts only be cleaned as needed. For example, you should consider having the ducts cleaned if you find that your ducts are clogged with excessive amounts of dust and debris and/or particles are actually released into your home from the supply registers. For more information on air duct cleaning, including choosing a service provider, see Coco and his friends experience an air quality adventure. Read how Coco, his little sister and his friends solve a mystery as they learn about how wildfires can affect air quality and health.

Spread of COVID-19 occurs via airborne particles and droplets. People who are infected with COVID can release particles and droplets of respiratory fluids that contain the SARS CoV-2 virus into the air when they exhale (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing). The droplets or aerosol particles vary across a wide range of sizes – from visible to microscopic. Once infectious droplets and particles are exhaled, they move outward from the person (the source). These droplets carry the virus and transmit infection. Indoors, the very fine droplets and particles will continue to spread through the air in the room or space and can accumulate. Since COVID-19 is transmitted through contact with respiratory fluids carrying the infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus, a person can be exposed by an infected person coughing or speaking near them. They can also be exposed by inhaling aerosol particles that are spreading away from the infected person. Transmission of COVID-19 from inhalation of virus in the air can occur at distances greater than six feet. Particles from an infected person can move throughout an entire room or indoor space. The particles can also linger in the air after a person has left the room – they can remain airborne for hours in some cases. Someone can also be exposed via splashes and sprays of respiratory fluids directly onto their mucous membranes. Spread may also sometimes occur through contact with contaminated surfaces, though this route is now considered less likely. See or ​ for technical information. Though the risk of infection by breathing in particles carrying the virus generally decreases with distance from infected people and with time, some circumstances increase the risk of infection: There are straightforward steps that can be taken to reduce the potential for airborne transmission of COVID-19 and the focus of this material is on those measures. The layout and design of a building, as well as occupancy and type of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, can all impact potential airborne spread of the virus. The is a call to action and a set of guiding principles and best practices to assist building owners and operators with reducing risks from airborne viruses and other contaminants indoors. Although improvements to ventilation and air cleaning cannot on their own eliminate the risk of airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, EPA recommends increasing ventilation with outdoor air and air filtration as important components of a larger strategy that may include physical distancing, wearing face coverings or masks, , handwashing, and other precautions.

If you have precious items that you want to preserve, a restoration specialist for that type of item may be able to clean and dry it. Be sure to watch these videos to ensure you are safely sorting and discarding items and building materials: Find short how-to videos and other resources on and for more information about how to clean objects and surfaces after a flood. Use cleaning methods that keep contaminants from getting into the air. Avoid stirring up dust or scrubbing surfaces. The first time you clean a surface, clean it gently to remove loose dirt and microorganisms. Use a cloth (or something similar) dampened with clean water and detergent. After you have gently cleaned with something damp, you can use dry tools, like a wet/dry vacuum, to remove any remaining debris. While cleaning, open doors and windows, if possible, to increase ventilation and help dry your home. If you can already see mold, wait to start up fans or dehumidifiers until after you’ve gently cleaned the mold you can see. This is so the fans do not spread the mold. If you suspect that any part of your heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system was submerged or affected by the flood waters, see First, you should use clean water and detergent to physically remove contaminants from surfaces. You can also use an EPA-registered on some clean surfaces that do not absorb water to kill microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, and mold. It is important to understand that disinfectants and sanitizers should be used on surfaces that are clean. These products do not work on surfaces that have not been cleaned. Many of these products are not intended for use on surfaces that absorb water like fabrics or unfinished wood. Some disinfectants, sanitizers, and other cleaning products may cause breathing problems or skin irritation. Before you use a product, , and follow all the directions. Some key directions to look for include: together or add bleach to other chemicals. Mixing cleaning products can create toxic vapors. Before you use bleach or any other disinfectant or sanitizer, you need to thoroughly clean the surface with clean water and a detergent. Water and detergent, as well as the wiping action of a damp cloth or sponge, can effectively remove many microorganisms and debris from surfaces. If you use a disinfectant or sanitizer, such as bleach, you should only use it you have thoroughly cleaned everything that was wet with flood water. Bleach and other disinfectants and sanitizers can kill microorganisms, but they don’t work well unless the dirt around the microorganisms is cleaned up first. such as ammonia or chemicals brought in by contaminated flood water, because the combination can be toxic. If you aren’t sure what chemicals are in the flood water, clean as much as you can with water and detergent before using other products. It is important to prevent unnecessary exposure to both microorganisms (such as viruses, bacteria, and mold) and cleaning products during flood cleanup. Flood water can bring microorganisms, including from sewage and other sources, inside buildings. It can also allow microorganisms that were already inside to grow. During flood cleanup, exposure to these microorganisms can cause allergic or irritant effects, or in some cases even infectious diseases. Cleaning products may also trigger asthma symptoms or have irritant effects if they are not used or stored properly. Many unintentional exposures to bleaches and disinfectants are reported to poison control centers every year. If you have concerns about how flood cleanup work may affect your health, talk to your health care provider before you begin. Learn more about . Find short how-to videos and other resources on . If it is safe to do so, leave outside doors and windows open to keep air moving through the house as you clean and dry it out. Open inside doors and cabinets, and remove drawers, shelves, and built-in furniture (such as cabinets) to allow hidden surfaces to dry. If you have power, you can set up fans, dehumidifiers, or heaters throughout the house to speed up the drying process. However, it's a good idea to wait to start up fans or dehumidifiers until after you’ve gently cleaned all the mold you can see at least once. If the air outside is very humid and warm, it can slow down the drying process. If you have power, consider closing outside doors and windows and use fans, dehumidifiers, air conditioners and/or heaters to dry out the house. If any part of your HVAC system was affected by the flood, use it to help dry out your house. Cleaning and drying your HVAC system can be complicated, so it is best to have a professional do it. If the air ducts in your HVAC system have become contaminated, the EPA document provides information about choosing an air duct cleaning service provider. If your HVAC system is working and is not contaminated, it may help with the drying process. However, you will likely need to use fans, dehumidifiers, and/or heaters, too. Most HVAC systems cannot dry out a home by themselves when the humidity is very high after a flood. Drying can take a long time, usually several days to weeks. Even after things look dry, you should keep the air moving with open doors and windows and any equipment you have available. Do not seal any areas, such as wall cavities, that were flooded and do not apply paint or sealants to any surfaces that were wet until you are sure the materials are completely dry on the inside. A moisture meter can help you determine whether materials such as walls, cabinets, and flooring are dry and ready for refinishing. You can usually find a moisture meter at a hardware store. Use the moisture meter to measure the moisture content of materials. Materials should read 15% or less to be ready for refinishing. To prevent mold growth, you should be sure your foundation is dry before you replace the flooring. An easy way to check if your concrete slab is dry enough to replace the flooring is: Watch the video to see how to do this test.

After a generates electricity, the electricity must be delivered to the end-user. This delivery happens in three steps: Utilities and other grid operators work together to generate and deliver electricity where and when it is needed. For the most part, electricity needs to be generated when it will be used. These needs fluctuate depending on the day, the time, and the weather. The graph below shows variations in the amount of electricity that customers used per hour over a typical week in the summer and a typical week in the winter. Generation capacity availability can also fluctuate. For example, the amount of sunlight that can be captured by solar photovoltaic panels and converted to electricity depends on the weather (sunny or cloudy) and the angle of incoming sunlight (which depends on the season and time of day). Utilities and grid operators need to ensure that enough power will be generated to meet demand when it is high. Baseload power plants generate electricity in most hours of the year and often cannot be turned off or restarted easily. If consumers demand more electricity than baseload power plants can provide, operators respond by increasing production from centralized generation facilities that are already operating at a lower level or on standby, importing electricity from distant sources, or calling on end-users who agreed to consume less electricity from the grid through demand response programs. Improving the ability to balance electricity demand and supply is one reason investments are being made in and . In the second half of the 20th century, utilities began to interconnect their transmission systems to distribute electricity over longer distances from larger, more centralized power plants. This system has grown to include thousands of miles of transmission lines and millions of miles of distribution lines. While a single utility might build and maintain transmission and distribution lines, these lines are often shared by several utilities and electricity retailers. In some areas, regional organizations known as independent system operators (ISOs) or regional transmission organizations (RTOs), made up of utilities and federal and state regulators, coordinate transmission and distribution across their region. In areas without an established ISO or RTO, delivery systems are operated by individual utilities. To learn more about ISOs and RTOs, . While the most significant environmental impacts of electricity relate to how it is generated, electricity delivery can also affect the environment in several ways: Many high-voltage circuit breakers, switches, and other pieces of equipment used in the transmission and distribution system are insulated with sulfur hexafluoride, which is a potent greenhouse gas. This gas can leak into the atmosphere from aging equipment or during maintenance and servicing."

Residential, commercial, and industrial customers each account for roughly one-third of the nation’s electricity use. The transportation sector accounts for a small fraction of electricity use, though this fraction could increase as electric vehicles become more widespread. All types of end-users can reduce electricity use through . The residential sector includes single-family homes and multi-family housing, and it accounts for more than a third of the electricity used nationwide. As the graph shows, on average, the biggest single uses of electricity in the residential sector are space heating and cooling (air conditioning), lighting, water heating, space heating, and appliances and electronics. Electricity demand in the residential sector tends to be highest on hot summer afternoons due to increased air conditioning use, followed by evenings, when lights are turned on. The commercial sector includes government facilities, service-providing facilities and equipment, and other public and private organizations. This sector accounts for more than a third of U.S. electricity consumption. As the graph shows, on average, the biggest single uses of electricity in the commercial sector are lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Electricity demand in the commercial sector tends to be highest during operating business hours; it decreases substantially on nights and weekends. Industrial customers’ facilities and equipment use electricity for processing, producing, or assembling goods, including such diverse industries as manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and construction. Overall, this sector uses less than a third of the nation’s electricity. Data on specific end-uses are available from a broad nationwide survey of manufacturing facilities, which found that more than half of the electricity used in manufacturing goes to powering various motors (machine drive). Other sizable uses include heating, cooling, and electro-chemical processes in which electricity is used to cause a chemical transformation (for example, the processes that produce aluminum metal and chlorine). Electricity use in the industrial sector tends not to fluctuate through the day or year as in the residential and commercial sectors, particularly at manufacturing facilities that operate around-the-clock. The transportation sector consumes most of its energy by directly burning fossil fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. However, some vehicles use electricity from the electric power grid instead. These vehicles include battery-powered electric cars and plug-in hybrid electric cars that store power from the grid when they charge their batteries; various types of electric vans, trucks, and buses that do the same; and subway, electric rail, and trolley systems that are continuously connected to the electric power grid. Transportation activities account for less than 1 percent of total U.S. electricity use, but this percentage could grow as electric vehicles become more common. These vehicles can potentially even feed power back into the grid when demand from other sectors is high, which means the vehicles’ batteries are providing storage capacity for the grid."

When connected to the electric utility’s lower voltage distribution lines, distributed generation can help support delivery of clean, reliable power to additional customers and reduce electricity losses along transmission and distribution lines. In the residential sector, common distributed generation systems include: In the commercial and industrial sectors, distributed generation can include resources such as: The use of distributed generation units in the United States has increased for a variety of reasons, including: Distributed generation systems are subject to a different mix of local, state, and federal policies, regulations, and markets compared with centralized generation. As policies and incentives vary widely from one place to another, the financial attractiveness of a distributed generation project also varies. As electric utilities integrate information and communications technologies to , there may be opportunities to reliably and cost-effectively increase the use of distributed generation. Distributed generation can benefit the environment if its use reduces the amount of electricity that must be generated at centralized power plants, in turn can reduce the . Specifically: However, distributed generation can also lead to negative environmental impacts: Distributed energy technologies may cause some negative environmental issues at the end of their useful life when they are replaced or removed."

EPA ensures the scientific integrity of the climate change indicators through a rigorous development process, as described below. For every indicator, EPA also develops technical documentation that describes the data sources and analytical methods used. Access the technical documentation on . On this page: Identification of candidate indicators is a function of the criteria used to evaluate them as well as the need to transparently document the underlying data and methods. EPA screens and selects each indicator using a standard set of criteria that consider data availability and quality, transparency of the analytical methods, and the indicator’s relevance to climate change. This process ensures that all indicators selected are consistently evaluated, are based on credible data, and can be transparently documented. EPA considers candidate indicators through coordinated outreach, stakeholder engagement, and reviewing the latest scientific literature. Key considerations for new indicators include: 1) filling gaps in the existing indicator set in an attempt to be more comprehensive; 2) newly available, or in some cases improved, data sources that have been peer-reviewed and are publicly available from government agencies, academic institutions, and other organizations; 3) analytical development of indicators resulting from existing partnerships and collaborative efforts within and external to EPA (e.g., development of streamflow metrics in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey for the benefit of the partner agencies as well as key programs within EPA’s Office of Water); and 4) indicators that communicate key aspects of climate change and that are understandable to various audiences, including the general public. EPA chooses indicators that meet a set of 10 criteria that consider data quality, transparency of analytical methods, and relevance to climate change. Based on the availability of these data, some indicators present a single measure or variable while others have multiple measures, reflecting different data sources or different ways to group, characterize, or zoom in on the data. The criteria EPA uses to select indicators are: EPA researches, screens, and selects indicators based on an objective, transparent process that considers the scientific integrity of each candidate indicator, the availability of data, and the value of including the candidate indicator. EPA conducts the screening process in two stages. As an initial screen, each candidate indicator is evaluated against five of to assess whether or not it is reasonable to further evaluate and screen the indicator. These “Tier 1” criteria include peer-review status of the data, feasibility to construct, usefulness, understandability to the public, and connection to climate change. Indicators that reasonably meet these criteria are researched further; indicators that do not meet these criteria are eliminated from consideration. Some of the candidate indicators ruled out at this stage include ideas that could be viable indicators in the future (e.g., indicators that do not yet have published data or need further investigation into methods). Indicators deemed appropriate for additional screening are assessed against the Tier 2 criteria: transparency, reproducibility, and objectivity, broad geographic range, actual observations, trends over time, and uncertainty. Based on the findings from the complete set of 10 criteria, the indicators are again evaluated based on the assessment of the remaining criteria. The distinction between Tier 1 and Tier 2 criteria is not intended to suggest that one group is necessarily more important than the other. Rather, EPA determined that a reasonable approach was to consider which criteria must be met before proceeding further and to narrow the list of indicator candidates before the remaining criteria were applied Based on the results of the screening process, the most promising indicators are developed into proposed indicator summaries. EPA consults the published literature, subject matter experts, and online databases to obtain data for each of these indicators. Upon acquiring sound data and technical documentation, EPA prepares a set of possible graphics for each indicator, along with a summary table that describes the proposed metric(s), data sources, limitations, and other relevant information. Summary information is reviewed by EPA technical staff, and then the indicator concepts that meet the screening criteria are formally approved to begin development. Graphics, summary text, and technical documentation for all proposed new or revised indicators are developed in accordance with the format established for the original 24 indicators in the 2010 indicator report. An additional priority for development is to make sure that each indicator communicates effectively to a non-technical audience without misrepresenting the underlying data and source(s) of information. Regional features (e.g., Community Connections) are developed in the same manner. The complete indicator packages (graphics, summary text, and technical documentation) undergo EPA internal review, data provider/collaborator review, and an independent peer review. Indicators are reviewed at various stages of development by EPA technical staff and various levels of management within the Agency. Organizations and individuals who collected and/or compiled the data (e.g., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey) review the relevant indicators. EPA also enlists technical experts to assist in review of new indicators or revisions. Each new indicator also undergoes independent peer review by subject-matter experts external to EPA. EPA’s indicator compilation reports (i.e., the 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 print editions) have also gone through independent external peer review. EPA follows the procedures in EPA’s (the most recent edition is the fourth, EPA/100/B-15/001) for reports that do not provide influential scientific information. The reviews are managed by a contractor under the direction of a designated EPA peer review leader, who prepares a peer-review plan, the scope of work for the review contract, and the charge for the reviewers. The peer review leader plays no role in producing the indicators or reports. EPA’s peer-review process also includes a quality-control check by the peer review leader to ensure that the authors took sufficient action and provided an adequate response for every peer review and re-review comment. Existing indicators are re-evaluated to ensure they are relevant, comprehensive, and sustainable. The process of re-evaluating indicators includes monitoring the availability of newer data, eliciting expert review, and assessing indicators in light of new science. EPA improves existing indicators by adding or replacing metrics or underlying data sources. These revisions involve obtaining new data sets and vetting their scientific validity. For example, a new independent data set and analysis has been made available related to trends in ocean heat content. As a result, EPA updated the indicator to include this new data series, making the indicator more comprehensive. EPA compiles technical documentation for every indicator to ensure that it is fully transparent — so readers can learn where the data come from, how each indicator was calculated, and how accurately each indicator represents the intended environmental condition. EPA uses a standard technical documentation format that includes 13 elements for each indicator: Readers can access technical documentation for any indicator through a link on ."

Please . “Centralized generation” refers to the large-scale generation of electricity at centralized facilities. These facilities are usually located away from end-users and connected to a network of high-voltage transmission lines. The electricity generated by centralized generation is distributed through the electric power grid to multiple end-users. Centralized generation facilities include fossil-fuel-fired power plants, nuclear power plants, hydroelectric dams, wind farms, and more. The vast majority of the electricity that Americans use is from centralized generation. Centralized generation facilities in the United States currently have the capacity to generate more than 1,100 gigawatts of electric power. The earliest electric utilities operated independently from each other. A consumer would purchase electricity from a utility in their area, which would then provide the electricity through its own electricity delivery system. During the second half of the 20th century, utilities found it more efficient and economical to connect their delivery systems, resulting in the need to coordinate power plant operations. The majority of electricity generation in the United States today is coordinated by regional system operators to ensure reliability. Therefore, the electricity delivered to consumers by their local electric utility may be generated at a centralized power plant located in another city or state and owned by a different company. These power plants are subject to economic, reliability, and environmental regulations by federal, tribal, state, and/or local governments. The environmental impacts of electricity generation can contribute to large-scale regional environmental concerns as well as localized concerns that affect the area directly surrounding a power plant. Some impacts vary based on the energy resource—for example, whether the power plant uses fossil fuel or a renewable resource. In addition to the impacts from power generation, there are also impacts associated with extracting, producing, and transporting certain fuels such as coal and natural gas. In general, centralized power plants can affect the environment in the following ways: In addition to these environmental impacts, much of the primary energy (total energy content) of fossil fuels burned at power plants is wasted during generation and delivery to end-users. Opportunities exist to improve the energy efficiency of power plants, as well as to locate electricity generation closer to end-users to reduce losses during ."

This feature tracks the annual peak bloom date of Washington, D.C.’s famous cherry trees. This figure shows the timing of peak bloom each year for the main type of cherry tree around the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C. The peak bloom date occurs when 70 percent of the blossoms are in full bloom. The shaded band shows the timing of the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival. The festival began in 1934 but was not held during World War II. Data sources: National Cherry Blossom Festival, 2024; National Park Service, 2024 In Washington, D.C., the arrival of spring brings a splash of color as the city’s iconic cherry trees burst into bloom. The city has enjoyed cherry blossoms each year dating back to 1912, when Japan gave about 3,000 cherry trees to the United States as a gift of friendship. These trees surround Washington’s Tidal Basin, and the beautiful blooms set against the backdrop of the national monuments bring more than 1.5 million visitors to the area every year during the National Cherry Blossom Festival. Not surprisingly, the festival is planned to coincide with the peak bloom of the cherry trees. The exact timing of peak bloom varies from year to year, and it is largely driven by local temperatures during the winter and early spring. Many plants are sensitive to and respond to environmental cues such as when temperature reaches a certain threshold. As the indicator explains, scientists have very high confidence that recent warming trends in global climate are causing spring events such as leaf growth and flower blooms to happen earlier. In the case of Washington’s cherry blossoms, earlier bloom dates could affect tourism and the local economy. The peak bloom date for the most common type of cherry tree around Washington’s Tidal Basin—the Yoshino variety—has been carefully estimated and recorded since 1921 by the National Park Service. The peak bloom date is defined as the day when 70 percent of the blossoms are in full bloom. Figure 1 shows how the peak bloom date of the Yoshino cherry trees has changed since 1921. It also shows the dates of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, which has grown to several weeks as its popularity has expanded. There is considerable variability in the peak bloom date, which makes predicting the exact timing difficult. Anticipation of the peak bloom captivates meteorologists, city planners, the National Park Service, residents, and tourists each year. For this and other examples of community connections to observed climate-related changes, see the StoryMap at: . In addition to winter and early spring temperatures, the timing of the peak bloom for cherry trees can be affected by other weather, climate, and location factors. For example, extended growing periods and warmer autumns could affect bloom dates by altering other stages of cherry tree growth. Peak bloom dates and festival dates were provided by the National Park Service and organizers of the National Cherry Blossom Festival.

Schwartz to data from Schwartz et al., 2013 This figure shows modeled trends in lilac and honeysuckle first bloom dates at weather stations across the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. This map compares the average first bloom date for two 10-year periods. Data source: 2024 update by M. Schwartz to data from Schwartz et al., 2013 The timing of natural events, such as flower blooms and animal migration, is influenced by a combination of environmental factors, including temperature, light, rainfall, and humidity. Phenology is the study of such important seasonal events. Phenological events are influenced by a combination of environmental factors, including temperature, light, rainfall, and humidity. Different plant and animal species respond to different cues. Scientists have very high confidence that the earlier arrival of spring events is linked to recent warming trends in global climate. Disruptions in the timing of these events can have a variety of impacts on ecosystems and human society. For example, an earlier spring might lead to longer growing seasons (see the indicator), more abundant invasive species and pests, and earlier and longer allergy seasons (see the indicator). Unusually warm weather in late winter can create a “false spring” that triggers the new growth of plants to begin too early, leaving them vulnerable to any subsequent frosts. Because of their close connection with climate, the timing of phenological events can be used as an indicator of the sensitivity of ecological processes to climate change. Two particularly useful indicators of the timing of spring events are the first leaf dates and the first bloom dates of lilacs and honeysuckles, which have an easily monitored flowering season, a relatively high survival rate, and a large geographic distribution. The first leaf date in these plants relates to the timing of events that occur in early spring, while the first bloom date is consistent with the timing of later spring events, such as the start of growth in forest vegetation. This indicator shows trends in the timing of first leaf dates and first bloom dates in lilacs and honeysuckles across the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. Because many of the phenological observation records in the United States are less than 40 years long, and because these records may have gaps in time or space, computer models have been used to provide a more complete understanding of long-term trends nationwide. The models for this indicator were developed using data from the USA National Phenology Network, which collects ground observations from a network of federal agencies, field stations, educational institutions, and citizens who have been trained to log observations of leaf and bloom dates. For consistency, observations were limited to a few specific types of lilacs and honeysuckles. Next, models were created to relate actual leaf and bloom observations with records from nearby weather stations. Once scientists were able to determine the relationship between climate factors (particularly temperatures) and leaf and bloom dates, they used this knowledge to estimate leaf and bloom dates for earlier years based on historical weather records. They also used the models to estimate how leaf and bloom dates would have changed in a few areas (mostly the warmest parts of the South and West and the coldest parts of Alaska) where lilacs and honeysuckles are not widespread. This indicator uses data from nearly 3,000 weather stations throughout the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. The exact number of stations varies from year to year. For each year, the timing of first leaf and first bloom at each station was compared with the 1981 to 2010 average to determine the number of days’ “deviation from normal.” This indicator presents the average deviation across all stations, along with maps that compare the most recent 10-year period (2014–2023) with a mid-20 -century baseline (1951–1960) at individual stations. These time periods were chosen to match published studies. Plant phenological events are studied using several data collection methods, including satellite images, models, and direct observations. The use of different data collection methods and different phenological indicators (such as leaf or bloom dates for different types of plants) can lead to a range of estimates of the arrival of spring. Climate is not the only factor that can affect phenology. Observed variations can also reflect plant genetics, changes in the surrounding ecosystem, and other factors. This indicator minimizes the influence of genetic variations by relying on cloned plants, which have no genetic differences. Leaf and bloom observations were compiled by the USA National Phenology Network and are available at: . This indicator is also based on temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, which maintains a large collection of climate data online at: . Data for this indicator were analyzed using methods described by Schwartz et al. (2013)."

This indicator examines changes in the location of fish, shellfish, and other marine species along U.S. coasts.

The multi-region average consists of 157 unique species. Changes in the centers of biomass have been aggregated across all species and by region. For each region, the change in latitude and change in depth are set at zero for a base year, 1989.

Dots are shaded from light to dark to show change over time. Data source: NOAA, 2024 This map shows the annual centers of biomass for three species in the eastern Bering Sea from 1985 to 2022.

Data source: NOAA, 2024 This map shows the annual centers of biomass for three species in the southeastern United States from 1989 to 2019. Dots are shaded from light to dark to show change over time. Data source: NOAA, 2024 Changes in water temperature can affect the environments where fish, shellfish, and other marine species live. Certain fish species naturally migrate in response to seasonal temperature changes, moving northward or to deeper, cooler waters in the summer and migrating back during the winter. As climate change causes the oceans to become warmer year-round (see the and indicators), however, populations of some species may adapt by shifting away from areas that have become too warm and toward areas that were previously cooler. Along U.S. coasts, this means a shift northward or to deeper waters that may have a more suitable temperature. As smaller prey species shift their habitats, larger predator species may follow them. Marine species represent a particularly good indicator of warming oceans because they are sensitive to climate and because they have been studied and tracked for many years. Fish are especially mobile, and they may shift their location more easily than species on land because they face fewer physical barriers. Also, many marine species, especially fish, do not have fixed nesting places or dwellings that might otherwise compel them to stay in one place. Populations of many marine species have been measured consistently for several decades across various types of ocean habitats. Tracking data from many species is useful because if a change in behavior or distribution occurs across a large range of species, it is more likely the result of a more systematic or common cause. The movement of species based on their preferred temperature conditions can affect commercial and recreational fisheries, with implications for fisheries management and the economy of communities that rely on fisheries. Climate-related fishery losses have already resulted in billions of dollars of lost catch in recent years, directly harming jobs, livelihoods, and local culture. Temperature-driven changes in suitable habitats are expected to continue in the future. This indicator tracks marine animal species in terms of their “center of biomass,” which is a point on the map that represents the center of each species’ distribution by weight. If a fish population were to shift generally northward, the center of biomass would shift northward as well. This approach is similar to the way changes in bird population distributions have been measured (see the indicator). Data for this indicator were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service and other agencies. These agencies monitor marine species populations by conducting annual surveys in which they trawl the ocean at regular intervals along the coast. By recording what they catch at each location, scientists can calculate each species’ center of biomass in terms of latitude, longitude, and depth. This indicator focuses on three survey regions that have the most continuous and longest-running sampling: the Northeast, the eastern Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska, and the Southeast. Figure 1 shows the average change in the center of biomass across 157 species in these regions as well as changes by region. For consistency, each line in Figure 1 is limited to species with the most complete records throughout the timeframe shown. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show detailed changes for three species in each region. These species were chosen because they represent a variety of habitats and species types (a mixture of fish and shellfish) and because they tend to be fairly abundant. Some of these species support major fisheries, but are presumed not to be heavily affected by overfishing, reducing the chance that fishing is unduly influencing the observed trends. Northeast data come from surveys that have been conducted every spring since 1974, Bering Sea data come from summer surveys that have been conducted consistently since 1985, and Southeast data come from surveys that have been conducted every spring since 1989. Water temperature is not the only factor that can cause marine animal populations to shift. Other factors could include interactions with other species, harvesting, ocean circulation patterns, habitat change, and species’ ability to disperse and adapt. As a result, species might have moved northward for reasons other than, or in addition to, changing sea temperatures. This indicator is limited to the Northeast, the eastern Bering Sea, and the Southeast because these areas have used consistent survey methods and because they do not have coastlines that would prevent species from moving northward in response to warming (in contrast to regions like the Gulf of Mexico, where the coast blocks northward migration). Data for this indicator were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service during annual bottom trawl fisheries surveys. These data have been processed and made publicly available through the Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal at: . Data from these surveys have been used to support a wide variety of studies."

This feature explores changes in bird populations on an island along Alaska’s Arctic northern coast. This figure shows the number of breeding pairs in the black guillemot colony that inhabits Cooper Island along the north coast of Alaska, measured at the peak of breeding season (green line). The dashed orange line indicates the number of installed nest site structures available to black guillemots on Cooper Island each year. Data source: Divoky, 2024 A colony of black guillemots have made Cooper Island near Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, home for at least 50 years. The area’s unique landscape and sea ice are integral components of this bird’s habitat. The black guillemot spends the winter on Arctic sea ice, and it breeds on land near the edge of the ice in summer. One of the primary food sources for the birds’ chicks is the Arctic cod, which thrives in cold, ice-covered waters. Warming temperatures and other changes are reducing the extent and persistence of Arctic sea ice (see the indicator), which has been linked to a decline in the abundance of Arctic cod over the last few decades. The region has experienced an increase in the number of days without snow cover each year. This longer period has helped the black guillemots during breeding season, when they prefer a snow-free nest cavity. However, as the Arctic has warmed, sea ice has decreased significantly—melting earlier and freezing later. This change, for certain parts of the year, has led to more open water and increased the distance from the coast to the edge of the ice, where these birds forage for Arctic cod. This type of ecosystem change has broader implications not only for these two species, but also for other animals in the Arctic that depend on marine prey, such as polar bears, and for people who depend on Arctic animals for food and other resources. A group of scientists and volunteers have been observing and counting birds at the Cooper Island colony for almost 50 years. Birds are counted every summer and identified as breeding pairs if two are found to be inhabiting a specific nesting site on the island. This long-term record provides valuable clues about how rapid changes being observed in the Arctic may be influencing the natural environment. For this and other examples of community connections to observed climate-related changes, see the StoryMap at: . Changes in the number of breeding pairs in the Cooper Island colony can be influenced by several factors other than the presence or absence of sea ice and resulting reduced prey availability. These other factors include competition from other bird species, the activity of predators such as polar bears, and the success of and immigration from other black guillemot colonies in the Arctic. The timing and duration of the breeding season can also change in response to changing temperatures and snow and ice conditions. In addition, as the count of breeding pairs depends on the observation of successful egg laying, changes in fertility or nest predation could influence annual totals. Consistent methods have been used to count the number of breeding pairs on Cooper Island annually for more than 40 years. Guillemots began breeding at Cooper Island sometime after the U.S. Navy left wooden boxes on the island in the mid-1950s, which the birds used for nesting. The colony was officially discovered by researchers in 1972, when it consisted of 10 breeding pairs. The researchers began building artificial nest sites, adding 190 sites before they stopped in the mid-1980s. Cooper Island had more breeding pairs than nest sites in the late 1980s, when some of the larger nesting sites were occupied by more than one pair. Additional birds were present but were unable to breed due to the limited number of nest cavities. The data in this feature are collected by researchers and provided by George Divoky and the Friends of Cooper Island ( ). This data set has been used and published as part of peer-reviewed journal articles on observed changes in northern Alaska—particularly the region near Utqiagvik."

The shaded band shows the likely range for the average, based on how all the individual species have moved over time. Data source: National Audubon Society, 2014 Changes in climate can affect ecosystems by influencing animal behavior and ranges. Birds are a particularly good indicator of environmental change for several reasons: Temperature and precipitation patterns are changing across the United States (see the indicator and the indicator). Some bird species can adapt to generally warmer temperatures by changing where they live—for example, by migrating farther north in the summer but not as far south in the winter, or by shifting inland as winter temperature extremes grow less severe. Non-migratory species might shift as well, expanding into newly suitable habitats while moving out of areas that become less suitable. Other types of birds might not adapt to changing conditions and could experience a population decline as a result. Climate change can also alter the timing of events that are based on temperature cues, such as migration and breeding (especially egg-laying). This indicator looks collectively at the “center of abundance” of hundreds of widespread North American bird species over a 48-year period. The center of abundance is a point on the map that represents the middle of each species’ distribution. If a whole population of birds were to shift generally northward, one would see the center of abundance shift northward as well. For year-to-year consistency, this indicator uses observations from the National Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count, which takes place every year in early winter. The Christmas Bird Count is a long-running citizen-science program in which individuals are organized by the National Audubon Society, Bird Studies Canada, local Audubon chapters, and other bird clubs to identify and count bird species. The data presented in this indicator were collected from more than 2,000 locations throughout the United States and parts of Canada. At each location, skilled observers follow a standard counting procedure to estimate the number of birds within a 15-mile diameter “count circle” over a 24-hour period. Study methods remain generally consistent from year to year. Data produced by the Christmas Bird Count go through several levels of review before Audubon scientists analyze the final data, which have been used to support a wide variety of peer-reviewed studies. Many factors can influence bird ranges, including food availability, habitat alteration, and interactions with other species. As a result, some of the birds included in this indicator might have moved north for reasons other than changing temperatures. This indicator does not show how responses to climate change vary among different types of birds. For example, a more detailed National Audubon Society analysis found large differences among coastal birds, grassland birds, and birds adapted to feeders, which all have different abilities to adapt to temperature changes. Some data variations can be caused by differences among count circles, such as inconsistent level of effort by volunteer observers, but these differences are carefully corrected in Audubon’s statistical analysis. Bird center-of-abundance data were collected by the annual Christmas Bird Count organized by the National Audubon Society and Bird Studies Canada. Recent and historical Christmas Bird Count data are available at: . The National Audubon Society published a previous version of this analysis in 2009, summarized at: ."

This indicator measures water levels and surface water temperatures in the Great Lakes. This figure displays how water levels in each of the Great Lakes have changed since 1860. For each year, the shaded band shows the range of monthly average water levels, and the line in the middle shows the annual average. The graph uses the 1981 to 2010 average as a baseline for depicting change. Choosing a different baseline period would not change the shape of the data over time. Lakes Michigan and Huron are shown together because they are connected at the same water level. Data source: NOAA, 2024 This figure shows the average surface water temperatures in each of the Great Lakes, as measured by satellites. The graphs on the left show annual averages for the full time period, while the graphs on the right show how average daily temperatures have changed between two time periods for comparison: 2014–2023 versus 1995–2004. Data source: NOAA, 2024 Water level and water temperature are two important and interrelated indicators of weather and climate change in the Great Lakes. Water level (the height of the lake surface above sea level) is influenced by many factors, including precipitation, snowmelt runoff, drought, evaporation rates, and people withdrawing water for multiple uses. Water temperature is influenced by many factors, too, but most directly by air temperature. In some recent years, high precipitation has contributed to higher-than-average and sometimes record-breaking water levels in the Great Lakes. In other recent years, warmer surface water temperatures in the Great Lakes have contributed to lower water levels by increasing rates of evaporation and causing lake ice to form later than usual (see the indicator), which extends the season for evaporation. Lower water levels in the Great Lakes forced ships to reduce their cargo tonnage by 5 to 8 percent between 1997 and 2000, which increased shipping costs. Lower water levels can also affect water supplies, the usability of infrastructure such as docks and piers, and shoreline ecosystems. Scientists who use computer models to simulate future climate change are not sure whether Great Lakes water levels will increase or decrease overall in the future, but they generally agree that there will be larger year-to-year variability, driven by periods of drought and extreme precipitation. Another possible effect of warmer water, reduced ice cover, and increased evaporation is a corresponding increase in precipitation over nearby land, especially “lake effect” snow (see the indicator). Rising water temperatures are also expected to expand the ranges of and give new advantages to some invasive species such as the zebra mussel, and to encourage the growth of certain waterborne bacteria that can make people ill. This indicator analyzes water levels and surface water temperatures in the Great Lakes. Water levels are recorded by gauges along the shore of each lake, some of which have been operated since the 1800s. Pre-1918 data came from one water level gauge per lake. Data since 1918 have come from a designated set of gauges in each lake. Figure 1 shows annual water level anomalies in each lake from 1860 to 2023; anomalies are differences, in feet, compared with a baseline (in this case, the 1981–2010 average). Lakes Michigan and Huron are combined because they are connected at the same water level. Surface water temperatures are measured by satellites. Figure 2 shows annual average temperatures over the entire surface of each lake, along with the pattern of daily temperatures over the course of the year. This figure’s data begin in 1995, which was the first year with complete satellite data for all five lakes. While climate change influences water levels, human activities such as dredging can also play a role. For example, the St. Clair River opening was enlarged in the 1910s, 1930s, and 1960s, contributing to greater outflows from Lakes Michigan and Huron. Similarly, natural year-to-year variability and other factors such as human use and wastewater discharges can influence water temperatures. Water level data were provided by the Canadian Hydrographic Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services, and can be downloaded from: .

This indicator shows changes in surface water temperatures in North American lakes. This map shows the total change in the average July–September surface water temperatures in 34 North American lakes from 1985 to 2009, as measured by satellites. Red circles represent warming; blue circles represent cooling. Larger circles indicate larger changes. Circles with black borders represent lakes where the trend was statistically significant. Data source: Sharma et al., 2015 Water temperature is an important physical property of every lake. Many plants, animals, and other organisms flourish only in a specific range of water temperatures. Temperature can also affect certain aspects of water quality. For example, higher temperatures promote the growth of algae and bacteria, but they also reduce levels of dissolved oxygen in the water, which can negatively affect the growth and productivity of other aquatic life. Water temperature also influences the circulation or mixing patterns within a lake, which affects nutrient levels. Temperature influences how people are able to use lakes. For example, while warmer water might be more inviting for recreation, it also contributes to blooms of harmful algae and bacteria that produce toxins. These toxins can cause illnesses in recreational users and contaminate drinking water supplies. Warmer water lengthens the season when lakes are ice-free (see the indicator). This can benefit boaters and shippers but also increases evaporation, lowering water levels (see the indicator). Less lake ice reduces opportunities for winter recreation, such as ice fishing and hockey. Water temperature is influenced by many factors, but most directly by air temperature. As rising air temperatures (see the indicator) cause lake temperatures to rise, the geographic ranges and growth seasons of certain harmful algae and bacteria are expected to expand. Rising water temperatures are also expected to expand the ranges of and give new advantages to certain invasive species, such as the zebra mussel. This indicator looks at the average summer water temperatures of 34 lakes in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, based on satellite measurements that detect the temperature of the water at the surface (approximately 1 meter or 3 feet in depth). Because water temperature can also be influenced by wastewater discharges and other human activities, this indicator focuses on a select set of lakes that are relatively large, natural bodies of water (all more than 150 square miles) where consistent data dating back to 1985 were available. Furthermore, each lake’s measurements were taken in a single location near the center of the lake to minimize influences such as shoreline development and other land use activities. Figure 1 shows long-term rates of change in surface lake water temperature from 1985 to 2009. Natural year-to-year variability in air temperatures and other factors can influence water temperatures. This indicator accounts for these types of variations by focusing on long-term trends over 25 years of data. Water temperatures can also vary at different locations within a lake. Measurements taken at one location may be representative of the lake as a whole, but it is also possible that other parts of the lake have warmed or cooled at different rates. This indicator uses nighttime measurements to avoid being overly influenced by short-term heating during the day. This indicator is limited to summer temperatures because these measurements are not likely to be distorted by ice cover. Summer measurements are particularly useful because this time of year is when many aquatic organisms are most active. For example, summer is the peak season for the growth of algae, and summer maximum temperatures determine whether lakes and ponds can support certain types of coldwater fish, such as trout. Summer lake temperatures are important as they influence how the water separates into warm and cold layers, which affects mixing and the availability of oxygen and nutrients. Satellite data were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European Space Agency and processed by a group of researchers from multiple organizations called the Global Lake Temperature Collaboration. Processed data for each lake are available from the Long Term Ecological Research Network Data Portal at: ."

Data source: USGS, 2023 Climate change has challenged and will continue to challenge some of the traditional ways of life that have sustained indigenous peoples for thousands of years. In the Pacific Northwest, warming river and stream temperatures will threaten ecosystems and species, including salmon populations. Salmon play a particularly important role in the diet, culture, religion, and economy of Native Americans in this region. Salmon are sensitive to water temperature at many stages of their lives. They spend much of their adult lives in the ocean, then migrate inland to spawn. Salmon need cold water to migrate and for their young to hatch and grow successfully. Warmer water can negatively affect fish, making it more difficult for them to swim upstream. It can also make fish more susceptible to disease. River and stream temperatures in the Pacific Northwest are influenced by many factors, but are expected to rise as average air temperatures increase (see the indicator). The graph shows average August water temperatures at a site in the Snake River, in eastern Washington near Nez Perce tribal lands. Several species of salmon use the Snake River to migrate and spawn.

This indicator shows changes in stream water temperature across the Chesapeake Bay region. This map shows the change in water temperature at 129 stream gauges across the Chesapeake Bay region from 1960 to 2014. Red circles show locations where temperatures have increased; blue circles show locations where temperatures have decreased. Filled circles represent sites where the change was statistically significant. Data source: Jastram and Rice, 2015 Water temperature is an important physical property of every river and stream. Many plants, animals, and other organisms living in streams can flourish only in a specific range of water temperatures. Temperature can affect certain aspects of water quality. For example, higher temperatures reduce levels of dissolved oxygen in the water, which can negatively affect the growth and productivity of aquatic life. Persistently warmer temperatures in streams can accelerate natural chemical reactions and release excess nutrients into the water. A stream’s water temperature can also influence the circulation or mixing patterns in the water it flows into, like bays and estuaries, potentially affecting nutrient levels and salinity. Temperatures can vary naturally along the length of a stream, from cold temperatures near a source of meltwater to higher temperatures near its outlet to the sea. The temperature at any given point is a product of many different factors, including sources of water (for example, melted snow, a recent rainstorm, or groundwater), the amount of water in the stream (streamflow), air temperature, plants along the bank (for example, trees that provide shade), and the amount of development within the watershed. Over time, however, an area’s climate has the strongest natural influence on a stream’s temperature. The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, an important habitat for countless aquatic species, and a driver of the regional economy. As rising air temperatures (see the indicator) cause stream temperatures to rise, warmer stream water coming into the bay can stress plants and animals and worsen the effects of nutrient pollution that the bay is already facing. The U.S. Geological Survey maintains thousands of stream gauges across the United States. Each gauge measures water levels several times a day, typically every 15 minutes. Field technicians visit each gauging station an average of eight times a year to measure various stream conditions, including water temperature. This indicator shows how average water temperatures throughout the year changed between 1960 and 2014 at 129 stream gauges located across the Chesapeake Bay region. These stations were selected because they had high-quality data for this entire time period. In addition to climate, changes to a stream’s average water temperature can be influenced by other factors such as industrial discharges, changes to local hydrology (such as construction and operation of dams and channels), and changes to land cover in the watershed. This indicator uses measurements from all stream gauges with sufficient data. Thus, it includes some stream sites that are likely more disturbed by human activities than others. A more detailed analysis of this data set found that water temperature tends to increase more quickly than air temperature in agricultural areas without major dams, but more slowly at forested sites and in areas influenced by dams. Nonetheless, a comparison of 35 relatively undisturbed reference stations with the remaining 94 stations in this indicator showed no significant difference in trends between the two groups of stations. This indicator is based on measurements that are collected an average of eight times per year, but more in some years and less in others. The data were analyzed in a way that accounts for variations in timing and makes it possible to compare average temperatures across many years. This indicator is based on an analysis developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Periodic temperature data were collected by the USGS, and these data are stored in the USGS National Water Information System."

This indicator describes trends in the amount of water carried by streams across the United States, as well as the timing of runoff associated with snowmelt. This map shows percentage changes in the minimum annual streamflow for rivers and streams across the country, based on the long-term rate of change from 1940 to 2022. Minimum streamflow is based on the consecutive seven-day period with the lowest average flow during a given year. Data source: USGS, 2023 This map shows percentage changes in the maximum annual streamflow for rivers and streams across the country, based on the long-term rate of change from 1940 to 2022. Maximum streamflow is based on the consecutive three-day period with the highest average flow during a given year. Data source: USGS, 2023 This map shows percentage changes in the annual average streamflow for rivers and streams across the country, based on the long-term rate of change from 1940 to 2022. This map is based on daily streamflow measurements, averaged over the entire year. Data source: USGS, 2023 This map shows changes in the timing of annual high winter-spring flow carried by rivers and streams from 1940 to 2022. This analysis focuses on parts of the country where streamflow is strongly influenced by snowmelt. Trends are based on the winter-spring center of volume, which is the date when half of the total January 1–July 31 streamflow (in the West) or half of the total January 1–May 31 streamflow (in the East) has passed by each streamflow gauge, reflecting the timing of spring snowmelt. Data source: USGS, 2023 This map shows changes in the number of days with very low streamflow for rivers and streams across the country, from 1940 to 2022. This map is based on the number of daily flow values below the 2-percentile flow (Q2) threshold. Positive trends (upward brown triangles) indicate an increase in the number of days per year at or below the Q2 threshold (drier conditions); negative trends (downward blue triangles) indicate a trend toward fewer very low flow days (wetter conditions). Data source: USGS, 2023 Streamflow is a measure of the rate at which water is carried by rivers and streams, and it represents a critical resource for people and the environment. Changes in streamflow can directly influence the supply of drinking water and the amount of water available for irrigating crops, generating electricity, and other needs. In addition, many plants and animals depend on streamflow for habitat and survival. Streamflow naturally varies over the course of a year. For example, rivers and streams in many parts of the country have their highest flow when snow melts in the spring and their lowest flow in late summer. The amount of streamflow is important because very high flows can cause erosion and damaging floods, while very low flows can diminish water quality, harm fish, reduce the amount of water available for people to use, and disrupt economic activities like river shipping. The timing of high flow is important because it affects the ability of reservoir managers to store water to meet needs later in the year. In addition, some plants and animals (such as fish that migrate) depend on a particular pattern of streamflow as part of their life cycles. Climate change can affect streamflow in several ways. Changes in the amount of spring snowpack (see the indicator) and air temperatures that influence melting can alter the size and timing of high spring streamflows. More precipitation is expected to cause higher average streamflow in some places, while heavier storms (see the indicator) could lead to larger peak flows. More frequent or severe droughts, however, could reduce streamflow in certain areas. The U.S. Geological Survey measures streamflow in rivers and streams across the United States using continuous monitoring devices called stream gauges. This indicator is based on data from 189 stream gauges located in areas where trends are not substantially influenced by dams, reservoir management, wastewater treatment facilities, or land-use change. The indicator also excludes stream gauges with watershed areas that overlap substantially. This indicator examines five important measures of streamflow conditions that occur during the course of a year. Figure 1 shows trends in the lowest flows each year, which are commonly calculated by averaging the lowest seven consecutive days of streamflow. Figure 2 shows trends in high flow conditions, which are commonly calculated by averaging the highest three consecutive days of streamflow in a year. Three days is an optimal length of time to characterize runoff associated with large storms and peak snowmelt. Figure 3 shows changes in the annual average streamflow, which is calculated by averaging daily flows through the entire year. Figure 4 shows trends in the timing of winter and spring runoff. This measure is limited to 56 stream gauges in areas where at least 30 percent of annual precipitation falls as snow. Scientists look at the total volume of water that passes by a gauge between January 1 and July 31 for the western United States, and January 1 and May 31 for the eastern United States, then determine the date when exactly half of that water has gone by. This date is called the winter-spring center-of-volume date. A long-term trend toward an earlier date could be caused by earlier spring snowmelt, more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow, or other changes in precipitation patterns. Figure 5 shows trends in the number of days each year with very low flow, which indicates whether streams are becoming drier or wetter during the period. The figure shows the annual number of days that daily average streamflow is equal to or lower than the long-term 2-percentile flow (Q2) threshold. In general, daily average flows are equal to or lower than the Q2 threshold about seven days of the year. Streamflow measurements were used from gauges in areas where streamflow is minimally affected by human influences such as dams, land development, or changes in land cover. Changes in land cover and land use over time, however, could still influence streamflow trends at some streams. The gauges used for this indicator are not evenly distributed across the country, due to variation in the availability of long-term data. Streamflow data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. These data came from a set of gauges in watersheds with minimal human impacts, which have been classified as reference gauges. Daily average streamflow data are stored in the National Water Information System and are publicly available at: ."

These totals include all reported wildfires, which can be as small as just a few acres. The two lines represent two different reporting systems; though the Forest Service stopped collecting statistics (orange line) in 1997 and will not update them, those statistics are shown here for comparison. Data source: NIFC, 2024; USDA Forest Service, 2014 This figure shows annual wildfire-burned area (in millions of acres) from 1983 to 2022. The two lines represent two different reporting systems though the Forest Service stopped collecting statistics (orange line) in 1997 and is not planning to update them, those statistics are shown here for comparison. Data source: NIFC, 2024; Short, 2015 This figure shows the distribution of acreage burned by large wildfires, based on the level of damage caused to the landscape—a measure of wildfire severity. Large wildfires are defined as fires with an area larger than 1,000 acres in the western United States and 500 acres in the eastern United States. The total acreage shown in Figure 3 is slightly less than the total in Figure 2 because Figure 3 is limited to large fires and because a few areas did not have sufficient satellite imagery to allow damage to be assessed. Data source: MTBS, 2024 This map shows the average number of acres burned in each state per year as a proportion of that state’s total land area. Darker-shaded states have the largest proportion of acreage burned. For reference, there are 640 acres in a square mile; therefore, an average burned area of 6.4 acres per square mile would mean that fires burned 1 percent of a state’s total land area. States that did not have any fires that were large enough to be included in this analysis are shaded gray. Click on a state to reveal the trend in a line graph.

Data source: MTBS, 2024 This figure compares the annual distribution of burned area due to wildfires in the United States between the first half of the period of measurement (1984–2002) and the second half (2003–2021). Data source: MTBS, 2023 This figure compares the annual distribution of burned area due to wildfires in the eastern and western United States between the first half of the period of measurement (1984–2002) and the second half (2003–2021). Data source: MTBS, 2023 Together, forests, shrubland, and grassland cover more than half of the land area in the United States. These ecosystems are important resources, both environmentally and economically. Although wildfires occur naturally and play a long-term role in the health of these ecosystems, changing wildfire patterns threaten to upset the status quo. Multiple studies have found that climate change has already led to an increase in wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and burned area. The wildfire season has lengthened in many areas due to factors including warmer springs, longer summer dry seasons, and drier soils and vegetation. Similarly, climate change threatens to increase the frequency, extent, and severity of fires through increased temperatures and drought (see the and indicators). Earlier spring melting and reduced snowpack (see the indicator) result in decreased water availability during hot summer conditions, which in turn contributes to an increased wildfire risk, allowing fires to start more easily and burn hotter. These trends of longer wildfire seasons and larger wildfire size are predicted to continue as more frequent and longer droughts occur. In addition to climate change, other factors—land use, large-scale insect infestation, fuel availability (including invasive species such as highly flammable cheatgrass), and management practices, including fire suppression—play an important role in wildfire frequency and intensity. All of these factors influencing wildfires vary greatly by region and over time, as do precipitation, wind, temperature, vegetation types, and landscape conditions. Therefore, understanding changes in fire characteristics requires long-term records, a regional perspective, and consideration of many factors. Wildfires have the potential to harm property, livelihoods, and human health. Fire-related threats are increasing, especially as more people live in and near forests, grasslands, and other natural areas. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, between 1980 and 2023 the United States had 22 wildfire events that individually caused more than $1 billion in damage; 18 of those have occurred since 2000. Over the past few decades, the United States has routinely spent more than $1 billion per year to fight wildfires, including $3.5 billion in 2022. These efforts have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of firefighters. Even in communities far downwind, wildfire smoke has been directly linked to poor air quality that can lead to significant health effects and costs to society (emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and deaths, often due to respiratory ailments). Beyond the human and societal impacts, wildfires also affect the Earth’s climate. Forests in particular store large amounts of carbon. When they burn, they immediately release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which in turn contributes to climate change. After burning, forests also release carbon dioxide more gradually through decomposition. This indicator defines a wildfire as \"a wildland fire originating from an unplanned ignition, such as lightning, volcanos, unauthorized and accidental human caused fires, and prescribed fires that are declared wildfires.” This indicator tracks four aspects of wildfires over time: the total number of fires (frequency), the total land area burned (extent), the degree of damage that fires cause to the landscape (severity), and the acreage burned by fires starting in each month of the year (seasonal patterns). The total area and total number of fires are tracked by the National Interagency Fire Center, which compiles reports from local, state, and federal agencies that are involved in fighting wildfires. The U.S. Forest Service tracked similar data using a different reporting system until 1997. Those data have been added to this indicator for comparison. Burn severity, state-level acreage, and monthly totals are based on data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project, which provides the location, ignition date, size, and other statistics for every individual wildfire that meets certain size criteria (≥ 1,000 acres in the western United States or ≥ 500 acres in the eastern United States). MTBS compares the “greenness” of satellite images taken before and after a fire to classify how severely the land has been burned. Burn severity provides an indication of the ecological damage and how long the effects of wildfires are likely to last. Although some nationwide fire data have been collected since the early 1900s, this indicator starts in 1983 (Figures 1 and 2) and 1984 (Figures 3 through 7), when nationwide data collection became more complete and standardized. EPA divided the time period in Figures 5, 6, and 7 into two roughly equal halves to compare changes in wildfire characteristics over time. Many environmental impacts associated with climate change can affect the severity and timing of the wildfire season, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and drought. Short-term weather conditions (dryness, temperature, wind, lightning) influence the likelihood of ignition, where and how quickly a fire spreads, and how big it gets. Longer-term climate patterns also play a role by creating conditions that may be conducive to wildfire (for example, a multi-year regional drought). Human activities and land management practices also affect wildfire activity, and preferred practices in wildfire management have evolved over time, from older policies that favored complete wildfire prevention to more recent policies of wildfire suppression and controlled burns. Resources available to fight and manage wildfires can also influence the amount of area burned over time. While this indicator is limited to “wildland” fires, it includes fires that encroach on—or perhaps started in—developed areas. Increased development in previously wild lands could also influence trends in wildfire frequency and extent. The total number of fires may also vary due to reporting irregularities, as fires that split or merge together across jurisdictional lines may be counted differently. Along with the influence of ongoing climate change, wildfire patterns can be influenced by natural climate cycles that tend to shift every few decades. Thus, with less than four decades of data shown here, it might be challenging to draw conclusions about long-term trends. While a longer record would be ideal, data from before 1983 are not consistent or detailed enough nationally to be included in this indicator. The full set of wildfire frequency and burned acreage data in Figures 1 and 2 comes from the National Interagency Fire Center, which compiles wildfire reports sent from local, state, and federal entities that are involved in fighting fires. These data are available online at: . Additional data were provided by the U.S. Forest Service based on a different set of records, referred to as Smokey Bear Reports. Burn severity data, state-by-state acreage totals, and monthly acreage data in Figures 3 through 7 come from the MTBS multi-agency project, which maintains a database of wildfire events across the United States. These data are publicly available at: ."

Ecosystems provide humans with food, clean water, and a variety of other services that can be affected by climate change. This chapter looks at some of the ways that climate change affects ecosystems, including changes in wildfires, streams and lakes, bird migration patterns, fish and shellfish populations, and plant growth. Changes in the Earth’s climate can affect ecosystems by altering the water cycle, habitats, animal behavior—such as nesting and migration patterns—and the timing of natural processes such as flower blooms. Changes that disrupt the functioning of ecosystems may increase the risk of harm or even extinction for some species. While wildfires occur naturally, more frequent and more intense fires can significantly disrupt ecosystems, damage property, put people and communities at risk, and create air pollution problems even far away from the source. While plants and animals have adapted to environmental change for millions of years, the climate changes being experienced now could require adaptation on larger and faster scales than current species have successfully achieved in the past, thus increasing the risk of extinction or severe disruption for many species."

This indicator depicts changes in the length of ragweed pollen season in the United States and Canada. This figure shows how the length of ragweed pollen season changed at 11 locations in the central United States and Canada between 1995 and 2015. Red circles represent a longer pollen season; the blue circle represents a shorter season. Larger circles indicate larger changes. Data source: Ziska et al., 2016 Allergies are a major public health concern, with hay fever (congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes) accounting for more than 13 million visits to physicians’ offices and other medical facilities every year. One of the most common environmental allergens is ragweed, which can cause hay fever and trigger asthma attacks, especially in children and the elderly. An estimated 15.5 percent of all Americans are sensitive to ragweed. Ragweed plants mature in mid-summer and produce small flowers that generate pollen. Ragweed pollen season usually peaks in late summer and early fall, but these plants often continue to produce pollen until the first frost. A single ragweed plant can produce up to a billion pollen grains in one season, and these grains can be carried long distances by the wind. Climate change can affect pollen allergies in several ways. Warmer spring temperatures cause some plants to start producing pollen earlier (see the indicator), while warmer fall temperatures extend the growing season for other plants, such as ragweed (see the indicator). Warmer temperatures and increased carbon dioxide concentrations also lead ragweed and other plants to produce more pollen, and the pollen they produce is more allergenic. This means that many locations could experience longer allergy seasons and higher pollen counts as a result of climate change. This indicator shows changes in the length of the ragweed pollen season in 11 cities in the central United States and Canada. These locations were selected as part of a study that looked at trends in pollen season at sites similar in elevation, but across a range of latitudes from south to north. At each location, air samples have been collected and examined since at least the 1990s as part of a national allergy monitoring network. Pollen spores are counted and identified using microscopes. Pollen counts from each station have been analyzed to determine the start and end dates of each year’s ragweed pollen season. Because the length of ragweed season naturally varies from year to year, statistical techniques have been used to determine the average rate of change over time. This indicator shows the total change in season length from 1995 to 2015, which was determined by multiplying the average annual rate of change by the number of years in the period. This indicator is based on data from a limited number of cities in the central states and provinces. These cities cover a broad range from north to south, however, which allows researchers to establish a clear connection between pollen season changes and latitude. Many factors can influence year-to-year changes in pollen season, including typical local and regional variations in temperature and precipitation, extreme events such as floods and droughts, and changes in plant diversity. In addition, seasonal pollen production may differ between stations located in densely urbanized areas and stations in outlying areas. Adding more years of data would provide a better picture of long-term trends, but widespread data were not available prior to 1995. This indicator does not show how the intensity of ragweed pollen season (pollen counts) might also be changing. Data for this indicator come from the National Allergy Bureau, which is part of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology’s Aeroallergen Network. Data were compiled and analyzed by a team of researchers that published a more detailed version of this analysis in a scientific journal with data through 2009."

This indicator shows changes in growing degree days, which can signal changes in the timing and length of pollen seasons in the United States. This map shows trends in the total number of growing degree days per year at 280 weather stations. The color and size of the symbols represent percent change between 1948 and 2023, based on the long-term average rate of change. Data source: NOAA, 2024 Increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and changes in climate—such as increasing temperatures and altered precipitation patterns—are expected to contribute to increases in levels and distribution of plant pollen. Pollen from trees and grasses is a common allergen that can trigger health effects such as allergic rhinitis (“hay fever”) and asthma. In the United States in 2021, 26 percent of adults reported having at least one seasonal allergy. About 8 percent of adults and 6.5 percent of children also reported suffering from asthma, and this population of asthmatics accounts for about 1 million emergency department visits yearly. These health effects lead to economic costs from medical expenses and missed work and school days. Asthma caused an estimated $50 billion in medical expenses and $3 billion in the value of lost work and school days in 2013. Direct medical spending to treat hay fever was estimated at $3.4 billion in 2011. Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native populations are particularly sensitive to longer pollen seasons because they have the highest rates of asthma in the United States, and urban Black and Hispanic children tend to experience more symptoms of hay fever. The timing of pollen seasons is linked to climate trends and variations, including changes in growing degree days—a widely used measure for tracking plant growth and development. As with the indicator, growing degree days are based on temperature, because plants typically only grow when the temperature is above a certain minimum. Studies have shown that as growing degree days increase, grass pollen season grows longer and oak and birch pollen seasons begin earlier. Earlier pollen season start dates are associated with a longer pollen season overall. More broadly, growing degree days also affect plant growth, agricultural production, and the spread and impact of plant diseases and pests. Growing degree days are calculated using daily temperature data from weather stations. As with the indicator, growing degree days are based on the number of degrees above a certain minimum temperature. Different plants have different temperature requirements, so EPA chose a baseline temperature of 50°F, which is commonly used for analysis when there are multiple plant species of interest. Using this baseline, a day with an average temperature of 70°F represents 20 growing degree days. This indicator examines changes in the number of growing degree days from 1948 to 2023 at locations across the United States. This indicator includes 280 weather stations operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration because they had sufficient data completeness during the entire period of record. For each station, daily growing degrees were calculated by taking the average of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, then subtracting 50°F. Daily results were added together to calculate total annual growing degree days for each year from 1948 to 2023. Figure 1 shows how the total number of growing degree days per year has changed over time at each location. Growing degree days reflect cumulative conditions that support plant development, but they do not capture potentially important factors related to the sequence of weather conditions, which can also have considerable effects on plant development. Factors other than growing degree days also affect pollen season duration and start date. Some of those factors relate to plant growth patterns, and some—such as local plant composition, geographic location (latitude), and proximity to urban areas—are not directly related to climate. As a result, the exact link between growing degree days and pollen season timing is not precise and may vary over time and at different locations. Also, a change in total growing degree days does not necessarily change the intensity of the pollen season. Nonetheless, because allergies are a major public health concern, observed changes in growing degree days, which serve as a proxy for changes in pollen season length and start date, provide insight into ways in which climate change may affect human well-being. Temperature data for this indicator come from the Global Historical Climatology Network, maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The analysis draws on prior research by Zhang et al. (2015) on the relationship between growing degree days and pollen."

This indicator tracks the rate of reported West Nile neuroinvasive disease cases across the United States. This figure shows the annual incidence of West Nile neuroinvasive disease, which is calculated as the number of new cases per 100,000 people. The graph is based on cases that local and state health departments report to CDC’s national disease tracking system. Neuroinvasive cases, which account for less than 1 percent of people infected with West Nile virus, are those that affect the brain or cause neurologic dysfunction. Data source: CDC, 2023 This map shows the average annual incidence of West Nile neuroinvasive disease in each state, which is calculated as the average number of new cases per 100,000 people per year from 2002 to 2021. The map is based on cases that local and state health departments report to CDC’s national disease tracking system. Neuroinvasive cases, which account for less than 1 percent of people infected with West Nile virus, are those that affect the brain or cause neurologic dysfunction. Data source: CDC, 2023 Climate change is expected to affect the geographic and seasonal patterns of vector-borne diseases (that is, diseases caused by pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, or other arthropods) in the United States. West Nile virus was first detected in the United States in 1999 and is now the most common cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States in most years. While many infected people feel no symptoms, others can experience symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, as well as more severe damage to the central nervous system in some patients, causing encephalitis, meningitis, and occasionally death. From 1999 to 2021, a total of 55,443 cases of West Nile virus disease were reported in to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nearly half of the reported cases of people infected with West Nile virus were neuroinvasive—that is, affecting the brain or causing neurologic dysfunction. Mosquitoes acquire the virus by biting infected birds, which are the main hosts of the virus. People are then infected when they are bitten by these virus-carrying mosquitoes. Climate change increases the risk of human exposure to West Nile virus. Studies show that warmer temperatures associated with climate change can accelerate mosquito development, biting rates, and the incubation of the disease within a mosquito. The effect of climate change on the timing of bird migration and breeding patterns may also contribute to changes in long-range virus movement. Mild winters and drought have been associated with West Nile virus disease outbreaks, while rainfall can also contribute by creating breeding sites for mosquitoes. Climate is just one of many important factors that influence the transmission, distribution, and incidence of West Nile virus disease. Human exposure to infected mosquitoes is also influenced by multiple factors, including changes in the proximity of human populations to mosquitoes and host bird species, increased awareness of West Nile virus, and modified behaviors, such as spending less time outdoors during peak mosquito-biting times and taking precautions to avoid being bitten. West Nile disease is one of many . This indicator looks at the incidence of human cases of West Nile virus disease, which reflects the rate of new cases contracted in a given geographic area and time period. Incidence is typically calculated as the number of cases per 100,000 people per year. This indicator focuses on neuroinvasive cases, as the symptoms are noticeable and typically require medical care. The indicator summarizes surveillance data reported to the CDC. West Nile is a nationally notifiable disease, which means health care providers are required to report confirmed cases to their local or state health departments. CDC compiles these reported data and calculates national totals and rates. Figure 1 shows national incidence by year since 2002, when West Nile virus first became notifiable. Figure 2 shows the incidence for each state, averaged over the period from 2002 to 2021. This indicator depends on clinicians making the correct diagnosis and reporting laboratory-confirmed cases to public health authorities. Changes in diagnosing practices, awareness of the virus, and mosquito control efforts over time can affect trends. Cases are reported based on the patient’s state of residence, which is not necessarily the place where they were infected. Non-neuroinvasive cases of West Nile virus disease have been tracked since 2005, but because the symptoms may be mild or undetected they are significantly underreported. Thus, this indicator only focuses on neuroinvasive cases. Because of the many factors affecting mosquito populations and reporting of West Nile virus disease and the fact that data have only been collected for a little more than a decade, this indicator does not provide sufficient information to determine what proportion of the observed changes in incidence is directly driven by climate change. Further study is critical to improving the usefulness of this indicator and informing decisions affecting public health.

This indicator tracks the rate of reported Lyme disease cases across the United States. This figure shows the annual incidence of Lyme disease, which is calculated as the number of new cases per 100,000 people. The graph is based on cases that local and state health departments report to CDC’s national disease tracking system. Data source: CDC, 2019 This map shows how reported Lyme disease incidence has changed by state since 1991, based on the number of new cases per 100,000 people. The total change has been estimated from the average annual rate of change in each state. This map is limited to the 15 states where Lyme disease is most common, where annual rates are consistently above 10 cases per 100,000 people. Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island have had changes in reporting methods that make it difficult to calculate an accurate trend. Data source: CDC, 2019 These maps show the distribution of Lyme disease cases reported to CDC in 1996 and 2018. Each dot represents an individual case placed according to the patient’s county of residence, which may be different from the county of exposure. The year 1996 was chosen as a reasonable starting point for comparison with recent years. These maps focus on the parts of the United States where Lyme disease is most common. The lack of dots in Massachusetts in 2018 is due to a difference in reporting standards, not an absence of Lyme disease. Data source: CDC, 2019 Lyme disease is a bacterial illness that can cause fever, fatigue, joint pain, and skin rash, as well as more serious joint and nervous system complications. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease (that is, a disease transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas) in the United States. In recent years, approximately 20,000–30,000 confirmed cases of Lyme disease per year have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the actual number of illnesses is likely greater than what is reported to health officials. Lyme disease is transmitted through the bite of certain species of infected ticks (referred to commonly as deer ticks) that carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. These ticks live not only on deer, but also on rodents, birds, and other host animals. Deer do not harbor the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, but certain other hosts such as white-footed mice do, and ticks pick up the bacteria by feeding on these infected hosts. Studies provide evidence that climate change has contributed to the expanded range of ticks, increasing the potential risk of Lyme disease, such as in areas of Canada where the ticks were previously unable to survive. The life cycle and prevalence of deer ticks are strongly influenced by temperature. For example, deer ticks are mostly active when temperatures are above 45˚F, and they thrive in areas with at least 85-percent humidity. Thus, warming temperatures associated with climate change are projected to increase the range of suitable tick habitat and are, therefore, one of multiple factors driving the observed spread of Lyme disease. Because tick activity depends on temperatures being above a certain minimum, shorter winters could also extend the period when ticks are active each year, increasing the time that humans could be exposed to Lyme disease. Unlike some other vector-borne diseases, tick-borne disease patterns are generally less influenced by short-term changes in weather (weeks to months) than by longer-term climate change. Climate is just one of many important factors that influence the transmission, distribution, and incidence of Lyme disease. Other factors that affect the number of Lyme disease cases include changes in the populations of host species (particularly deer), which affect tick population size. The percentage of ticks that are infected depends on the prevalence and infection rates of white-footed mice and certain other hosts. Host species populations and habitats can be affected by climate change and other ecosystem disturbances. Human exposure to infected ticks is also influenced by factors such as changes in the proximity of human populations to ticks and other hosts, increased awareness of Lyme disease, and modified behaviors, such as spending less time outdoors, taking precautions against being bitten, and checking more carefully for ticks. Occupation influences exposure, as people who work outdoors, like farmers and landscapers, may be especially at risk. Lyme disease is one of many . This indicator looks at the incidence of Lyme disease, which reflects the rate of new cases contracted in a given geographic area and time period. Incidence is typically calculated as the number of cases per 100,000 people per year. Annual Lyme disease totals and rates for each state were provided by CDC. The original data were collected by state and local health departments, which track confirmed cases of Lyme disease that are diagnosed by health care providers and report these cases to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. Nationwide reporting of Lyme disease began in 1991. Figure 1 shows the national incidence of Lyme disease since 1991, and Figure 2 shows trends in incidence over time in 15 states that collectively account for about 95 percent of the nation’s reported cases. To illustrate changes in the distribution of reported cases over time, maps of the years 1996 and 2018 are presented side by side. For consistency, this indicator includes only data for confirmed cases of Lyme disease that are reported to CDC, not cases that are considered “probable.” Changes in diagnosing practices and awareness of the disease over time can affect trends. Cases are reported based on the patient’s county of residence, which is not necessarily the place where they were infected. Risk of infection is focused in certain regions of the country, and confirmed reports from low-incidence states are often the result of travel to an area of higher incidence. Evidence suggests that expanding ranges of ticks in certain northern states may be more related to a warming climate than expanding ranges in southern states. Because of the many factors affecting tick populations and reporting of Lyme disease, though, this indicator does not provide sufficient information to determine what proportion of the observed changes in Lyme disease incidence is directly driven by climate change. Further study is critical to improving the usefulness of this indicator and informing decisions affecting public health. For information on prevention, symptoms, and treatment of Lyme disease, see: . All three figures are based on publicly available Lyme disease data compiled by CDC at: . Incidence was calculated using mid-year population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau."

This indicator examines trends related to home air conditioning and heating by tracking the amount of electricity used by U.S. homes in the summer and energy used in the winter. This graph shows the amount of electricity used by the average American during the summer months (June, July, and August) of each year from 1973 to 2022. The solid line shows average summer electricity use per capita, and it represents all 50 states plus D.C. For reference, the dashed line shows the average number of cooling degree days for the same months across the contiguous 48 states plus D.C. Data sources: EIA, 2022 ; BEA, 2022 ; NOAA, 2022 This graph shows the amount of natural gas used by the average American during the winter months (December, January, and February) of each year from 1974 to 2022 (winter “1974” covers December 1973 through February 1974, and so on). The solid line shows average winter natural gas use per capita, and it represents all 50 states plus D.C. For reference, the dashed line shows the average number of heating degree days for the same months across the contiguous 48 states plus D.C. Data sources: EIA, 2022 ; BEA, 2022 ; NOAA, 2022 Hot weather can be uncomfortable, and in extreme cases dangerous (see the indicator). One way people respond to hot weather is by using air conditioning. Air conditioning is the primary way to cool a home and has become more widely used over time; as of 2015, it accounted for 17 percent of the electricity that the average American household uses every year. Conversely, cold weather requires people to use energy to heat their homes, using electricity and fuels such as natural gas, propane, and oil. As climate change contributes to an increase in average temperatures and unusually hot days, Americans are expected to use more energy—mostly electricity for air conditioning. As a result, people will likely have to spend more money on electricity for cooling. Increased use of air conditioning could also lead to more greenhouse gas emissions and further climate change, because more electricity must be generated to meet this increased demand. As of 2021, about three-fifths of the electricity in the United States was generated by burning fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas. Burning fossil fuels for electricity is one of the largest sources of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions in the United States (see the indicator). The opposite effect could take place with winter heating. As temperatures rise, Americans are expected to use less fuel energy for heating their homes. Overall, though, summer increases in energy use are expected to outweigh any reduction due to lower heating needs in the winter. Improvements in energy efficiency, particularly for electricity-based heating and cooling, can influence residential consumption and demand for energy over time. This indicator measures changes in residential seasonal energy use in the United States. It has two components: The data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), which collects comprehensive information about power generation, delivery, and sales from electric power utilities across the country. EIA has collected these data consistently since 1973. For this indicator, EPA divided total residential electricity sales for the summer months by the corresponding total U.S. population to calculate summer electricity use per capita, which Figure 1 shows in kilowatt-hours per person. EPA used a similar method with winter residential natural gas sales, which Figure 2 shows in cubic feet per person. For reference, Figure 1 also shows summer cooling for each year, while Figure 2 shows winter heating degree days for each year (see the indicator). In general, more cooling degree days and fewer heating degree days means a combination of more warm days and warmer temperatures on those days. Residential electricity and natural gas use cover all 50 states plus Washington D.C., while cooling and heating degree days are shown for the contiguous 48 states plus D.C., as they are not routinely calculated for Alaska and Hawaii. This indicator is based on residential retail electricity and natural gas sales. In the case of electricity, sales are not exactly the same as total residential electricity use, because sales data do not count electricity that people generate and consume onsite—for example, using rooftop solar panels. For context, residential solar generated an estimated 33,600 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2021, which translates to 2.3 percent of total residential retail sales. As more people produce their own power and buy less electricity from a utility, sales data could increasingly underestimate the actual amount of electricity used. However, retail sales data are still the best available approximation for energy use nationwide . Outdoor air temperature is not the only weather-related factor that influences energy use (humidity and dew point also matter, for example), but it is still a major driver of the amount of electricity and natural gas people use in their homes. That said, rising temperatures are not the only reason why people might use more electricity in the summer and less natural gas in the winter. One possible factor affecting electricity and natural gas use is where people live. Over the past several decades, the fastest-growing parts of the United States have been in the South and West, which means a growing share of the U.S. population lives in warmer places. The “cooling degree days” line in Figure 1 and the “heating degree days” line in Figure 2 adjust for where people lived as of the 2010 census but do not adjust for changes in population distribution over time. Other factors include characteristics of people’s homes and the air conditioning and heating equipment they use. As of 2020, 88 percent of U.S. homes use some type of air conditioning, and 66 percent have central air conditioning installed. These numbers have increased over time, as has the size of the average American home, which means more space to heat and cool. Conversely, homes have become more energy efficient over time (for example, through better insulation), and air conditioning and heating equipment has also become more efficient. Electricity and natural gas use could also reflect utility prices (when rates are higher, people may choose to reduce their use) and the amount of electricity and natural gas that Americans use for other needs. Other considerations include whether new homes rely on electricity or gas for cooking, water heating, and other activities, and shifts towards the use of innovative electronic appliances over time. Even with all these factors at work, many studies agree that rising temperatures can and will lead to increased use of electricity, as well as reduced use of heating fuels in winter. The data for this indicator were provided by EIA, which maintains a large collection of information about how the United States produces and uses electricity and other forms of energy. EIA’s energy sales data can be found online at: and . EPA developed this indicator using two additional sources: population data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and cooling and heating degree days from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. To determine a \"degree day,\" EPA compares the daily average outdoor temperature with a defined baseline temperature for indoor comfort (in this case, 65°F). For example, if the average temperature on a particular day is 78°F, then that day counts as 13 cooling degree days, as a building's interior would need to be cooled by 13°F to reach 65°F. If the average outdoor temperature is 34°F, then that day counts as 31 heating degree days, as a building's interior would need to be warmed by 31°F to reach 65°F."

Data source: NOAA, 2024 This map shows how the average number of heating degree days per year has changed in each state over time. The map was created by comparing the first 65 years of available data (1895–1959) with the most recent 64 years (1960–2023). “Warmer” colors indicate an increase in temperatures between the two periods, leading to less of a need to turn on the heat—that is, fewer heating degree days. “Cooler” colors indicate a decrease in temperatures, leading to more of a need to turn on the heat—that is, more heating degree days.

The map was created by comparing the first 65 years of available data (1895–1959) with the most recent 64 years (1960–2023). “Warmer” colors indicate an increase in temperatures between the two periods, leading to more demand for air conditioning—that is, more cooling degree days. “Cooler” colors indicate a decrease in temperatures, leading to less demand for air conditioning—that is, fewer cooling degree days. Click on a state to reveal the trend in a line graph. Data source: NOAA, 2024 Outdoor temperatures can affect daily life in many ways. In particular, temperature affects our health, comfort level, and demand for heating and air conditioning. Collectively, heating and cooling the spaces in which we live accounts for 52 percent of the energy that American households use every year. As climate change contributes to an increase in average temperatures, an increase in unusually hot days, and a decrease in unusually cold days (see the and indicators), the overall demand for heating is expected to decline and the demand for cooling is expected to increase. One way to measure the influence of temperature change on energy demand is using heating and cooling degree days, which measure the difference between outdoor temperatures and a temperature that people generally find comfortable indoors. These measurements suggest how much energy people might need to use to heat and cool their homes and workplaces, thus providing a sense of how climate change could affect people’s daily lives and finances. This indicator uses daily temperature data from thousands of weather stations across the United States to calculate heating and cooling degree days. A “degree day” is determined by comparing the daily average outdoor temperature with a defined baseline temperature for indoor comfort (in this case, 65°F). For example, if the average temperature on a particular day is 78°F, then that day counts as 13 cooling degree days, as a building’s interior would need to be cooled by 13°F to reach 65°F. Conversely, if the average outdoor temperature is 34°F, then that day counts as 31 heating degree days, as a building’s interior would need to be warmed by 31°F to reach 65°F. This does not mean that all people will actually heat or cool buildings to 65°F; it is just a number to allow for consistent comparisons over time and across the country. For reference, New York City experiences far more heating degree days than cooling degree days per year—a reflection of the relatively cool climate in the Northeast—while Houston, Texas, has far more cooling degree days than heating degree days—a reflection of the much warmer climate in the South. Figure 1 shows each year’s average heating and cooling degree days across the contiguous 48 states. Figures 2 and 3 show how heating and cooling degree days have changed by state, based on a comparison of the first 65 years of available data (1895–1959) with the most recent 64 years (1960–2023). State and national averages were calculated by finding the total number of heating and cooling degree days per year at each weather station, averaging the results from all stations within regions called climate divisions (each state within the contiguous 48 has up to 10 climate divisions), then calculating state and national averages weighted by the population of each climate division. With this population-weighting approach, average state and national heating and cooling degree days more closely reflect the conditions that the average resident would experience. Heating and cooling degree days suggest how temperature changes affect energy demand, but they do not necessarily reflect actual energy use. Many other factors have influenced energy demand over time, such as more energy-efficient heating systems, the introduction and increasingly widespread use of cooling technologies, larger but better-insulated homes, behavior change, and population shifts (such as more people moving to warmer regions). All of the population-weighting in this indicator is based on the population distribution according to the 2010 U.S. Census, so any changes in heating and cooling degree days over time in this indicator reflect actual changes in the climate, not the influence of shifting populations. A nationally applied baseline—in this case, 65°F—has certain limitations considering the various climate zones across the United States. The data for this indicator were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, which maintains climate data online at: ."

This indicator presents data on deaths classified as “cold-related” in the United States. This figure shows the annual rates for deaths classified as “cold-related” by medical professionals in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The orange line shows deaths for which cold was listed as the main (underlying) cause.* The blue line shows deaths for which cold was listed as either the underlying or contributing cause of death, based on a broader set of data that became available in 1999. * Between 1998 and 1999, the World Health Organization revised the international codes used to classify causes of death. As a result, data from earlier than 1999 cannot easily be compared with data from 1999 and later. Data source: CDC, 2018 In recent years, U.S. death rates in winter months have been 8 to 12 percent higher than in non-winter months. Much of this increase relates to seasonal changes in behavior and the human body, as well as increased exposure to respiratory diseases. Cold temperatures can also worsen pre-existing medical conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. For example, death rates from heart attacks increase as temperatures drop, likely due to the way cold affects blood circulation, blood vessels, and other factors. Even moderately cold days can increase the risk of death for many people. People exposed to extremely cold conditions can also suffer from direct effects such as frostbite and potentially deadly hypothermia, especially in places where people are not accustomed to cold temperatures. Certain population groups face higher risks of cold-related illness or death. For example, occupational groups that work outdoors during winter months, such as agricultural workers, construction workers, and electricity and pipeline utility workers, face higher risks of exposure to cold. Others at risk include older adults, infants, people with pre-existing medical conditions, people taking medications or using drugs (especially alcohol) that make them more susceptible to cold effects, homeless people, and those with inadequate winter clothing or home heating. Unusually cold winter temperatures have become less common across the contiguous 48 states in recent decades, particularly very cold nights (see the indicator). Extreme cold waves are likely to continue to decrease as winter temperatures increase in the future. This winter warming is expected to reduce the number of direct cold-related deaths, but the decrease is projected to be smaller than increases in heat-related deaths (see the indicator) in most regions. This is because some of the factors that lead to higher death rates in the winter are not particularly sensitive to climate change, because extreme heat has a more immediate and direct effect on death rates than extreme cold, and because the solutions to protect against cold exposure (such as staying indoors, wearing more clothing, turning on the heat) are more widely accessible than protection against extreme heat. Cold-related death rates can change as communities strengthen their cold weather plans and take other steps to protect vulnerable people during cold winter months. Like the indicator, this indicator shows the annual rate for deaths classified by medical professionals as “cold-related” in the United States based on death certificate records. Every death is recorded on a death certificate, where a medical professional identifies the main cause of death (also known as the underlying cause), along with other conditions that contributed to the death. These causes are classified using a set of standard codes. Dividing the annual number of deaths by the U.S. population in that year, then multiplying by one million, will result in the death rates (per million people) that this indicator shows. Figure 1 shows cold-related death rates using two methods. One method shows deaths for which exposure to excessive natural cold was stated as the underlying cause of death from 1979 to 2016. The other data series shows deaths for which cold was listed as either the underlying cause or a contributing cause, based on a broader set of data that, at present, can only be evaluated for the years 1999 to 2015. For example, in a case where cardiovascular disease was determined to be the underlying cause of death, cold could be listed as a contributing factor because it can make the individual more susceptible to the effects of this disease. Several factors influence the ability of this indicator to estimate the true number of deaths associated with exposure to cold temperatures. Some cold-related deaths are not identified as such by the medical examiner and might not be properly coded on the death certificate. In many cases, the medical examiner might classify the cause of death as a cardiovascular or respiratory disease, not knowing for certain whether cold was a contributing factor. Furthermore, deaths can occur from exposure to cold (either as an underlying cause or as a contributing factor) that is not classified as extreme and therefore is often not recorded as such. These factors are similar to the factors that likely lead to undercounting of heat-related deaths (see the Heat-Related Deaths indicator), except that the effects of cold on the body tend to persist for longer than the effects of heat, which could make it even more difficult to connect deaths to exposures. Classifying a death as “cold-related” does not mean that cold temperatures were the only factor that caused or contributed to the death, as pre-existing medical conditions can significantly increase an individual’s susceptibility to cold temperatures. Other important factors, such as the overall vulnerability of the population, and the extent to which people have adapted and acclimated to cold temperatures, can also affect trends in cold-related deaths. Some deaths classified as “cold-related” reflect human behavior more than weather conditions—for instance, deaths in which alcohol abuse increased a person's susceptibility to cold weather, falling into cold water (which can cause hypothermia, even in non-winter months), or getting lost on a wilderness excursion. This indicator includes these types of deaths. Data for this indicator were provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The 1979–2016 underlying cause data in Figure 1 are publicly available through the CDC WONDER database at: . The 1999–2015 analysis in Figure 1 was developed by using data provided by CDC’s Environmental Public Health Tracking Program."

This indicator tracks how often people are hospitalized because of exposure to heat. This graph shows the annual rate of hospitalizations classified as “heat-related” by medical professionals in 20 states that participate in CDC’s hospitalization tracking program, from 2001 to 2010. The rate is based on hospital discharge records for May 1 to September 30 of every year. The rate has been age-adjusted to account for the effects of population change over time—for example, if the proportion of older adults has increased. Data source: Choudhary and Vaidyanathan, 2014 This map shows the 2001–2010 average rate of hospitalizations classified as “heat-related” by medical professionals in 23 states that participate in CDC’s hospitalization tracking program. Rates are based on hospital discharge records for May 1 to September 30 of every year. Rates have been age-adjusted to account for differences in the population distribution over time and between states—for example, if one state has a higher proportion of older adults than another. Data source: CDC, 2016 This graph shows the total number of hospitalizations classified as “heat-related” by medical professionals in 20 states that participate in CDC’s hospitalization tracking program, from 2001 to 2010. Totals are broken out by sex and by age group. The graph shows 10-year totals based on hospital discharge records for May 1 to September 30 of every year. Data source: Choudhary and Vaidyanathan, 2014 Heat-related illnesses can occur when a person is exposed to high temperatures, such that their body cannot cool itself sufficiently through sweating. Symptoms range from mild swelling, rashes, or cramps to potentially deadly heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States (see the indicator), and it causes many people to visit the emergency room or be admitted to the hospital. Any person can suffer from heat stress, regardless of age, sex, or health status. Older adults and children, however, have a higher-than-average risk of becoming ill due to exposure to extreme heat. People working outdoors, the socially isolated and economically disadvantaged, those with chronic illnesses, and some communities of color are also especially vulnerable to heat. Unusually hot summer temperatures have become more common across the contiguous 48 states in recent decades (see the indicator), and extreme heat events (heat waves) are expected to become more frequent and more intense in the future. As a result, the risk of heat-related illness is expected to increase. Hospitalization rates can also change, however, as people acclimate to higher temperatures and as communities strengthen their heat response plans and take other steps to continue to adapt. This indicator shows hospitalization rates for “heat-related” illnesses such as heat exhaustion, heat cramps, mild heat edema (swelling in the legs and hands), heat syncope (fainting), and heat stroke. It is based on hospital discharge records for patients who are admitted to the hospital for 23 hours or more. Every discharge record includes a diagnosis determined by a physician or other medical professional. This indicator covers states across a wide range of regions and climate zones that have participated in a national hospital data tracking program since at least 2001. All of these states require hospitals to submit discharge data to a state organization, which then compiles and reports the data to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dividing the annual number of hospitalizations by the corresponding state population, then multiplying by 100,000, gives the hospitalization rates (per 100,000 people) shown in this indicator. Figure 1 shows annual hospitalization rates, averaged over a group of 20 states. Figure 2 shows state-specific rates for 23 states, averaged over the period from 2001 to 2010. Figure 3 shows the total number of hospitalizations across the same 20 states shown in Figure 1, broken out by sex and by age group. Because excessive heat events are associated with summer months, this indicator is limited to hospitalizations occurring in May through September. Reporting of illnesses and processing of records can involve a time lag of several years, so this indicator currently only shows data through 2010. Several factors influence this indicator’s ability to estimate the true number of hospitalizations associated with extreme heat events: the indicator is limited to a subset of states; it uses records that have only been collected comprehensively since 2001; it relies on the judgment of thousands of individual medical professionals to accurately diagnose and explicitly document heat-related illnesses; and it assumes that hospitals fulfill their state-mandated reporting obligations. Nonetheless, this data set represents the best available source of observed data for tracking heat-related hospitalizations across multiple states. Focusing exclusively on the months from May 1 to September 30 may help to exclude incorrect reports, but it could also exclude legitimate heat-related illnesses that occur in other months. Hospitals’ practice of recording heat stress as a diagnosis does not signify that high temperatures are the only factor that causes or contributes to a hospitalization. Pre-existing medical conditions can significantly increase an individual’s vulnerability to heat. Other important factors, such as the overall vulnerability of the population, the extent to which people have adapted and acclimated to higher temperatures, and the local climate and topography, can affect trends in “heat-related” hospitalizations. Heat response measures, such as early warning and surveillance systems, air conditioning, health care, public education, cooling centers, infrastructure standards, and air quality management, can also make a big difference in heat-related hospitalization rates. Data for this indicator were provided by CDC. This analysis was developed by CDC’s Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, which publishes state-level hospitalization data online at: ."

This feature presents data on worker deaths classified as “heat-related” in the United States and explores factors that influence exposure and vulnerability to heat. This graph shows the number of reported occupational heat-related deaths in the United States each year. The blue portions of the bars show deaths in the construction sector and the orange portions show deaths in all other sectors of the economy. The dashed lines indicate when BLS changed how it classifies “construction” (1996/1997 and 2002/2003) or changed its thresholds for reporting individual industry totals (2018/2019). Total construction sector deaths in 2019 fell below the new threshold; for that year, BLS combined construction into a single “all-industry” total rather than reporting a sector total. BLS has indicated that data collection for 2020 fell below reporting thresholds. Data source: BLS, 2024 This map shows the percentage of each county’s workforce engaged in occupations that typically involve a substantial amount of time outdoors. Job categories included in this analysis include delivery services, law enforcement and emergency services, utilities, mining/quarrying/oil and gas extraction, agriculture, fishing, forestry, and construction. The map shows a five-year average. Data source: BLS, 2024 Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States (see the indicator). Over the last few decades, unusually hot summer days and nights have become more common across the contiguous 48 states (see the indicator) and it is expected that extreme heat events will occur with greater frequency and intensity in the future. Thus, heat-related deaths are also expected to increase, although these increases may be tempered as people physiologically adapt to higher temperatures and as communities increase their resilience to heat. Outdoor workers, particularly those engaging in strenuous physical activity, disproportionately face greater heat-related health threats. For example, construction workers represent only 6 percent of the total U.S. workforce, yet they account for more than one-third of all reported occupational deaths associated with heat exposure. Farmworkers also have disproportionately high rates of heat-related illnesses and deaths. Worker safety and productivity will likely be increasingly challenged as temperatures outdoors continue to rise. To reduce risks, employers can implement preventative measures such as ensuring access to water, training workers to recognize signs of heat-related illnesses, mandating frequent breaks and shade, providing heat-appropriate protective equipment, and limiting work during the hottest times of day. Several states have enacted rules to mandate these types of practices, as tracked by organizations like the . For more information, see the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA’s) worker safety website: and: . This feature tracks the number of workers who died as a result of heat exposure on the job in the United States from 1992 to 2022. These data are compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) from multiple sources. Many of these cases are tracked by OSHA, which requires all employers under its jurisdiction to report any work-related death. Additional information comes from other federal agencies (including the military), state agencies, death certificates and autopsy reports, and other corroborating evidence. The cause of death and other details about each fatal incident are transcribed and coded using standardized classification systems. This feature focuses on cases whose “source of injury” was coded as “Heat—environmental”: that is, deaths caused by high temperatures that occur indoors or outdoors. Figure 1 shows the total number of heat-related deaths per year. It also shows the number of deaths specific to the construction sector, which is consistently the sector with the most heat-related deaths. Highlighting the intersections of climate hazards, such as extreme heat, and social vulnerability can help identify people and places most at risk. Outdoor workers, particularly those engaging in strenuous physical activity, disproportionately face heat-related health threats. Between 5 million and 10 million American workers are exposed to outdoor heat beyond safe levels every year. Outdoor occupations are distributed throughout the United States, and they make up an especially large percentage of the workforce in certain regions (Example 1), including parts of the West, northern and southern Great Plains, and Alaska. Outdoor workers in cities may also be exposed to elevated temperatures due to the , which can increase temperatures by 18 to 27°F during the day and 9 to 18°F at night in urban areas compared with outlying areas. This feature counts deaths in workplaces of all types and sizes. It is not limited to establishments that fall under the jurisdiction of OSHA or other specific agencies. Several factors influence the ability of this feature to estimate the true number of occupational heat-related deaths. As discussed in the indicator, deaths classified as heat-related may have other important contributing causes. Conversely, deaths associated with extreme heat are not always reported as such. Unlike the Heat-Related Deaths indicator, though, this feature is based on many types of corroborating evidence in addition to death certificates. A fraction of deaths may go unreported by employers, may not be properly categorized as heat-related, or may not be attributed to an occupational cause if the death occurs off the job site (for example, after the employee has left work for the day). The underreporting rate is believed to be larger in industries that tend to have more undocumented or short-term workers. This feature uses death counts rather than death rates. Reporting the total number of deaths per year is useful for communication because it puts the exact number of lives in perspective, but it does not account for changes over time in population or sector-specific employment. Improvements to the tracking of worker-related fatalities include standardization of employer and state reporting of work-related heat deaths. Reporting of illnesses and injuries must be immediate to ensure that illnesses and deaths are not mis-classified or missed altogether. Data for this feature were provided by BLS. The data in Figure 1 are publicly available on the BLS Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities website at: .

This graph presents summer (May to September) death rates from 1999 to 2022 for three population groups in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The blue line shows rates for the entire population, the green line shows rates for non-Hispanic Black people, and the pink line shows rates for people aged 65 and older. Data source: CDC, 2024 Many factors can influence the nature, extent, and timing of health consequences associated with extreme heat events. Studies of heat waves are one way to better understand health impacts, but different methods can lead to very different estimates of heat-related deaths. For example, during a severe heat wave that hit Chicago* between July 11 and July 27, 1995, 465 heat-related deaths were recorded on death certificates in Cook County. However, studies that compared the total number of deaths during this heat wave (regardless of the recorded cause of death) with the long-term average of daily deaths found that the heat wave likely led to about 700 more deaths than would otherwise have been expected. Differences in estimated heat-related deaths that result from different methods may be even larger when considering the entire nation and longer time periods. * This graph shows data for the Chicago Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. Data sources: CDC, 2012; NOAA, 2012 When people are exposed to extreme heat, they can suffer from potentially deadly illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Hot temperatures can also contribute to deaths from heart attacks, strokes, and other forms of cardiovascular disease. According to the , heat is a leading weather-related killer in the United States, even though most heat-related deaths are preventable through outreach and intervention (see EPA’s at: ). Unusually hot temperatures have become more common across parts of the United States in recent decades (see the indicator), extreme heat events (heat waves) have become more frequent and intense throughout the country (see the indicator), and these trends are expected to continue. As a result, the risk of heat-related deaths and illness is also expected to increase unless people take steps to mitigate the impact or adapt. The “heat island” effect accentuates the problem by causing even higher temperatures in densely developed urban areas. Reductions in cold-related deaths are projected to be smaller than increases in heat-related deaths in most regions. Death rates can also change, however, as people acclimate to higher temperatures and as communities strengthen their heat response plans and take other steps to continue to adapt Certain population groups already face higher risks of heat-related death and increases in summertime temperature variability will increase that risk. The population of adults aged 65 and older, which is expected to continue to grow, has a higher-than-average risk of heat-related death. Children are particularly vulnerable to heat-related illness and death, as their bodies are less able to adapt to heat than adults, and they must rely on others to help keep them safe. People with certain diseases, such as cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, are especially vulnerable to excessive heat exposure, as are the economically disadvantaged. Data also suggest a higher risk among non-Hispanic Black people. This indicator shows the annual rate for deaths classified by medical professionals as “heat-related” in the United States based on death certificate records. Every death is recorded on a death certificate, where a medical professional identifies the main cause of death (also known as the underlying cause), along with other conditions that contributed to the death. These causes are classified using a set of standard codes. Dividing the annual number of deaths by the U.S. population in that year, then multiplying by one million, will result in the death rates (per million people) that this indicator shows. Figure 1 shows heat-related death rates using two methods. One method shows deaths for which excessive natural heat was stated as the underlying cause of death from 1979 to 2022. The other data series shows deaths for which heat was listed as either the underlying cause or a contributing cause, based on a broader set of data that, at present, can only be evaluated from 1999 to 2021. For example, in a case where cardiovascular disease was determined to be the underlying cause of death, heat could be listed as a contributing factor because it can make the individual more susceptible to the effects of this disease. Because excessive heat events are associated with summer months, the contributing factor analysis was limited to May through September. Figure 2 offers a closer look at cardiovascular disease deaths for which heat was recorded as a contributing cause. This graph includes deaths due to heart attacks, strokes, and other diseases related to the circulatory system. Figure 2 shows death rates for the overall population as well as two groups with a higher risk: people age 65 and older and non-Hispanic Black people. Like the “underlying and contributing causes” analysis in Figure 1, Figure 2 is restricted to the summer months, and it uses data that are available from 1999 to 2022. Several factors influence the ability of this indicator to estimate the true number of deaths associated with extreme heat events. It has been well documented that many deaths associated with extreme heat are not identified as such by the medical examiner and might not be properly coded on the death certificate. In many cases, the medical examiner might classify the cause of death as a cardiovascular or respiratory disease, not knowing for certain whether heat was a contributing factor, particularly if the death did not occur during a well-publicized heat wave. Furthermore, deaths can occur from exposure to heat (either as an underlying cause or as a contributing factor) that is not classified as extreme and therefore is often not recorded as such. Some statistical approaches estimate that more than 1,300 deaths per year in the United States are due to extreme heat, compared with about 750 deaths per year in the “underlying and contributing causes” data set shown in Figure 1. By studying how daily death rates vary with temperature in selected cities, scientists have found that extreme heat contributes to far more deaths than the official death certificates might suggest. This is because the stress of a hot day can increase the chance of dying from a heart attack, other heart conditions, or respiratory diseases such as pneumonia. These causes of death are much more common overall than dying directly from a heat-related illness such as heat stroke. Thus, this indicator very likely underestimates the number of deaths caused by exposure to heat. Classifying a death as “heat-related” does not mean that high temperatures were the only factor that caused or contributed to the death, as pre-existing medical conditions can significantly increase an individual’s susceptibility to heat. Other important factors, such as the overall vulnerability of the population, the extent to which people have adapted and acclimated to higher temperatures, and the local climate and topography, can affect trends in heat-related deaths. Heat response measures, such as early warning and surveillance systems, air conditioning, health care, public education, cooling centers, infrastructure standards, and air quality management, can also make a big difference in reducing death rates. For example, after a 1995 heat wave, the city of Milwaukee developed a plan for responding to extreme heat conditions; during a 1999 heat wave, heat-related deaths were roughly half of what would have been expected. Future development related to this indicator should focus on capturing heat-related deaths, not just those with a reported link to heat stress. Starting in 2018, the source data began to provide separate counts for people who belong to more than one racial group. Prior to 2018, some of these individuals might have been classified as Black. This change has a small effect on the “non-Hispanic Black people” data in Figure 2, but not enough to change the shape of the line or the conclusions that can be drawn. The technical documentation for this indicator explains the change in more detail. Data for this indicator were provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The underlying cause data in Figure 1 are publicly available through the CDC WONDER database at: . The contributing factor analysis in Figure 1 was developed by CDC’s Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, which provides a summary at: .

Changes in the Earth’s climate can affect public health, agriculture, water supplies, energy production and use, land use and development, and recreation. The nature and extent of these effects, and whether they will be harmful or beneficial, will vary regionally and over time. This chapter looks at some of the ways that climate change is affecting human health and society, including changes in Lyme disease, West Nile virus, ragweed pollen season, heat- and cold-related deaths and hospitalizations, heating and cooling needs, and the agricultural growing season across the United States. Because impacts on human health are complex, often indirect, and dependent on multiple societal and environmental factors (including how people respond to these impacts), the development of appropriate health-related climate indicators is challenging and still emerging. It is important for health-related climate indicators to be clear, measurable, and timely to better understand the link between climate change and health effects. Changes in climate affect the average weather conditions to which we are accustomed. These changes can result in multiple threats to human health and welfare. Warmer average temperatures will likely lead to hotter days and more frequent and longer heat waves, which could increase the number of heat-related illnesses and deaths. Increases in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events, such as storms, could increase the risk of dangerous flooding, high winds, and other direct threats to people and property. Warmer temperatures could also reduce air quality by increasing the chemical reactions that produce smog, and, along with changes in precipitation patterns and extreme events, could enhance the spread of some diseases. In addition, climate change could require adaptation on larger and faster scales than in the past, presenting challenges to human well-being and the economy. The more extensively and more rapidly the climate changes, the larger the potential effects on society. The extent to which climate change will affect different regions and sectors of society will depend not only on the sensitivity of those systems to climate change, but also on their ability to adapt to or cope with climate change. Populations of particular concern include the poor, the elderly, those already in poor health, the disabled, and indigenous populations."

This indicator tracks the number of days the U.S. and North American landscape is not frozen. This figure shows the number of days the ground is considered unfrozen in the contiguous 48 states compared with the 1979–2021 average. For each year, the bar represents the number of days shorter or longer than average. Positive numbers represent years with more unfrozen days than average. Choosing a different long-term average for comparison would not change the shape of the data over time. Data source: Kim and Kimball, 2022 This figure shows the number of days the ground is considered unfrozen in Alaska compared with the 1979–2021 average. For each year, the bar represents the number of days shorter or longer than average. Positive numbers represent years with more unfrozen days than average. Choosing a different long-term average for comparison would not change the shape of the data over time. Data source: Kim and Kimball, 2022 This map of North America shows where the number of annual unfrozen days either increased or decreased from 1979 to 2021. Colors show total change over this 42-year period, based on the long-term average rate of change. Dark gray areas were not included in this analysis because they are either open water, barren land, permanently frozen (glaciers, for example), or land that almost never freezes. Data source: Kim and Kimball, 2022 The freezing point (32°F) is a critical temperature threshold for many aspects of life. The number and timing of days with temperatures below freezing affect ecosystems and many sectors of the economy. For example, many crops only grow during periods when they are not limited by frost damage. The number of days below freezing during a year determines which plants can thrive, what food sources are available for animals, and when and how animals migrate or hibernate. Freezing temperatures also help reduce populations of certain insects and other pests that can damage crops and forests or spread diseases to humans (see the indicator, for example); conversely, a mild winter with fewer days of frost can lead to more of these pests during the following spring and summer. Temperatures below freezing also allow precipitation to fall as snow rather than rain (see the indicator), which is important for regional water supplies and for places where winter activities, like skiing and snowmobiling, are an important part of the economy. Regional temperature conditions also drive the freezing and thawing of lakes and rivers (see and , for example). As the Earth’s climate warms overall (see the indicator), the number of days below freezing has decreased in most parts of the United States. Continued reduction in frozen days could lead to a variety of effects on ecosystems, drought, wildfire risk, agriculture, natural resources, and the economy. This indicator tracks the total number of unfrozen days per year in the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. Here, a “frozen day” is any day in which frozen conditions are present at ground level in both morning and evening. An “unfrozen day” is the opposite. The indicator is based on satellite measurements that detect whether the land surface is frozen. For a broader perspective, it also shows results in a map for North America. It is complementary to EPA’s indicator, but rather than relying on temperature thresholds, it offers a unique perspective based on ecologically relevant physical changes from different data sources and calculations. This indicator focuses on whether the landscape itself is frozen (i.e., frozen conditions are present at ground level), and it counts all frozen or unfrozen days throughout the year. In contrast, the growing season indicator is based on air temperatures and it focuses on one continuous stretch of days between the last frost of spring and the first frost of fall. This indicator was developed by dividing the country into a grid with thousands of cells, using satellite measurements to calculate the number of unfrozen days in each cell for every year, and then averaging all the grid cells together. Figures 1 and 2 show annual averages for the contiguous 48 states and Alaska, respectively. These graphs compare the number of unfrozen days per year against the 1979–2021 long-term average. Figure 3 shows how the annual average change for this period looks geographically. The calculations for this indicator include all land areas that experience freeze-thaw cycles that affect plant life—which means it does not cover areas that are permanently frozen, areas that never freeze, land with no plant life, or large bodies of water. At any given location, the number of days experiencing frozen conditions varies from year to year as a result of normal variation in weather patterns. With more than four decades of data, though, variability should not affect the conclusions that can be inferred from the long-term trends shown in this indicator. A decline in frozen conditions does not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in agricultural productivity. This is because plant productivity also depends on plant-specific temperature thresholds (some yields go down if temperatures get too warm), pollinators, and seasonal limitations in water and nutrient availability. Agricultural production also depends on management activities (e.g., choice of crop varieties suited to changing climate conditions, timing of planting, irrigation, pesticide and fertilizer applications) and natural weather events, such as storms. This indicator differs from EPA’s indicator because it is based on satellite data rather than on-the-ground weather stations, and because it counts the total number of unfrozen days throughout the year—not just the stretch of consecutive days between the last spring frost and the first fall frost. Both indicators are useful for different reasons: growing season is especially meaningful for agricultural crops, while a broader look at frozen conditions is important for understanding ecological impacts, including biological and hydrological processes. In addition, the satellite method used here can pick up local variations in areas that might not have many long-term weather stations that measure air temperature. The two indicators show similar patterns, which is consistent with multiple lines of evidence pointing to similar conclusions about the nation’s changing climate. This indicator is based on data collected by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellites and analyzed by the University of Montana. EPA’s indicator is an updated version of an analysis originally published in the scientific literature in 2017."

This indicator shows trends in permafrost temperature at select sites in Alaska. This figure shows permafrost temperature at borehole sites in interior and northern Alaska, measured at the end of summer (approximately September of each year). Measurements at these sites were taken at depths between 49 and 85 feet. Data source: University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2023 This map shows the change in permafrost temperature per decade for long-term borehole sites in Alaska. Larger circles correspond to greater rates of warming per decade. The blue circle represents a cooling trend. Borehole measurement depths range from 49 to 85 feet. Data source: University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2023 Permafrost is defined as rock or soil that remains at or below the freezing point of 32°F for two or more years. Permafrost usually lies below an “active layer” of ground that freezes and thaws every year with seasonal changes in temperature. Permafrost occurs in many different forms with various amounts of ice (continuous and discontinuous) and is mainly found in areas near the Arctic. In Alaska, about 80 percent of the ground has permafrost underneath it. A key characteristic affecting the state of permafrost is the temperature at the ground surface and shallow depths. The seasonal timing, amount, and extent of snow cover (see the indicator) also affect permafrost. A warming climate has brought higher temperatures to Alaska and other areas with permafrost, causing some permafrost to thaw. While the impacts of climate change on permafrost vary at regional and local scales, permafrost thawing has been observed in many locations around the world. A thawing permafrost layer can lead to severe impacts on people and the environment. For instance, as ice-filled permafrost thaws, it can turn into a muddy slurry that cannot support the weight of the soil and vegetation above it. Infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and pipes could be damaged as permafrost thaws. Infrastructure damage and erosion, due in part to permafrost thaw, has already caused some communities in western and southern Alaska to have to relocate. Additionally, organic matter (like the remains of plants) currently frozen in the permafrost will start to decompose when the ground thaws, resulting in the emission of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This contributes to further global climate change. For more than 40 years, a group of scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks has been studying permafrost across Alaska. They measure temperature every year in 15 boreholes drilled at least 50 feet deep and analyze the data for long-term trends. This data set provides valuable information about how rapid climate changes observed in Alaska are influencing permafrost. Because permafrost temperatures can also be influenced by land use change such as urban development, agriculture, and other human activities, this indicator focuses on a select set of boreholes that are relatively remote and undisturbed for better assessment of changes associated with climate. Figure 1 shows temperature measurements for each borehole site in the interior and northern Alaska regions. Figure 2 shows the long-term rate of permafrost temperature change per decade, for all boreholes. Some borehole sites used in this indicator rely on data collected at depths less than 65 feet, which may be influenced by seasonal or short-term surface temperature change. Additionally, some sites were not measured every year, creating gaps of two to four years, but all the sites included in this indicator meet minimum data completeness required for long-term change calculation. Logistical issues caused minor fluctuation in the exact timing of when measurements were collected each year, which could also add some uncertainty to the results. This collection of sites is not necessarily representative of all types of permafrost or all temperature trends throughout Alaska. Permafrost temperature can vary depending on local environmental factors such as soil type, vegetation characteristics, and snow cover depth. Notably, permafrost in northern Alaska is naturally colder and more continuous than permafrost in the interior region. The data in this indicator are based on seasonal measurements collected by researchers and provided by Dr. Vladimir Romanovsky of the Permafrost Laboratory of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Borehole temperature data are made publicly available along with corresponding metadata at: . This data set has been used and published as part of peer-reviewed journal articles on observed changes in regional and global permafrost. Native names for borehole sites were identified at: and: ."

This indicator measures trends in the amount and timing of snowpack in the western United States. This map shows trends in April snowpack in the western United States, measured in terms of snow water equivalent. Blue circles represent increased snowpack; red circles represent a decrease. Data source: USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2024 This map shows trends in the date during the year when snowpack reaches its maximum amount across the western United States. Blue triangles represent a shift to later timing; red triangles represent a shift to earlier timing. Data source: USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2023 This graph shows trends in the date during the year when snowpack reaches its maximum amount across the western United States. The line in this graph represents an average of all the sites shown in Figure 2. Data source: USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2023 This map shows trends in the length of the snowpack season across the western United States, in days. Blue circles show where the season has grown longer; red circles show where it has become shorter. Data source: USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2023 Temperature and precipitation are key factors affecting snowpack, which is the amount or thickness of snow that accumulates on the ground. In a warming climate, more precipitation will be expected to fall as rain rather than snow in most areas—reducing the extent and depth of snowpack. Long-term observations across the contiguous 48 states show that nearly 80 percent of weather stations examined have experienced a decrease in the proportion of precipitation falling as snow (see the indicator). In addition, with warmer winters and springs (see the indicator), the seasonality of snowpack is also changing. Higher temperatures cause snow to melt earlier, which in turn affects the timing and availability of water. Mountain snowpack plays a key role in the water cycle in western North America, storing water in the winter when the snow falls and releasing it as runoff in spring and summer when the snow melts. Millions of people in the West depend on the melting of mountain snowpack for hydropower, irrigation, and drinking water. In most western river basins, snowpack is a larger component of water storage than human-constructed reservoirs. Continued reductions in snowpack and shifts in snowmelt are expected in the future, which will reduce hydropower production in the West. Changes in mountain snowpack can affect agriculture, winter recreation, and tourism in some areas, as well as plants and wildlife. For example, certain types of trees rely on snow for insulation from freezing temperatures, as do some animal species. In addition, fish spawning could be disrupted if changes in snowpack or snowmelt alter the timing and abundance of streamflows. (For a look at long-term trends in the timing of spring snowmelt runoff in United States, see the indicator.) Additionally, warming and earlier snowmelt accelerate the start of the wildfire season and promote more wildfire activity in the western United States and Alaska (see the indicator). Altogether, snowpack’s sensitivity to climate and its many related effects make this a valuable indicator to track. This indicator uses a measurement called snow water equivalent to determine trends in snowpack. Snow water equivalent is the amount of water contained within the snowpack at a particular location. It can be thought of as the depth of water that would result if the entire snowpack were to melt. Figure 1 shows long-term rates of change for April 1, the most frequent observation date, because it could reflect changes in precipitation, and it is extensively used for spring streamflow and water supply forecasting. Figures 2 and 3 focus on the day of each year when snowpack is at its deepest (that is, peak snowpack) to determine if it is occurring earlier or later. Figure 4 shows changes in the length of the snowpack season, representing the number of days when the ground is covered by continuous snowpack. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and other collaborators have measured snowpack since the early 1900s. In the early years of data collection, researchers measured snow water equivalent manually, but since 1980, measurements at some locations have been collected with automated instruments as part of the snow telemetry (SNOTEL) network. The long-term analysis in Figure 1 is based on data from nearly 700 permanent measurement sites in the western United States. The snowpack analysis shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4 requires daily measurements, so it uses a smaller set of 340 SNOTEL sites that have data since 1982, which is when a large number of SNOTEL devices were deployed and came online. EPA selected 1955 as a starting point for Figure 1 because many measurement sites in the Southwest were established in the early 1950s. Natural variability in the Earth’s climate means that snowpack trends may vary slightly when measured over different time periods. For example, the period from 1945 to 1955 was unusually snowy in the Northwest, so if this indicator were to start in 1945 or 1950, the Northwest would appear to show larger decreases over time. However, the general direction of the trend is the same regardless of the start date. Analysis of the peak snowpack in Figures 2, 3, and 4 is limited to automated SNOTEL stations, which results in a shorter time period and a smaller number of stations than Figure 1. These analyses are less subject to year-to-year variation than a time series based on a single date like April 1, but snowpack conditions during the first few years (in this case, the early to mid-1980s) could still have a sizable influence on the trends calculated for this indicator. Although most parts of the West have seen reductions in snowpack―consistent with overall warming trends shown in the indicator―snowfall trends may be partially influenced by non-climatic factors such as observation methods, land-use changes, and forest canopy changes. This indicator applies consistent methods to all locations, but each site naturally has unique local conditions and a unique distribution of data. For many of the areas where snowpack is increasing, studies have documented that despite general increases in temperature and precipitation, temperatures often remain below the freezing point, resulting in more snowfall. Data for this indicator came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service Water and Climate Center. The April 1 trend analysis for this indicator was constructed using methods consistent with Mote et al. (2005) and Mote et al. (2018), the peak snowpack analysis was adapted from work by Evan (2019), and snowpack season length was calculated using methods from Petersky and Harpold (2018).

This indicator measures the amount of land in North America that is covered by snow. This graph shows the average area covered by snow in a given calendar year, based on an analysis of weekly maps. The area is measured in square miles. These data cover all of North America (not including Greenland). Data source: Rutgers University Global Snow Lab, 2021 This graph shows the average area covered by snow during spring (March–May), summer (June–August), fall (September–November), and winter (December–February), based on an analysis of weekly maps. The area is measured in square miles. These data cover all of North America (not including Greenland). Data source: Rutgers University Global Snow Lab, 2011 This figure shows the timing of each year’s snow cover season in the contiguous 48 states and Alaska, based on an average of all parts of the country that receive snow every year. The shaded band spans from the first date of snow cover until the last date of snow cover. Data source: NOAA, 2015 \"Snow cover\" refers to the amount of land covered by snow at any given time. Naturally, it is influenced by the amount of precipitation that falls as snow. Air temperature also plays a role because it determines whether precipitation falls as snow or rain, and it affects the rate at which snow on the ground melts. As temperature and precipitation patterns change, so can the overall area covered by snow. Snow cover is not just something that is affected by climate change; it also exerts an influence on climate. Because snow is white, it absorbs only a small portion of the sunlight that hits it (10 to 20 percent in the case of fresh snow) and reflects the rest back to space. In contrast, darker surfaces such as bare ground and open water absorb the majority of the energy they receive and heat up more quickly. In this way, the overall amount of snow cover affects patterns of heating and cooling over the Earth’s surface. More snow means more energy reflects back to space, resulting in cooling, while less snow cover means more energy is absorbed at the Earth’s surface, resulting in warming. On a more local scale, snow cover is important for many plants and animals. For example, some plants and animals rely on a protective blanket of snow to insulate them from sub-freezing winter temperatures. Humans and ecosystems also rely on snowmelt to replenish streams and groundwater. Snow cover also keeps the soil moist, so if the snow melts away earlier in the spring, the soil may dry out sooner, which can stress plants and increase the risk of wildfire. This indicator tracks the area covered by snow since 1972, based on maps generated by analyzing satellite images collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figure 1 was created by analyzing weekly maps to determine the total extent of snow cover, then averaging the weekly observations together to get a value for each year. Figure 2 uses the same method, but with average snow cover calculated for each season: spring (defined as March–May), summer (June–August), fall (September–November), and winter (December–February). These two figures cover all of North America, not including Greenland. Figure 3 focuses on the contiguous 48 states plus Alaska. It shows the average date when snow first starts to cover the ground in the fall, the average last date of snow cover in the spring, and the length of time between them. These snow cover season dates have been averaged over all parts of the country that regularly receive snow. Although satellite-based snow cover maps are available starting in the mid-1960s, some of the early years are missing data from several weeks during the summer, which would lead to an inaccurate annual average. Thus, the indicator is restricted to 1972 and later, with all years having a full set of data.

This feature examines the timing of spring river ice breakup in three communities that have kept detailed records for more than 100 years. This figure shows the date each year when ice breaks up at three locations: the town of Nenana on the Tanana River, Dawson City on the Yukon River, and Bethel on the Kuskokwim River. The annual data for each river have been plotted using a nine-year moving average. Data sources: Nenana Ice Classic, 2022; Yukon River Breakup, 2022; Kuskokwim Ice Classic, 2022; National Weather Service, 2022 Regions in the far north such as Alaska are warming more quickly than other parts of the world, and this pattern is expected to continue (see the indicator; for more information about regional temperature changes, see the indicator). The Tanana, Yukon, and Kuskokwim rivers in Alaska provide a particularly noteworthy record of northern climate. For a century or more, local citizens have recorded the date when the ice on these rivers starts to move or break up each spring. In fact, some towns have annual competitions to guess when ice breakup will occur. Since 1917, the Nenana Ice Classic competition on the Tanana River in central Alaska has paid several million dollars in winnings to the people who come closest to guessing the exact date and time of day when the river ice will break up. Similar traditions exist on the Kuskokwim River in Bethel, where breakup dates have been recorded since 1924, and in Dawson City on the Yukon River, just across the border in Canada, where breakup dates have been recorded since 1896. River ice breakup is more than just a friendly competition, though. Ice breakup is an important time of transition for communities that rely on these relatively remote and free-flowing wild rivers for transportation, subsistence hunting and fishing, and other needs. In addition, early thawing can lead to severe ice movement, jamming, damage to infrastructure, and destructive floods. The data collected by these communities highlight how the river ice breakup dates in Nenana, Dawson City, and Bethel have changed over time. The towns all use the same method to measure the date and time of river ice breakup. Residents place a tripod on the ice in the center of the river. This tripod is attached by a cable to a clock on the shore. When the ice under the tripod breaks or starts to move, the tripod moves, pulling the cable and stopping the clock. For this and other examples of community connections to observed climate-related changes, see the StoryMap at: . Besides climate change, natural year-to-year variations and other factors, such as local development and land-use patterns, can influence ice breakup dates. The three locations featured here are relatively remote and undeveloped, so the ice breakup dates are more likely to reflect natural changes in weather and climate conditions. However, corresponding measurements of water conditions and air temperature are useful to help understand the connection between changes in river ice breakup and changes in climate. A recent comparison with satellite measurements of freeze/thaw conditions at ground level (basically a way of measuring surface temperature) showed a close correlation between regional temperature conditions and actual Tanana River breakup dates. Ice breakup dates for the Tanana River at Nenana, the Yukon River at Dawson City, and the Kuskokwim River at Bethel have been recorded and made publicly available as part of three long-running community competitions: the Nenana Ice Classic, the Yukon River Breakup, and the Kuskokwim Ice Classic.

This indicator uses two different measures to show how snowfall has changed in the contiguous 48 states. This figure shows the average rate of change in total snowfall from 1930 to 2007 at 419 weather stations in the contiguous 48 states. Blue circles represent increased snowfall; red circles represent a decrease. Data source: Kunkel et al., 2009 This figure shows the percentage change in winter snow-to-precipitation ratio from 1949 to 2020 at 177 weather stations in the contiguous 48 states. This ratio measures what percentage of total winter precipitation falls in the form of snow. A decrease (red circle) indicates that more precipitation is falling in the form of rain instead of snow. Solid-color circles represent stations where the trend was statistically significant. Data source: NOAA, 2021 Snowfall is an important aspect of winter in much of the United States. Many people depend on spring snowmelt to provide their drinking water and support other uses such as irrigation, especially in the western United States, where snowmelt provides 75 percent of the water supply. Many communities also rely on snow for winter recreation. Some plants and animals also depend on snow and snowmelt for survival. The amount of snow that falls in a particular area directly influences both snow cover and snowpack, which refer to snow that accumulates on the ground (see the indicator and the indicator). Warmer temperatures cause more water to evaporate from the land and oceans, which leads to more precipitation, larger storms, and more variation in precipitation in some areas. In general, a warmer climate causes more of this precipitation to fall in the form of rain instead of snow. Some places, however, could see more snowfall if temperatures rise but still remain below the freezing point, or if storm tracks change. Areas near large lakes might also experience more snowfall as lakes remain unfrozen for longer periods, allowing more water to evaporate. In contrast, other areas might experience less snowfall as a result of wintertime droughts. Changes in the amount and timing of snowfall could affect the spawning of fish in the spring and the amount of water available for people to use in the spring and summer. Changes in snowfall could also affect winter recreation activities, like skiing, and the communities that rely on these activities. This indicator tracks total snowfall as well as the percentage of precipitation that falls in the form of snow versus rain. These data were collected from hundreds of weather stations across the contiguous 48 states. Total snowfall is determined by the height of snow that accumulates each day. These measured values commonly appear in weather reports (for example, a storm that deposits 10 inches of snow). Figure 1 shows how snowfall accumulation totals changed between 1930 and 2007 at more than 400 weather stations. These stations were selected because they had high-quality data for this entire time period. EPA continues to work on identifying an appropriate method of analysis for updating this indicator. Figure 2 shows trends in the proportion of total precipitation that falls in the form of snow during each winter season. This is called the “snow-to-precipitation” ratio, and it is based on comparing the amount of snowfall with the total amount of precipitation (snow plus rain) in each year. For this comparison, snow has been converted to the equivalent amount of liquid water. These data are available from 1949 to 2020. Several factors make it difficult to measure snowfall precisely. The snow accumulations shown in Figure 1 are based on the use of measuring rods. This measurement method is subject to human error, as well as the effects of wind (drifting snow) and the surrounding environment (such as tall trees). Similarly, snow gauges for Figure 2 may catch less snow than rain because of the effects of wind. Steps have been taken, however, to limit this indicator to weather stations with the most consistent methods and the highest-quality data. As a result, some parts of the country have a higher station density than others. Both figures are limited to the winter season. Figure 1 comes from an analysis of October-to-May snowfall, while Figure 2 covers November through March. Although these months account for the vast majority of snowfall in most locations, this indicator might not represent the entire snow season in some areas.

This indicator measures the area and duration of ice cover in the Great Lakes. These graphs show the percentage of surface area in each of the Great Lakes that froze on the maximum day (the “most frozen” day) of each year since 1973. The graph at the lower right is an area-weighted average of all five lakes. Data source: NOAA, 2021 These graphs show the number of frozen days per year in each of the Great Lakes since 1973. A frozen day is defined here as a day when at least 5 percent of the lake’s surface area was covered with ice. Data source: NOAA, 2021 This map shows the average annual rate of change in the duration of ice cover in the Great Lakes from 1973 to 2019. Duration is measured as the number of days in which each pixel on the map was at least 10 percent covered by ice. Gray areas are labeled “no trend” because the change over time is not statistically significant (using a 90-percent confidence level). Data source: NOAA, 2019 The Great Lakes—Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario—form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth. These lakes support a variety of ecosystems and play a vital role in the economy of the eight neighboring states and the Canadian province of Ontario, providing drinking water, shipping lanes, fisheries, recreational opportunities, and more. Parts of the Great Lakes typically freeze every winter. As the Earth’s climate changes, though, rising air temperatures (see the indicator) and water temperatures (see the indicator) have led to less ice cover on many lakes in North America, including the Great Lakes. Ice cover is expected to decline further as the climate continues to warm. The area that freezes and the length of time that the lakes remain frozen can have a wide range of effects on people and ecosystems. As with other lakes (see the indicator), ice cover on the Great Lakes can affect aquatic ecosystems, as well as recreational opportunities such as ice fishing. Due to the size of the Great Lakes, ice cover also plays an important role in regional weather patterns and the shipping industry. While reduced ice cover could lengthen the shipping season, it also allows more water to evaporate from the lakes, which can lead to lower water levels (see the indicator) and restrict shipping channels. More evaporation can also lead to an increase in precipitation over nearby land, especially “lake effect” snow (see the indicator). This indicator presents two related ways of measuring ice cover in the Great Lakes: area (the percentage of the lake surface area that is frozen) and duration (the length of time the lakes stay frozen). Both parts of this indicator are based on daily and weekly charts and maps created by the Canadian Ice Service and the U.S. National Ice Center, which are derived from a long-running collection of observations from ships, shore, aircraft, and satellites. Complete data are available back to 1973 for each lake. Figure 1 shows the maximum portion of each lake’s surface area that was frozen in each year. Figure 2 tracks duration by showing the total number of days per year in which at least 5 percent of the lake surface was frozen. In each case, the period analyzed runs from December through May, with this entire “season” considered part of the same year. For example, “2020” represents conditions from December 2019 through May 2020. The map in Figure 3 shows how the length of time the Great Lakes stay frozen has changed over time, and how these changes vary by location. Data for this part of the indicator were available through 2019. Figure 3 only shows a rate of change for pixels where the trend is statistically significant. Temperature trends influence ice-covered area and duration, but natural year-to-year variations and decadal climate cycles may play a bigger role. With more than four decades of data, though, this indicator clearly shows meaningful long-term trends and variations that relate to the regional climate of the Great Lakes, which is linked to broader global weather and climate patterns. Ice cover area and duration data were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory at: .

This indicator measures the amount of time that ice is present on lakes in the United States. This figure shows the “ice-on” date, or date of first freeze, for nine U.S. lakes. The data are available from as early as 1850 to 2019, depending on the lake, and have been smoothed using a nine-year moving average. Data source: Various organizations This figure shows the “ice-off” date, or date of ice thawing and breakup, for 14 U.S. lakes. The data are available from as early as 1840 to 2019, depending on the lake, and have been smoothed using a nine-year moving average. Data source: Various organizations This figure shows the change in the “ice-off” date, or date of ice thawing and breakup, for 14 U.S. lakes during the period from 1905 to 2019. Twelve of the lakes have red circles with negative numbers, which represent earlier thaw dates. Larger circles indicate larger changes. Two of the lakes had no change in thaw dates. Data source: Various organizations The formation of ice cover on lakes in the winter and its disappearance the following spring depends on climate factors such as air temperature, cloud cover, and wind. Conditions such as heavy rains or snowmelt in locations upstream or elsewhere in the watershed also affect the length of time a lake is frozen. Thus, ice formation and breakup dates are key indicators of climate change. If lakes remain frozen for longer periods, it can signify that the climate is cooling. Conversely, shorter periods of ice cover suggest a warming climate. Changes in ice cover can affect the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of a body of water. For example, ice influences heat and moisture transfers between a lake and the atmosphere. Reduced lake ice cover leads to increased evaporation and lower water levels, as well as an increase in water temperature and sunlight penetration. These changes, in turn, can affect plant and animal life cycles and the availability of suitable habitat. Additionally, ice cover affects the amount of heat that is reflected from the Earth’s surface. Exposed water will absorb and retain heat, making the Earth’s surface warmer, whereas an ice- and snow-covered lake will reflect more of the sun’s energy and absorb less. (For more information on ice and snow reflecting sunlight, see the indicator.) The timing and duration of ice cover on lakes and other bodies of water can also affect society—particularly in relation to shipping and transportation, hydroelectric power generation, and fishing. The impacts can be positive or negative. For example, reduced ice cover on a large lake could extend the open-water shipping season but require vessels to reduce their cargo capacity, as increased evaporation leads to lower water levels. This indicator analyzes the dates at which lakes freeze and thaw. Freeze dates occur when a continuous and immobile ice cover forms over a body of water. Thaw dates occur when the ice cover breaks up and open water becomes extensive. Freeze and thaw dates have been recorded through human visual observations for more than 150 years. The National Snow and Ice Data Center maintains a database with freeze and thaw observations from more than 850 lakes and rivers throughout the Northern Hemisphere. This indicator focuses on 14 lakes within the United States that have the longest and most complete historical records. The lakes of interest are located in Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, and Maine. Although there is a lengthy historical record of freeze and thaw dates for a much larger set of lakes and rivers, some records are incomplete, with breaks ranging from brief lapses to large gaps in data. This indicator is limited to 14 lakes with sufficiently complete historical records. The four Maine lakes and Lake Osakis only have data for ice thaw, so they do not appear in Figure 1 (first freeze date). Data used in this indicator are all based on visual observations. While the procedures for making observations of lake ice are consistent over time, visual observations by individuals are open to some interpretation and can differ from one individual to the next. In addition, historical observations for lakes have typically been made from a particular spot on the shore, which might not be representative of lakes as a whole or comparable to satellite-based observations. Considerations for defining the thaw date are specific to each lake. Data through 2004 for most lakes were obtained from the Global Lake and River Ice Phenology Database, which is maintained by the National Snow and Ice Data Center. These data are available at: . More recent data were obtained from state, local, and other organizations that collected or compiled the observations."

This regional feature examines how the surface area of glaciers in Glacier National Park in Montana has changed since 1966. This figure shows the change in total glacier surface area (in square miles) for all 37 named glaciers in Glacier National Park for four discrete points in time from 1966 to 2015. Data source: Fagre et al., 2017; USGS, 2017 This map illustrates the change in surface area of all 37 named glaciers in Glacier National Park for 1966, 1998, 2005, and 2015. Use the red map icon above to open an interactive version where users can view the individual data layers, pan the map, and zoom to see more detail. Data source: Fagre et al., 2017; USGS, 2017 Visitors from far and wide are drawn to in Montana for its dramatic beauty and its glaciers. Established in 1910, Glacier is one of the most visited national parks in the United States. Warming temperatures and other changes are melting the park’s alpine glaciers. Such changes have implications not only for tourism, but also for the ecosystems, animals, and people that depend on glacier-fed streamflow. Shrinking glaciers represent a clear and compelling indicator of climate change. In 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) published a study where they analyzed aerial images from 1966, 1998, 2005, and 2015 to assess changes over time in the surface area of Glacier National Park’s 37 named glaciers. Scientists are studying the Park’s alpine glaciers to better understand how they have changed, what that means for the local environment, and how they may inform land management decisions in the park. Surface area changes of these glaciers do not reflect how the total mass or volume of ice may have changed. Changes in glacier surface area will not necessarily track linearly with changes in temperature because of differences in geology, shade, wind patterns that deposit snow, and other factors. The 37 glaciers included in this data set include all of Glacier National Park’s large named glaciers, but they do not represent a comprehensive accounting of all glaciers or permanent ice features in the park. These glaciers are also not necessarily representative of glaciers in other regions. In the past few decades, though, several national parks have begun to track glacier mass balance. All of these programs depend on data sets, expertise, and methodologies developed by the intensive research associated with USGS’s long-term glacier monitoring program. The data in this feature come from surface area measurements of the 37 named glaciers in Glacier National Park that have been tracked over time. This data set was originally published by USGS’s Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center. This data set is also publicly available on the USGS website at: ."

This indicator shows the cumulative change in the mass balance of Arctic glaciers. This figure shows the cumulative change in mass balance of a set of eight glaciers located at a latitude of 66°N or higher with data beginning in 1945. Each time series has been adjusted to make 1970 a common zero point because this was the first year for which mass balance data are available for all eight glaciers. Negative values indicate a net loss of ice and snow compared with the base year of 1970. For consistency, measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which reflects the mass loss of the glacier by representing changes in the glacier’s average thickness. Data sources: WGMS, 2021 Rapid changes are occurring across the Arctic, where air temperatures are warming twice as fast as the global average temperature. The loss of land-based ice in the Arctic has accelerated in recent decades, and since at least 1972, the Arctic has been the dominant source of global sea-level rise. Greenland is the largest contributor to global sea-level rise from Arctic land ice, followed by small glaciers. If increases in greenhouse gas concentrations continue at current rates, it is expected that many of the smallest glaciers across the Arctic would disappear entirely by mid-century. As the explains, glaciers are important as an indicator of climate change and provide visible evidence of changes in temperature and precipitation. Retreating glaciers and thawing permafrost in the Arctic are creating local and regional hazards that disrupt lives and livelihoods, infrastructure, sustainable development, and national security. The indicator focuses on a set of eight routinely-measured glaciers at a latitude of 66°N or higher with data back to at least 1970—in one case, 1945. Figure 1 shows the cumulative mass balance of these glaciers from 1945 to 2020. This measurement of mass balance is consistent with EPA’s , just focusing in this case on eight routinely measured glaciers north of the Arctic Circle. “Mass balance” refers to the net gain or loss of snow and ice (accumulation versus melting, sublimation, and calving). The measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which reflects the mass loss of the glacier by representing changes in the glacier’s average thickness. Cumulative change is determined from the base year of 1970, the first year in which all eight glaciers had annual mass balance data. The relationship between climate change and glacier mass balance is complex, and the observed changes at specific reference glaciers reflect a combination of global and local variations in temperature and precipitation. Individual glaciers also vary in their structure, flow, and response to climate. Slightly different measurement and analysis methods have been used at different glaciers, but overall trends are similar. Long-term measurements are available for only a very small percentage of the world’s glaciers. This indicator does not include the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, although two decades of satellite data suggest that these ice sheets are also experiencing a net loss of ice (see the ). Continued satellite data collection will allow scientists to evaluate long-term trends in the future. The World Glacier Monitoring Service compiled data for Figure 1, based on measurements collected by a variety of organizations around the world. Historical data, as well as periodic reports and measurements of the reference glaciers, are available at: . This indicator can also be found at: ."

This indicator examines the balance between snow accumulation and melting in glaciers, and it describes how glaciers in the United States and around the world have changed over time. This figure shows the cumulative change in mass balance of a set of “reference” glaciers worldwide beginning in 1956. The line on the upper graph represents the average of all the glaciers that were measured. Negative values indicate a net loss of ice and snow compared with the base year of 1956. For consistency, measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which represent changes in the average thickness of a glacier. The small chart below shows how many glaciers were measured in each year. Some glacier measurements have not yet been finalized for the last few years, hence the smaller number of sites. Data source: WGMS, 2024 This figure shows the cumulative mass balance of four U.S. reference glaciers since measurements began in the 1950s or 1960s. For each glacier, the mass balance is set at zero for the base year of 1965. Negative values indicate a net loss of ice and snow compared with the base year. For consistency, measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which represent changes in the average thickness of a glacier. Data source: USGS, 2024 Sources: Post, 1958; Nolan, 2003 A glacier is a large mass of snow and ice that has accumulated over many years and is present year-round. In the United States, glaciers can be found in the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, the Cascades, and throughout Alaska. A glacier flows naturally like a river, only much more slowly. At higher elevations, glaciers accumulate snow, which eventually becomes compressed into ice. At lower elevations, the “river” of ice naturally loses mass because of melting and ice breaking off and floating away (iceberg calving) if the glacier ends in a lake or the ocean. When melting and calving are exactly balanced by new snow accumulation, a glacier is in equilibrium and its mass will neither increase nor decrease. In many areas, glaciers provide communities and ecosystems with a reliable source of streamflow and drinking water, particularly in times of extended drought and late in the summer, when seasonal snowpack has melted away. Freshwater runoff from glaciers also influences ocean ecosystems. Glaciers are important as an indicator of climate change because physical changes in glaciers—whether they are growing or shrinking, advancing or receding—provide visible evidence of changes in temperature and precipitation. If glaciers lose more ice than they can accumulate through new snowfall, they ultimately add more water to the oceans, leading to a rise in sea level (see the indicator). The same kinds of changes occur on a much larger scale within the giant ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica, potentially leading to even bigger implications for sea level. Small glaciers tend to respond more quickly to climate change than the giant ice sheets. Altogether, the world’s small glaciers are adding roughly the same amount of water to the oceans per year as the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica combined. Between 1971 and 2018, they added more water overall to the oceans than the ice sheets did. This indicator is based on long-term monitoring data collected at selected glaciers around the world. Scientists collect detailed measurements to determine glacier mass balance, which is the net gain or loss of snow and ice over the course of the year. A negative mass balance indicates that a glacier has lost ice or snow. If cumulative mass balance becomes more negative over time, it means glaciers are losing mass more quickly than they can accumulate new snow. Figure 1 shows trends in mass balance for a set of 61 reference glaciers around the world that have been measured consistently since the 1970s, including several that have been measured since the 1950s. Data from these reference glaciers have been averaged together to depict changes over time. Figure 2 shows trends for four of these reference glaciers that are located in the United States. South Cascade Glacier in Washington state, Lemon Creek Glacier in southeastern Alaska, Wolverine Glacier near Alaska’s southern coast, and Gulkana Glacier in Alaska’s interior are all part of the U.S. Geological Survey’s longstanding “benchmark” glacier program. These four glaciers were chosen because they have been studied extensively for many years and because they are thought to be representative of other glaciers nearby. This indicator describes the change in glacier mass balance, which is measured as the average change in thickness across the surface of a glacier. The change in ice or snow has been converted to the equivalent amount of liquid water. The relationship between climate change and glacier mass balance is complex, and the observed changes at specific reference or benchmark glaciers might reflect a combination of global and local variations in temperature and precipitation. Individual glaciers also vary in their structure, flow, and response to climate. Slightly different measurement and analysis methods have been used at different glaciers, but overall trends appear to be similar. Long-term measurements are available for only a relatively small percentage of the world’s glaciers. This indicator does not include the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, although EPA’s indicator shows that they are also experiencing a net loss of ice. The World Glacier Monitoring Service compiled data for Figure 1, based on measurements collected by a variety of organizations around the world.

This indicator examines the balance between snow accumulation and melting in the ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica. This figure shows the cumulative change in mass in the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica since 1992. The dark “combined” lines are based on more than 20 different studies that have been combined for each region. Shading shows the uncertainty estimates from the various data sets that feed into the combined average. The two “NASA JPL” lines have been added to show results from one commonly cited analysis, including seasonal variations. All estimates are centered at zero in 2002 to provide a consistent point of reference. Thus, a downward slope indicates a net loss of ice and snow. For reference, 1,000 billion metric tons is equal to about 260 cubic miles of ice—enough to raise sea level by about 3 millimeters. Data sources: Otosaka et al., 2023; NASA, 2024 Ice sheets are large bodies of ice on land that cover hundreds of thousands of square miles on Greenland and Antarctica. Greenland’s ice sheet reaches more than 1 mile thick on average in the interior and contains an estimated 700,000 cubic miles of ice, while Antarctica’s ice is nearly 3 miles thick in some places, with a volume of about 7 million cubic miles. Together, these ice sheets hold nearly 70 percent of the world’s fresh water. Some of this ice has been in place for more than 1 million years. Ice sheets accumulate snowfall—just like small glaciers (see the indicator) but at a larger scale. Over time, this snow becomes compacted into layers of ice, and the weight of this ice causes it to flow downhill and outward toward the ocean. When an ice sheet is in equilibrium, new snow accumulation is balanced by melting at the surface, runoff, and calving (ice breaking off to form icebergs) at the ocean. A warmer climate affects ice sheets in several ways. The most evident impact observed to date is a loss of ice due to warmer air and ocean waters. Warmer air causes the ice to melt more quickly and flow more rapidly to the sea, especially in low-elevation regions near the edges of the ice sheets. Warmer ocean waters melt the edge and base of the ice sheet and accelerate the process of calving. In addition, warmer ocean waters weaken the floating ice shelves that form in key places along the coast, especially in Antarctica. These ice shelves help to hold back the flow of ice on land, so as ice shelves shrink or disappear, ice from the ice sheet can flow into the ocean more quickly. Some of the losses are offset, because warmer air allows very cold interior regions in Greenland and Antarctica to receive more snowfall. Overall, though, both ice sheets are experiencing a net loss of ice. Ultimately, as the ice sheets shrink, the water they add to the ocean raises sea level around the world (see the indicator). Melting of Greenland and Antarctica’s ice sheets accounted for about one-third of observed global sea level rise between 2006 and 2015. Thus, ice sheets are important indicators not only because of their sensitivity to changes in climate, but also for their role in global sea level rise. Because Greenland and Antarctica are so large and remote, satellite instruments offer the most effective way to measure changes in their ice sheets. Scientists have used three main measurement techniques to do this: Estimates of the exact rate of ice gain or loss in Greenland and Antarctica vary depending on the measurement technique and the methods used to process the data. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, to get a more complete picture, scientists have combined many different estimates from a variety of organizations. This indicator offers a combined estimate from an international program called the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE). IMBIE is supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA). The IMBIE team combined 27 peer-reviewed estimates of ice sheet mass balance for Greenland and 23 for Antarctica, going back as far as 1992 and representing all three major techniques. Figure 1 represents the results from their combined averages. Figure 1 also shows estimates from a specific analysis of GRACE data by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). These data are shown for reference and comparison because NASA JPL is a widely cited, influential source, and because the results show seasonal patterns. The relationship between climate change and ice sheet mass balance is complex, particularly in Antarctica, where large areas will continue to be too cold to experience appreciable surface melting, some areas may experience more snowfall that offsets the other effects of warming, and rates of ice loss can be heavily influenced by specific “tipping point” events such as the collapse of an ice shelf. Scientists who study Antarctica’s ice sheets often divide the continent into three main regions—East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula—because each of these regions has distinct geological characteristics and weather patterns that influence their vulnerability to climate change. Data are not available prior to 1992 for these two featured data sets. However, studies using other methods provide a longer historical perspective. Unlike smaller land ice features such as glaciers (see the indicator), the vast ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica do not have enough widespread, repeated measurements collected onsite to permit reliable estimates of changes in overall mass balance. This indicator presents results from multiple measurement methodologies for comparison and to expand the temporal coverage of the time series for ice sheet mass balance of Greenland and Antarctica. The NASA time series each have a gap from mid-2017 to mid-2018, reflecting the gap between the original GRACE satellite mission and the GRACE Follow On satellites that launched in 2018. The IMBIE team and NASA JPL processed the data for Figure 1. The IMBIE data have been published at: , along with documentation. The JPL data have been published on NASA’s “Vital Signs” website at: , along with documentation."

This indicator tracks the extent of sea ice around Antarctica. This figure shows Antarctic sea ice extent for the months of February and September of each year from 1979 through 2021. The minimum and maximum sea ice extent typically occur in February and September each year. Data source: NSIDC, 2022 These maps from 2021 provide an example of how Antarctic sea ice coverage typically varies between the annual minimum and maximum. Source: NASA, 2022 The Southern Ocean around Antarctica freezes to form sea ice every year. This sea ice typically reaches its maximum extent in September or early October, around the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. At that point, virtually the entire continent of Antarctica is surrounded by a ring of sea ice (see images below). The ice melts in the summer months (December to February) because of warmer temperatures and long hours of sunlight. Unlike the Arctic, where a large area of sea ice lasts year-round (see the indicator), the sea ice around Antarctica is thinner and nearly all of it melts in a typical summer. This happens because no landmass is present to stop Antarctic sea ice from breaking up and drifting northward into warmer waters, where it eventually melts. Like Arctic sea ice, Antarctic sea ice affects global climate, regional climate, and ecosystems. Because ice is more reflective than liquid water, it plays a significant role in maintaining the Earth’s energy balance and helping to keep polar regions cool. (For more information on how the color of the Earth's surface affects the absorption of sunlight, see the indicator.) Sea ice also keeps the air cool by forming a barrier between the cold air above and the warmer water below. Antarctic sea ice is an important part of the habitat for penguins, seals, and other animals. Warmer air and ocean temperatures are generally expected to reduce the amount of sea ice present worldwide. While warming has already driven a noticeable decline in sea ice in the Arctic, extent in the Antarctic as a whole has not yet declined, which may reflect influences of wind patterns, ocean currents, and precipitation around the continent. Figure 1 shows Antarctic sea ice extent from 1979, when routine monitoring by satellites started, to 2021. Sea ice extent is defined as the area of ocean where at least 15 percent of the surface is frozen. This threshold was chosen because scientists have found that it gives the best approximation of the edge of the ice. Data are collected throughout the year, but for comparison, this indicator focuses on the months when sea ice typically reaches its minimum and maximum extent. February is typically when the sea ice extent reaches its annual minimum after melting during the spring and summer. The ice typically reaches its maximum extent in late September or early October after winter freezing, with the largest monthly average extent occurring in September. However, in 2021, maximum extent occurred in August. Data for this indicator were gathered by the National Snow and Ice Data Center using satellite imaging technology and data processing methods developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Unlike EPA’s Arctic Sea Ice indicator, this indicator does not show the age of Antarctic sea ice. This is because nearly all of the Antarctic ice melts every summer, unlike the Arctic, where a large portion of ice survives for multiple years. Compared with the noticeable decrease in Arctic sea ice extent (see the indicator), the increase in Antarctic sea ice is small. Many factors appear to be influencing Antarctic sea ice extent, including changes in wind patterns and fresh water entering the ocean from melting ice sheets. For instance, a 2016 study showed that changes to atmospheric circulation patterns in the Antarctic region are responsible for recent increases in sea ice extent. Without better ice thickness and ice volume estimates, it is difficult to characterize how the total amount of Antarctic sea ice is responding to climate change.

This indicator tracks the extent, age, and melt season of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. This figure shows Arctic sea ice extent for the months of September and March of each year from 1979 through 2023. September and March are when the minimum and maximum extent typically occur each year. Data source: NSIDC, 2023 November 2023 This figure shows the distribution of Arctic sea ice extent by age group during the week in September with the smallest extent of ice for each year. The total extent in Figure 2 differs from the extent in Figure 1 because Figure 1 shows a monthly average, while Figure 2 shows conditions during a single week. Data source: NSIDC, 2023 This figure shows the timing of each year’s Arctic sea ice melt season. The shaded band spans from the date when ice begins to melt consistently until the date when it begins to refreeze. Data source: NASA, 2023 November Source: NASA, 2023 Sea ice, which is sea water that freezes from the ocean surface down to several feet below, is an integral part of the Arctic Ocean. During the dark winter months, sea ice essentially covers the entire Arctic Ocean. In summer, some of this ice melts because of warmer temperatures and long hours of sunlight. Sea ice typically reaches its minimum thickness and extent in mid-September, when the area covered by ice is roughly half the size of the winter maximum. The ice then begins to expand again during fall and winter when temperatures decrease and sunlight is limited. The extent of area covered by Arctic sea ice is an important indicator of changes in global climate because warmer air and water temperatures are reducing the amount of sea ice present. Because sea ice is light-colored, it reflects more sunlight (solar energy) back to space than liquid water, thereby playing an important role in maintaining the Earth’s energy balance and helping to keep polar regions cool. (For more information on the effects of surface color on reflecting sunlight, see the indicator.) Sea ice also keeps the air cool by forming a barrier between the cold air above and the relatively warmer water below. As the amount of sea ice decreases due to the oceans absorbing more solar energy, the cooling effect of this ice is reduced, which can magnify the original warming. The magnified warming then leads to even more loss of sea ice. The age of sea ice is also an important indicator of Arctic conditions, because ice that has accumulated over many years is generally thicker and stronger than younger ice. A loss of older ice suggests that the Arctic ice cover is becoming thinner. Evidence also suggests that the melt season has become longer; the ice is starting to melt earlier in the year and freeze later than it used to. Changes in sea ice can directly affect the health of Arctic ecosystems. Mammals such as polar bears and walruses rely on the presence of sea ice for hunting, breeding, and migrating. These animals face the threat of declining birth rates and restricted access to food sources because of reduced sea ice coverage and thickness. Impacts on Arctic wildlife, as well as the loss of ice itself, are already restricting the traditional subsistence hunting lifestyle of indigenous Arctic populations such as the Yup’ik, Iñupiat, and Inuit. While diminished sea ice can have negative ecological effects, it can also present commercial and economic opportunities. For instance, reduced sea ice opens shipping lanes and increases access to natural resources in the Arctic region. Figure 1 shows Arctic sea ice extent from 1979, when routine monitoring by satellites started, to 2023. Sea ice extent is defined as the area of ocean where at least 15 percent of the surface is frozen. This threshold was chosen because scientists have found that it gives the best approximation of the edge of the ice. While data are collected throughout the year, this indicator focuses on the months when sea ice typically reaches its minimum and maximum extent. September is typically when the sea ice extent reaches its annual minimum after melting during the spring and summer. Conversely, March is typically when sea ice reaches its maximum extent after winter freezing. Data for this indicator were gathered by the National Snow and Ice Data Center using satellite imaging technology and data processing methods developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Figure 2 examines the age of the ice that is present in the Arctic during the one week in September that has the smallest extent of ice. By combining daily satellite images, wind measurements, and data from surface buoys that move with the ice, scientists can track specific parcels of ice as they move over time. This tracking enables them to calculate the age of the ice in different parts of the Arctic. Although satellites started collecting data in 1979, Figure 2 only shows data back to 1984 because it is not possible to know the full age distribution until the ice has been tracked for at least five years. Figure 3 shows the start and end dates of each year’s Arctic sea ice melt season, starting in 1979. It is based on the same satellite instruments as Figure 1. Increasing air and ocean temperatures associated with climate change are not the only factors contributing to reductions in sea ice. Other conditions that may be affected by climate change, such as fluctuations in oceanic and atmospheric circulation and natural annual and decadal variability, also affect the extent of sea ice. Determining the age of ice is an imperfect science, as there are cases where a small amount of older ice might exist within an area classified as younger, or vice versa. The data for Figures 1 and 2 were provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, which produces a variety of reports and a seasonal newsletter analyzing Arctic sea ice data. Data for Figure 1 are available online at: , while Figure 2 is based on an analysis by the University of Colorado that is typically updated each year at: .

The Earth’s surface contains many forms of snow and ice, including sea, lake, and river ice; snow cover; glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets; and frozen ground. Climate change can dramatically alter the Earth’s snow- and ice-covered areas because snow and ice can easily change between solid and liquid states in response to relatively minor changes in temperature. This chapter focuses on trends in snow, glaciers, and the freezing and thawing of oceans and lakes. Reduced snowfall and less snow cover on the ground could diminish the beneficial insulating effects of snow for vegetation and wildlife, while also affecting water supplies, transportation, cultural practices, travel, and recreation for millions of people. For communities in Arctic regions, reduced sea ice could increase coastal erosion and exposure to storms, threatening homes and property, while thawing ground could damage roads and buildings and accelerate erosion. Conversely, reduced snow and ice could present commercial opportunities for others, including ice-free shipping lanes and increased access to natural resources. Such changing climate conditions can have worldwide implications because snow and ice influence air temperatures, sea level, ocean currents, and storm patterns. For example, melting ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica add fresh water to the ocean, increasing sea level and possibly changing ocean circulation that is driven by differences in temperature and salinity. Because of their light color, snow and ice also reflect more sunlight than open water or bare ground, so a reduction in snow cover and ice causes the Earth’s surface to absorb more energy from the sun and become warmer."

This indicator describes changes in the chemistry of the ocean that relate to the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the water. This figure shows the relationship between changes in ocean carbon dioxide levels (measured in the left column as a partial pressure—a common way of measuring the amount of a gas) and acidity (measured as pH in the right column). The data come from two observation stations in the North Atlantic Ocean (Bermuda and Canary Islands), one in the Caribbean Sea (Cariaco), and one in the Pacific (Hawaii). The up-and-down pattern shows the influence of seasonal variations. Data sources: Bates, 2016; González-Dávila, 2012; University of South Florida, 2021; University of Hawaii, 2023 This map shows changes in the aragonite saturation level of ocean surface waters between the 1880s and the most recent decade (2006–2015). Aragonite is a form of calcium carbonate that many marine animals use to build their skeletons and shells. The lower the saturation level, the more difficult it is for organisms to build and maintain their skeletons and shells. A negative change represents a decrease in saturation. Data source: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, 2016 Acidity is commonly measured using the pH scale. Pure water has a pH of about 7, which is considered neutral. A substance with a pH less than 7 is considered to be acidic, while a substance with a pH greater than 7 is considered to be basic or alkaline. The lower the pH, the more acidic the substance. Like the well-known Richter scale for measuring earthquakes, the pH scale is based on powers of 10, which means a substance with a pH of 3 is 10 times more acidic than a substance with a pH of 4. For more information about pH, visit: . Image recreated from: Environment Canada, 2008, with additional data from IPCC, 2014 The ocean plays an important role in regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide rise (see the indicator), the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide. Because of the slow mixing time between surface waters and deeper waters, it can take hundreds to thousands of years to establish this balance. From 1750 to 2019, oceans absorbed about 25 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere by human activities, according to data in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (total human emissions of 685 ± 75 PgC and ocean uptake of 170 ± 20 PgC). Although the ocean’s ability to take up carbon dioxide prevents atmospheric levels from climbing even higher, rising levels of carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean can have a negative effect on some marine life. Carbon dioxide reacts with sea water to produce carbonic acid. The resulting increase in acidity (measured by lower pH values) changes the balance of minerals in the water. This makes it more difficult for corals, some types of plankton, and other creatures to produce a mineral called calcium carbonate, which is the main ingredient in their hard skeletons or shells. Thus, declining pH can make it more difficult for these animals to thrive. This can lead to broader changes in the overall structure of ocean and coastal ecosystems, and can ultimately affect fish and shellfish populations and the people, communities, or Tribes who depend on them for jobs or subsistence. While changes in ocean pH and mineral saturation caused by the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide generally occur over many decades, these properties can fluctuate over shorter periods, especially in coastal and surface waters. For example, increased photosynthesis during the day and during the summer leads to natural fluctuations in pH. Acidity also varies with water temperature. This indicator describes trends in pH and related properties of ocean water, based on a combination of direct observations, calculations, and modeling. Figure 1 shows pH values and levels of dissolved carbon dioxide at four locations that have collected measurements consistently over the last few decades. These data have been either measured directly or calculated from related measurements, such as dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity. Data come from two stations in the Atlantic Ocean (Bermuda and the Canary Islands), one in the Caribbean Sea (Cariaco Basin), and one in the Pacific (Hawaii). The global map in Figure 2 shows changes over time in aragonite saturation level. Aragonite is a specific form of calcium carbonate that many organisms produce and use to build their skeletons and shells, and the saturation state is a measure of how easily aragonite can dissolve in the water. The lower the saturation level, the more difficult it is for organisms to build and maintain their protective skeletons and shells. This map was created by comparing average conditions during the 1880s with average conditions during the most recent 10 years of available data (2006–2015). Aragonite saturation has only been measured at selected locations during the last few decades, but it can be calculated reliably for different times and locations based on the relationships scientists have observed among aragonite saturation, pH, dissolved carbon, water temperature, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and other factors that can be measured. Thus, while Figure 2 was created using a computer model, it is based on measurements. This indicator focuses on surface waters, which can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere within a few months. It can take much longer for changes in pH and mineral saturation to spread to deeper waters, so the full effect of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on ocean acidity may not be seen for many decades, if not centuries. Studies suggest that the impacts of ocean acidification may be greater at depth, because the aragonite saturation level is naturally lower in deeper waters. Ocean chemistry is not uniform around the world, so local conditions can cause pH or aragonite saturation measurements to differ from the global average. For example, carbon dioxide dissolves more readily in cold water than in warm water, so colder regions could experience greater impacts from acidity than warmer regions. Air and water pollution also lead to increased acidity in some areas. Data for Figure 1 came from four studies: the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study, the European Station for Time-Series in the Ocean (Canary Islands), the Carbon Retention in a Colored Ocean (CARIACO) program (Cariaco Basin), and the Hawaii Ocean Time-Series.

This indicator describes how sea level has changed over time. The indicator describes two types of sea level changes: absolute and relative. This graph shows cumulative changes in sea level for the world’s oceans since 1880, based on a combination of long-term tide gauge measurements and recent satellite measurements. This figure shows average absolute sea level change, which refers to the height of the ocean surface, regardless of whether nearby land is rising or falling. Satellite data are based solely on measured sea level, while the long-term tide gauge data include a small correction factor because the size and shape of the oceans are changing slowly over time. (On average, the ocean floor has been gradually sinking since the last Ice Age peak, 20,000 years ago.) The shaded band shows the likely range of values, based on the number of measurements collected and the precision of the methods used. Data sources: CSIRO, 2017; NOAA, 2024 This map shows cumulative changes in relative sea level from 1960 to 2023 at tide gauge stations along U.S. coasts. Relative sea level reflects changes in sea level as well as land elevation. Data source: NOAA, 2024 As the temperature of the Earth changes, so does sea level. Temperature and sea level are linked for two main reasons: Changing sea levels can affect human activities in coastal areas. Rising sea level inundates low-lying wetlands and dry land, erodes shorelines, contributes to coastal flooding, and increases the flow of salt water into estuaries and nearby groundwater aquifers. Higher sea level also makes coastal infrastructure more vulnerable to damage from storms. The sea level changes that affect coastal systems involve more than just expanding oceans, however, because the Earth’s continents can also rise and fall relative to the oceans. Land can rise through processes such as sediment accumulation (the process that built the Mississippi River delta) and geological uplift (for example, as glaciers melt and the land below is no longer weighed down by heavy ice). In other areas, land can sink because of erosion, sediment compaction, natural subsidence (sinking due to geologic changes), groundwater withdrawal, or engineering projects that prevent rivers from naturally depositing sediments along their banks. Changes in ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream can also affect sea levels by pushing more water against some coastlines and pulling it away from others, raising or lowering sea levels accordingly. Scientists account for these types of changes by measuring sea level change in two different ways. sea level change refers to how the height of the ocean rises or falls relative to the land at a particular location. In contrast, sea level change refers to the height of the ocean surface above the center of the earth, without regard to whether nearby land is rising or falling. Evidence suggests sea level along the U.S. coastline will rise 10 to 12 inches by 2050—as much as the rise measured from 1920 to 2020. (The 10 to 12 inches are an average: differences in both land and ocean height mean the rise will vary regionally along U.S. coasts.) This indicator presents trends in sea level based on measurements from tide gauges and from satellites that orbit the Earth. Tide gauges measure relative sea level change at points along the coast, while satellite instruments measure absolute sea level change over nearly the entire ocean surface. Many tide gauges have collected data for more than 100 years, while satellites have collected data since the early 1990s. Figure 1 shows annual absolute sea level change averaged over the entire Earth’s ocean surface. The long-term trend is based on tide gauge data that have been adjusted to show absolute global trends through calibration with recent satellite data. This long-term data set has been calculated through 2013, while satellite data are now available through the end of 2023. Figure 2 shows trends at a more local scale, highlighting the 1960 to 2023 change in relative sea level at 72 tide gauges along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts of the United States. Relative sea level trends represent a combination of absolute sea level change and any local land movement. Tide gauge measurements such as those in Figure 2 generally cannot distinguish between these two different influences without an accurate measurement of vertical land motion nearby. Some changes in relative and absolute sea level can be due to multi-year cycles such as El Niño and La Niña, which affect coastal ocean temperatures, salt content, wind patterns, atmospheric pressure (and thus storm tracks), and currents. Obtaining a reliable trend can require many years of data, which is why the satellite record in Figure 1 has been supplemented with a longer-term reconstruction based on tide gauge measurements. Absolute sea level trends were provided by Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These data are based on measurements collected by satellites and tide gauges. Relative sea level data are available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which publishes an interactive online map ( ) with links to detailed data for each tide gauge."

This feature provides a closer look at one consequence of sea level rise along the Atlantic coast: the conversion of land to open water. This graph shows the net amount of land converted to open water along the Atlantic coast during three time periods: 1996–2001, 1996–2006, and 1996–2011. The results are divided into two regions: the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic (see locator map). Negative numbers show where land loss is outpaced by the accumulation of new land. Data source: NOAA, 2013 This graph shows the net amount of land converted to open water along the Atlantic coast during three time periods: 1996–2001, 1996–2006, and 1996–2011. The results are divided into categories to show the type of land that has been converted to open water. Data source: NOAA, 2013 Much of the land along the Atlantic coast is flat and close to sea level—including thousands of square miles of marshes and other productive wetlands, plus many low-lying cities. In addition, much of the land along the Atlantic coast is sinking, which magnifies the local effect of sea level rise. The land in North America is actually still adjusting to the loss of ice after the last ice age, which peaked about 20,000 years ago. Back then, thick sheets of ice covered areas of what is now Canada and the northern United States. The weight of all that ice depressed the land beneath it, but caused the land farther south (particularly the Mid-Atlantic region from North Carolina to New York) to bulge upward. After the ice melted and the extra weight was lifted, northern areas began to rise, and the Mid-Atlantic region started to sink. This very slow process continues today. Rising sea level tends to make headlines during extreme events, like the storm surge that caused billions of dollars in damage during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Yet rising sea level can also cause permanent changes in the landscape when it inundates (submerges) low-lying land. The Atlantic coast is particularly vulnerable because of low elevations and sinking shorelines. The loss of coastal land can affect a large number of people, as nearly 10 million Americans live in a coastal floodplain. Coastal ecosystems are also at risk. These environments provide habitat for many kinds of plants and animals, as well as services that ensure people’s well-being, ranging from food production to recreation. Coastal wetlands provide valuable nursery, feeding, breeding, staging, and resting areas for many fish, shellfish, mammals, and birds, and they can buffer coastal areas against storm and wave damage. As sea level rises, dry land can turn into wetland or open water. Existing wetlands can be threatened, too, as salt marshes, mangrove forests, and other coastal wetlands are at risk of being converted to open water. The indicator shows that sea level is rising overall in connection with climate change, but the rate of change varies by region, as do the effects. To provide a useful regional perspective, this feature examines the amount of land lost to sea level rise along the Atlantic coast from Florida to New York. It is based on satellite data that have been collected and analyzed at five-year intervals since 1996. Figure 1 divides the Atlantic coast into two regions for comparison, while Figure 2 shows the different types of land that have been lost. Measurements of the change in coastal land depend on land cover and elevation data, which have significant limits in terms of accuracy and precision. Some results are field-checked for accuracy. The coastal land cover data are routinely compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coastal Change Analysis Program, and they represent the federal government’s most comprehensive set of data on land use and land cover in the coastal zone. Sea level rise is not the only factor that contributes to the loss of coastal land. In addition to the natural sinking of the shoreline in some areas, such as the Mid-Atlantic, coastal land loss has been made worse by human activities such as navigation and flood control structures that block wetland migration or the movement of sediment; withdrawal of ground water, oil, or natural gas in some regions; and boat traffic that accelerates wetland erosion. Natural processes unrelated to current sea level rise can also cause shores to erode. This feature is based on land cover data from the Coastal Change Analysis Program, which is coordinated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

This indicator tracks the occurrence of unusually high temperatures in U.S. coastal waters. This map shows the change in annual cumulative intensity of marine heat waves along U.S. coasts from 1982 to 2023. Cumulative intensity is measured in degree days—marine heat wave intensity multiplied by duration. Areas with increases are shown in red, with darker colors indicating greater change. The map shows total change, which is the annual rate of change (trend slope) multiplied by the number of years analyzed. The boundaries include the area within the U.S. exclusive economic zone. Data source: NOAA, 2024 This set of maps shows the change in cumulative intensity of marine heat waves along U.S. coasts from 1982 to 2023 by season. The calculation approach and geographic area are the same as in Figure 1. Seasons are defined as follows: December, January, and February for winter; March, April, and May for spring; June, July, and August for summer; and September, October, and November for fall. Data source: NOAA, 2024 These graphs show the percentage of each coastal region’s area that experienced at least one marine heat wave in a given year. The stacked segments show severity levels (see definitions in the technical documentation) for the most severe heat wave at a location, while the total height of the stack represents the total area that experienced a marine heat wave of any severity. For example, in 2023, 100 percent of the Northeast region experienced at least one heat wave of moderate severity or higher, while 35 percent of the region’s area experienced at least one severe heat wave and 8 percent experienced an extreme heat wave. Data are broken into six regions whose boundaries include the area within the U.S. exclusive economic zone. Data source: NOAA, 2024 These graphs show a timeline of marine heat wave events for five marine protected areas selected from different parts of the U.S. coastline. The columns in each graph show each individual event’s duration (width of the column), intensity (height), and severity level (color; see definitions in the technical documentation). The distribution of vertical columns reflects the frequency of heat waves. The small map to the right shows the areas analyzed (blue). Data source: NOAA, 2024 Temperature is an important physical characteristic of ocean water. As the indicator explains, the range of temperature conditions plays an important role in determining what species of plants, animals, and microbes can survive or thrive in a particular area. Long-term changes in these temperature ranges can affect ecological communities by shifting species’ geographic distribution (see the indicator), influencing migration and breeding patterns, and ultimately altering habitat and the movement of nutrients. Short-term spikes in temperature also pose a concern. Just like heat waves based on air temperature (see the indicator), marine heat waves are an extreme condition that can severely disrupt marine life. This disruption can cause harm as ocean creatures—particularly those that are stationary, like corals—are not able to escape waters that become too warm to tolerate for an extended period. Marine heat waves are associated with some of the largest disruptions to marine life in recent years. For example, persistent marine heat wave conditions in the northern Pacific have fed harmful algal blooms that then led to closures in the Dungeness crab fishery and deaths of sea lions. Daily, weekly, and seasonal variation in sea surface temperature is natural. Ocean temperatures can also vary year to year, due to multi-year cycles such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. As ocean waters become warmer overall, though, marine heat waves will become more common and more extreme. This indicator reports on observed trends in the occurrence and intensity of marine heat waves along U.S. coasts over the past four decades, based on daily sea surface temperature measurements. Sea surface temperature records come from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and are based on satellite measurements of water temperature, with additional data from buoys and ships providing confirmation and helping to fill occasional gaps in measurement coverage. The indicator starts in 1982, which was the first full year with available satellite data. For this indicator, a marine heat wave is a period of at least five days in a row in which the sea surface temperature at a given location is hotter than at least 90 percent of past observations at that location on that particular day of the year. For example, this means the temperature on August 15 at a particular location is compared with August 15 temperatures from many prior years at that location. Thus, a marine heat wave can occur at any time of year—even in winter—if the temperature is much warmer than usual. The indicator uses a 30-year historical reference period of 1982–2011 to establish these thresholds. Each marine heat wave event can be characterized by its duration (length in days) and its intensity (the number of degrees by which the temperature exceeded the 90 percent threshold). Figure 1 combines the duration, intensity, and frequency of marine heat waves into a single metric called cumulative intensity, measured in degree-days. For example, an event lasting 10 days with an intensity of 5 degrees in each day would have a cumulative intensity of 50 degree-days. This indicator adds degree-days for all events to get an annual total. If a location experiences an increase in annual cumulative intensity over time, that means marine heat waves are becoming either more common, longer, more intense, or some combination of the three. Figure 1 shows the long-term change in annual cumulative intensity at locations within the U.S. exclusive economic zone, which generally extends up to 200 nautical miles from the coast. Figure 2 follows the same approach but presents trends by season, as certain seasons are important times of year for food source availability and life cycle events like spawning and migration. Figure 3 provides a more detailed look at marine heat waves by coastal region, showing the portion of each region’s area affected by marine heat waves in each year, and the strength of each year’s most severe marine heat wave. Figure 4 provides a detailed timeline of marine heat wave events showing the duration, intensity, and level of severity of each event, focusing on five specific locations as case studies. The five locations are designated marine protected areas, which are areas with particular importance for protecting marine species populations. Examples have been selected from each of the different coastal regions. Sea surface temperature varies seasonally, but a marine heat wave can happen at any time of year if the water temperature is much higher than normal. Temperatures can also vary as a result of year-to-year climate patterns, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. The five areas selected for Figure 4 are not meant to be representative of conditions along the entire coastline, but they can be thought of as case studies that more closely illustrate location-specific marine heat wave conditions in ecologically sensitive and protected areas. This indicator is based on daily sea surface temperature data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information. These data are available online at: ."

The shaded band shows the range of uncertainty in the data, based on the number of measurements collected and the precision of the methods used. Data source: NOAA, 2024 This map shows how average sea surface temperature around the world changed between 1901 and 2022. It is based on a combination of direct measurements and satellite measurements. A black “+” symbol in the middle of a square on the map means the trend shown is statistically significant. White areas did not have enough data to calculate reliable long-term trends. Data source: NOAA, 2023 Sea surface temperature—the temperature of the water at the ocean surface—is an important physical attribute of the world’s oceans. The surface temperature of the world’s oceans varies mainly with latitude, with the warmest waters generally near the equator and the coldest waters in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. As the oceans absorb more heat, sea surface temperature increases, and the ocean circulation patterns that transport warm and cold water around the globe change. Changes in sea surface temperature can alter marine ecosystems in several ways. For example, variations in ocean temperature can affect what species of plants, animals, and microbes are present in a location, alter migration and breeding patterns, threaten sensitive ocean life such as corals, and change the frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms such as “red tide.” Over the long term, increases in sea surface temperature could also reduce the circulation patterns that bring nutrients from the deep sea to surface waters. Changes in reef habitat and nutrient supply could dramatically alter ocean ecosystems and lead to declines in fish populations, which in turn could affect people who depend on fishing for food or jobs. Many coastal areas have a large share of people who depend on income from fishing, tourism, or both. This is especially common in areas that have fewer economic alternatives, including rural counties and the United States’ Caribbean and Pacific island commonwealths and territories. Because the oceans continuously interact with the atmosphere, sea surface temperature can also have profound effects on global climate. Increases in sea surface temperature have led to an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor over the oceans. This water vapor feeds weather systems that produce precipitation, increasing the risk of heavy rain and snow (see the and indicators). Changes in sea surface temperature can shift storm tracks, potentially contributing to droughts in some areas. Increases in sea surface temperature are also expected to lengthen the growth season for certain bacteria that can contaminate seafood and cause foodborne illnesses, thereby increasing the risk of health effects. This indicator tracks average global sea surface temperature from 1880 through 2023. It also includes a map to show how change in sea surface temperature has varied across the world’s oceans from 1901 to 2022. Techniques for measuring sea surface temperature have evolved since the 1800s. For instance, the earliest data were collected by inserting a thermometer into a water sample collected by lowering a bucket from a ship. Today, temperature measurements are collected more systematically from ships, as well as at stationary and drifting buoys. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has carefully reconstructed and filtered the data in Figure 1 to correct for biases in the different collection techniques and to minimize the effects of sampling changes over various locations and times. The data are shown as anomalies, or differences, compared with the average sea surface temperature from 1971 to 2000. The map in Figure 2 was originally developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which calculated long-term trends based on a collection of published studies. Both components of this indicator are based on instrumental measurements of surface water temperature. Due to denser sampling and improvements in sampling design and measurement techniques, newer data are more precise than older data. The earlier trends shown by this indicator have less certainty because of lower sampling frequency and less precise sampling methods. Data for Figure 1 were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information and are available online at: . These data were reconstructed from measurements of water temperature, which are available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at: . Figure 2 is an updated version of a map that appeared in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report ( ), which gathered data from a variety of studies that provide the best available information about climate change."

This indicator describes trends in the amount of heat stored in the world’s oceans. This figure shows changes in heat content of the top 700 meters of the world’s oceans between 1955 and 2023. Ocean heat content is measured in joules, a unit of energy, and compared against the 1971–2000 average, which is set at zero for reference.

For reference, an increase of 1 unit on this graph (1 × 10 joules) is equal to approximately 17 times the total amount of energy used by all the people on Earth in a year (based on a total global energy supply of 606 exajoules in the year 2019, which equates to 6.06 × 10 joules). Data sources: CSIRO, 2024; IAP, 2024; MRI/JMA, 2024; NOAA, 2024 This figure shows changes in heat content of the top 2,000 meters of the world’s oceans between 1955 and 2023. Ocean heat content is measured in joules, a unit of energy, and compared against the 1971–2000 average, which is set at zero for reference. Choosing a different baseline period would not change the shape of the data over time. The lines were independently calculated using different methods by government organizations in three countries: the United States’ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), China’s Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), and the Japan Meteorological Agency’s Meteorological Research Institute (MRI/JMA). For reference, an increase of 1 unit on this graph (1 × 10 joules) is equal to approximately 17 times the total amount of energy used by all the people on Earth in a year (based on a total global energy supply of 606 exajoules in the year 2019, which equates to 6.06 × 10 joules). Data sources: IAP, 2024; MRI/JMA, 2024; NOAA, 2024 When sunlight and energy trapped by greenhouse gases reach the Earth’s surface, the world’s oceans absorb some of this energy and store it as heat. This heat is initially absorbed at the surface, but some of it eventually spreads to deeper waters. Currents also move this heat around the world. Water has a much higher heat capacity than air, meaning the oceans can absorb larger amounts of heat energy with only a slight increase in temperature. The total amount of heat stored by the oceans is called “ocean heat content,” and measurements of water temperature reflect the amount of heat in the water at a particular time and location. Ocean temperature plays an important role in the Earth’s climate system—particularly sea surface temperature (see the indicator)—because heat from ocean surface waters provides energy for storms and thereby influences weather patterns. Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are trapping more energy from the sun. Because changes in ocean systems occur over centuries, the oceans have not yet warmed as much as the atmosphere, even though they have absorbed more than 90 percent of the Earth’s extra heat over the last half-century, and even as the rate of ocean heat uptake has doubled since 1993. If not for the large heat-storage capacity provided by the oceans, the atmosphere would warm more rapidly. Increased heat absorption also changes ocean currents because many currents are driven by differences in temperature, which cause differences in density. These currents influence climate patterns and sustain ecosystems that depend on certain temperature ranges. Because water expands slightly as it gets warmer, an increase in ocean heat content will also increase the volume of water in the ocean, which is one of the major causes of the observed increases in sea level (see the indicator). For all these reasons, ocean heat content is one of the most important indicators tracking the causes and responses of a changing climate. This indicator shows trends in global ocean heat content from 1955 to 2023. Measurement data are available for the top 2,000 meters (nearly 6,600 feet) of the ocean, which accounts for nearly half of the total volume of water in the world’s oceans. This indicator also shows changes representative of the top 700 meters (nearly 2,300 feet) of the world’s oceans, where much of the observed warming has taken place. The indicator measures ocean heat content in joules, which are units of energy. Organizations around the world have calculated changes in ocean heat content based on measurements of ocean temperatures at different depths. These measurements come from a variety of instruments deployed from ships and airplanes and, more recently, underwater robots. Thus, the data must be carefully adjusted to account for differences among measurement techniques and data collection programs. Figure 1 shows four independent interpretations of essentially the same underlying data for the top 700 meters of the ocean, and Figure 2 shows three independent interpretations for the top 2,000 meters of the ocean. Data must be carefully reconstructed and filtered for biases because of different data collection techniques and uneven sampling over time and space. Various methods of correcting the data have led to slightly different versions of the ocean heat trend line. Scientists continue to compare their results and improve their estimates over time. They also test their ocean heat estimates by looking at corresponding changes in other properties of the ocean. For example, they can check to see whether observed changes in sea level match the amount of sea level rise that would be expected based on the estimated change in ocean heat. Data for this indicator were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other organizations around the world. The data were analyzed independently by researchers at NOAA, Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, China’s Institute of Atmospheric Physics, and the Japan Meteorological Agency’s Meteorological Research Institute."

Covering about 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, the world’s oceans have a two-way relationship with weather and climate. The oceans influence the weather on local to global scales, while changes in climate can fundamentally alter many properties of the oceans. This chapter examines how some of these important characteristics of the oceans have changed over time. As greenhouse gases trap more energy from the sun, the oceans are absorbing more heat, resulting in an increase in sea surface temperatures and rising sea level. Changes in ocean temperatures and currents brought about by climate change will lead to alterations in climate patterns around the world. For example, warmer waters may promote the development of stronger storms in the tropics, which can cause property damage and loss of life. The impacts associated with sea level rise and stronger storm surges are especially relevant to coastal communities. Although the oceans help reduce climate change by storing large amounts of carbon dioxide, increasing levels of dissolved carbon are changing the chemistry of seawater and making it more acidic. Increased ocean acidity makes it more difficult for certain organisms, such as corals and shellfish, to build their skeletons and shells. These effects, in turn, could substantially alter the biodiversity and productivity of ocean ecosystems. Changes in ocean systems generally occur over much longer time periods than in the atmosphere, where storms can form and dissipate in a single day. Interactions between the oceans and atmosphere occur slowly over many months to years, and so does the movement of water within the oceans, including the mixing of deep and shallow waters. Thus, trends can persist for decades, centuries, or longer. For this reason, even if greenhouse gas emissions were stabilized tomorrow, it would take many more years—decades to centuries—for the oceans to adjust to changes in the atmosphere and the climate that have already occurred."

This feature provides a closer look at trends in temperature and drought in the southwestern United States. This map shows how the average air temperature from 2000 to 2020 has differed from the long-term average (1895–2020). To provide more detailed information, each state has been divided into climate divisions, which are zones that share similar climate features. Data source: NOAA, 2021 This chart shows the percentage of land area in six southwestern states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) classified under drought conditions from 2000 through 2020. This figure uses the U.S. Drought Monitor classification system, which is described in the table in the indicator. Data source: National Drought Mitigation Center, 2021 This chart shows annual values of the Palmer Drought Severity Index, averaged over six states in the Southwest (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah). Positive values represent wetter-than-average conditions, while negative values represent drier-than-average conditions. A value between -2 and -3 indicates moderate drought, -3 to -4 is severe drought, and -4 or below indicates extreme drought. The thicker line is a nine-year weighted average. Data source: NOAA, 2021 The American Southwest might evoke images of a hot, dry landscape—a land of rock, canyons, and deserts baked by the sun. Indeed, much of this region has low annual rainfall and seasonally high temperatures that contribute to its characteristic desert climate. Yet this landscape actually supports a vast array of plants and animals, along with millions of people who call the Southwest home. All of these plants, animals, and people need water to survive. Water is already scarce in the Southwest, so every drop is a precious resource. People in the Southwest are particularly dependent on surface water supplies like Lake Mead, which are vulnerable to evaporation. Thus, even a small increase in temperature (which drives evaporation) or a decrease in precipitation in this already arid region can seriously threaten natural systems and society. Droughts also contribute to increased pest outbreaks and wildfires, both of which damage local economies, and they reduce the amount of water available for generating electricity—for example, at the Hoover Dam. While two indicators in this report present information about unusually high or low temperatures and drought on a national scale (see the indicator and the indicator), this feature highlights the Southwest because of its particular sensitivity to temperature and drought. Parts of the Southwest are also experiencing long-term reductions in mountain snowpack (see the indicator), which accounts for a large portion of the region’s water supply. This feature focuses on six states that are commonly thought of as “southwestern” and characterized at least in part by arid landscapes and scarce water supplies: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. Temperature and drought data come from a network of thousands of weather stations overseen by the National Weather Service. The map in Figure 1 shows how average annual temperatures in the Southwest from 2000 to 2020 differed from the average over the entire period since widespread temperature records became available (1895–2020). Figures 2 and 3 show two ways of measuring drought in the Southwest: the Drought Monitor and the Palmer Drought Severity Index. The Palmer Index is calculated from precipitation and temperature measurements at weather stations, and has been used widely for many years. The Drought Monitor is a more recent and more detailed index based on several other indices (including Palmer), along with additional factors such as snow water content, groundwater levels, reservoir storage, pasture/range conditions, and other impacts. See the indicator for more information about these indices. For this and other examples of community connections to observed climate-related changes, see the StoryMap at: . Natural variability, changes in irrigation practices, and other diversions of water for human use can influence certain drought-related measurements. Soil moisture, ground water, and streamflow are part of Drought Monitor calculations (Figure 2), and they are all sensitive to human activities. Data for Figures 1 and 3 were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, which maintains a large collection of climate data online at: .

Major participants include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Drought Mitigation Center. For a map of current drought conditions, visit the Drought Monitor website at: . There are many definitions and types of drought. Meteorologists generally define drought as a prolonged period of dry weather caused by a lack of precipitation that results in a serious water shortage for some activity, population, or ecological system. Drought can also be thought of as an extended imbalance between precipitation and evaporation. As average temperatures have risen because of climate change, the Earth’s water cycle has sped up through an increase in the rate of evaporation from the Earth’s surface (including soil, lakes, and reservoirs) and transpiration from plants. An increase in evapotranspiration makes more water available in the air for precipitation, but contributes to drying over some land areas, leaving less moisture in the soil. As the climate continues to change, many historically wet areas are likely to experience increased precipitation (see the indicator) and increased risk of flooding (see the indicator), while historically dry areas are likely to experience less precipitation and increased risk of drought. As a result, since the 1950s, some regions of the world have experienced an increase in some types of drought, including western North America, southern Europe, and much of Africa. Drought conditions can negatively affect agriculture, water supplies, energy production, human health, and many other aspects of society. The impacts vary depending on the type, location, intensity, and duration of the drought. For example, effects on agriculture can range from slowed plant growth to severe crop losses, while water supply impacts can range from lowered reservoir levels and dried-up streams to major water shortages. Prolonged droughts pose a particular threat to indigenous populations because of their economic and cultural dependence on land and water supplies. Warming and drought can threaten medicinal and culturally important plants and animals and can reduce water quality and availability, making tribal populations particularly vulnerable to waterborne illnesses. Lower streamflow and groundwater levels can also harm ecosystems more broadly, by harming plants and animals and increasing the risk of wildfires (see the During the 20 century, many indices were created to measure drought severity by looking at precipitation, soil moisture, stream flow, vegetation health, and other variables. Figure 1 shows annual values of the most widely used index, the Palmer Drought Severity Index, which is calculated from precipitation and temperature measurements at weather stations. An index value of zero represents the average moisture conditions observed between 1931 and 1990 at a given location. A positive value means conditions are wetter than average, while a negative value is drier than average. Index values from locations across the contiguous 48 states have been averaged together to produce the national values shown in Figure 1. Figures 2 and 3 show the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which measures the combination of water supply (precipitation) and atmospheric water demand (evapotranspiration, which is based on temperature) to determine whether a certain area is experiencing extreme drought, extreme moisture, or conditions in between. This combination of inputs is useful because it allows the SPEI to consider how droughts might affect agriculture and ecosystems, which depend on a balance between water supply and demand. SPEI values between -1 and 1 are considered near normal for a given area, whereas values below -1 signify drought and values above 1 signify unusually moist conditions. Because drought conditions fluctuate naturally, it is helpful to look at average conditions over several years to explore how drought is connected to long-term climate change. For this reason, this indicator presents average SPEI values over consecutive five-year periods. For example, the 2023 SPEI score for a particular area is actually the average of 60 months of SPEI data, from July 2018 through June 2023. For a more detailed perspective on recent trends, Figure 4 shows an index called the Drought Monitor, which is based on several indices (including Palmer), along with additional factors such as snow water content, groundwater levels, reservoir storage, pasture/range conditions, and other impacts. The Drought Monitor uses codes from D0 to D4 (see table below Figure 4) to classify drought severity. This part of the indicator covers all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Natural variability in the Earth’s climate means that drought trends may vary slightly when measured over different time periods. Using a multi-year index as shown in Figures 2 and 3 (five-year SPEI) is relevant for examining climate trends and potential connections to climate change. Periods with extreme drought conditions (e.g., 1930s) can influence the long-term trends calculated for this indicator. The SPEI values used for this indicator are based on weighted PRISM data by location. The underlying method for calculating SPEI does not account for variables such as solar radiation, humidity, and wind speed that can all influence drought conditions. As a result, the SPEI shown here is more reflective of the influence of temperature. This is a limitation and potential source of uncertainty in interpreting drought conditions. The U.S. Drought Monitor (Figure 4) offers a closer look at the percentage of the country that is affected by drought. The period of record for this index is relatively short, however, and thus too short-lived to be used for assessing long-term climate trends or exploring how recent observations compare with historical patterns. With several decades of data collection, future versions of this indicator should be able to paint a more complete picture of trends over time. Overall, this indicator gives a broad overview of drought conditions in the United States. It is not intended to replace local information that might describe conditions more precisely for a particular region. The national averages in Figures 1 and 2 are particularly limited in this regard, as averaging drought metrics over such a large area can obscure drought extremes occurring at regional scales. Thus, these national graphs might understate the degree to which droughts are becoming more severe in some areas while other places receive more rain as a result of climate change.

This indicator examines changes in the size and frequency of inland river flood events in the United States. This figure shows changes in the size of flooding events in rivers and streams in the United States between 1965 and 2015. Blue upward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become larger; brown downward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become smaller. The larger, solid-color symbols represent stations where the change was statistically significant. Data source: Slater and Villarini, 2016 This figure shows changes in the frequency of flooding events in rivers and streams in the United States between 1965 and 2015. Blue upward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become more frequent; brown downward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become less frequent. The larger, solid-color symbols represent stations where the change was statistically significant. Data source: Slater and Villarini, 2016 Rivers and streams experience flooding as a natural result of large rain storms or spring snowmelt that quickly drains into streams and rivers. Although the risk for flooding varies across the United States, most areas are susceptible to floods, even in dry and mountainous regions. The size, or magnitude, of flood events is influenced by how much water enters the waterway upstream—and how quickly. Flood frequency largely depends on the frequency of weather events. Large flood events can damage homes, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure; wipe out farmers’ crops; and harm or displace people. Although regular flooding helps to maintain the nutrient balance of soils in the flood plain, larger or more frequent floods could disrupt ecosystems by displacing aquatic life, impairing water quality, and increasing soil erosion. By inundating water treatment systems with sediment and contaminants, and promoting the growth of harmful microbes, floods can directly affect the water supplies that communities depend on. Climate change may cause river floods to become larger or more frequent than they used to be in some places, yet become smaller and less frequent in other places. As warmer temperatures cause more water to evaporate from the land and oceans, changes in the size and frequency of heavy precipitation events may in turn affect the size and frequency of river flooding (see the indicator). Changes in streamflow, the timing of snowmelt (see the indicator), and the amount of snowpack that accumulates in the winter (see the indicator) can also affect flood patterns. The U.S. Geological Survey maintains thousands of stream gauges across the United States. Each gauge measures water level and discharge—the amount of water flowing past the gauge. This indicator uses total daily discharge data from about 500 long-term stream gauge stations where trends are not substantially influenced by dams, reservoir management, wastewater treatment facilities, or land-use change. One way to determine whether the magnitude of flooding has changed is by studying the largest flood event from each year. This indicator examines the maximum discharge from every year at every station to identify whether peak flows have generally increased or decreased. This indicator also analyzes whether large flood events have become more or less frequent over time, based on daily discharge records. This indicator starts in 1965 because flood data have been available for a large number of sites to support a national-level analysis since then. This indicator is based on U.S. stream gauges that have recorded data consistently since 1965. Besides climate change, many other types of human influences could affect the frequency and magnitude of floods—for example, dams, floodwater management activities, agricultural practices, and changes in land use. To remove these influences, this indicator focuses on a set of sites that are not heavily influenced by human activities, in watersheds that do not have a large proportion of impervious surfaces such as concrete and asphalt. Increased flooding does not necessarily result in an increased risk to people or property if an area has protective infrastructure, such as levees or floodwalls. Daily stream gauge data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. These data came from a set of gauges in watersheds with minimal human impacts, which have been classified as reference gauges. Daily discharge data are stored in the National Water Information System and are publicly available at: ."

Data source: NOAA, 2023 This figure presents annual values of the Power Dissipation Index (PDI), which accounts for cyclone strength, duration, and frequency. Tropical North Atlantic sea surface temperature trends are provided for reference. Note that sea surface temperature is measured in different units, but the values have been plotted alongside the PDI to show how they compare. The lines have been smoothed using a five-year weighted average, plotted at the middle year. The most recent average (2018–2022) is plotted at 2020. Data source: Emanuel, 2023 Hurricanes, tropical storms, and other intense rotating storms fall into a general category called cyclones. There are two main types of cyclones: tropical and extratropical (those that form outside the tropics). Tropical cyclones get their energy from warm tropical oceans. Extratropical cyclones get their energy from the jet stream and from temperature differences between cold, dry air masses from higher latitudes and warm, moist air masses from lower latitudes. This indicator focuses on tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. Tropical cyclones are most common during the “hurricane season,” which runs from June through November. The effects of tropical cyclones are numerous and well known. At sea, storms disrupt and endanger shipping traffic. When cyclones encounter land, their intense rains and high winds can cause severe property and infrastructure damage, loss of life, soil erosion, and flooding. The associated storm surge—the large volume of ocean water pushed toward shore by the cyclone’s strong winds—can cause severe flooding, erosion, and destruction. Climate change is expected to affect tropical cyclones by increasing sea surface temperatures, a key factor that influences cyclone formation and behavior. The U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change project that tropical cyclones will become more intense over the 21 century, with higher wind speeds and heavier rains. Records of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean have been collected since the 1800s. The most reliable long-term records focus on hurricanes, which are the strongest category of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, with wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour. This indicator uses historical data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to track the number of hurricanes per year in the North Atlantic (north of the equator) and the number reaching the United States since 1878. Some hurricanes over the ocean might have been missed before the start of aircraft and satellite observation, so scientists have used other evidence, such as ship traffic records, to estimate the actual number of hurricanes that might have formed in earlier years. This indicator also looks at the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index and the Power Dissipation Index (PDI), which are two ways of monitoring the frequency, strength, and duration of tropical cyclones based on wind speed measurements. Every cyclone has an ACE Index value, which is a number based on the maximum wind speed measured at six-hour intervals over the entire time that the cyclone is classified as at least a tropical storm (wind speed of at least 39 miles per hour). Therefore, a storm’s ACE Index value accounts for both strength and duration. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calculates the total ACE Index value for an entire hurricane season by adding the values for all named storms, including subtropical storms, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The resulting annual total accounts for cyclone strength, duration, and frequency. For this indicator, the index has been converted to a scale where 100 equals the median value (the midpoint) over a base period from 1951 to 2020. The thresholds in Figure 2 define whether the ACE Index for a given year is close to normal, significantly above normal, or significantly below normal. Like the ACE Index, the PDI is based on measurements of wind speed, but it uses a different calculation method that places more emphasis on storm intensity. This indicator shows the annual PDI value, which represents the sum of PDI values for all named storms during the year. Over time, data collection methods have changed as technology has improved. For example, wind speed collection methods have evolved substantially over the past 60 years, while aircraft reconnaissance began in 1944 and satellite tracking around 1966. Figure 1 shows how older hurricane counts have been adjusted to attempt to account for the lack of aircraft and satellite observations. Changes in data gathering technologies could substantially influence the overall patterns in Figures 2 and 3. The effects of these changes on data consistency over the life of the indicator would benefit from additional research. While Figures 2 and 3 cover several different aspects of tropical cyclones, there are other important factors not covered here, including the size of each storm, the amount of rain, and the height of the storm surge. The reason for the recent divergence between cyclone activity and sea surface temperature in Figure 3 has not been identified conclusively, but it may relate to other factors that influence the formation of storms, such as the difference in wind speeds at different levels in the atmosphere (called vertical wind shear) and the concentration of particles called aerosols in the atmosphere. Hurricane counts were compiled using methods described in Knutson et al. (2010). Data for Figures 1 and 2 came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Research Division, and are available online at: . Values for Figure 3 have been calculated by Kerry Emanuel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both the ACE Index and the PDI are based on wind speed measurements compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

This figure shows how the total annual amount of precipitation in the contiguous 48 states has changed since 1901. This graph uses the 1901–2000 average as a baseline for depicting change. Choosing a different baseline period would not change the shape of the data over time.

This graph uses the 1901–2000 average as a baseline for depicting change. Choosing a different baseline period would not change the shape of the data over time. Data source: NOAA, 2024 This figure shows the percent change in total annual precipitation in different parts of the United States since the early 20 century (since 1901 for the contiguous 48 states and 1925 for Alaska). The data are shown for climate divisions, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Data source: NOAA, 2024 Precipitation can have wide-ranging effects on human well-being and ecosystems. Rainfall, snowfall, and the timing of snowmelt can all affect the amount of surface water and groundwater available for drinking, irrigation, and industry. They also influence river flooding and can determine what types of animals and plants (including crops) can survive in a particular place. Changes in precipitation can disrupt a wide range of natural processes, particularly if these changes occur more quickly than plant and animal species can adapt. As average temperatures at the Earth’s surface rise (see the indicator), more evaporation and transpiration occur, adding more moisture to the air, which in turn increases overall precipitation. Therefore, a warming climate is expected to increase precipitation in many areas. Just as precipitation patterns vary across the world, however, so do the effects of climate change on precipitation. By shifting the wind patterns and ocean currents that drive the world’s climate system, climate change will also cause some areas to experience decreased precipitation. In addition, areas with increased precipitation will not necessarily have more water available for people and ecosystems because higher temperatures also lead to more evaporation (see the indicator). This indicator examines U.S. and global precipitation patterns, based on rainfall and snowfall measurements from land-based weather stations worldwide. This indicator starts at 1901 except for the detailed map of Alaska, where reliable statewide records are available back to 1925. The indicator extends through 2023. This indicator shows annual anomalies, or differences, compared with the average precipitation from 1901 to 2000. At each weather station, annual precipitation anomalies were calculated from total annual precipitation in inches. Anomalies for the contiguous 48 states and Alaska have been determined by calculating average precipitation anomalies for areas within each state based on station density and topography. These regional anomalies are then averaged together in proportion to their area to develop national results. Similarly, global anomalies have been determined by dividing the world into a grid, averaging the data for each cell of the grid, and then averaging the grid cells together. Data from the early 20 century are somewhat less precise because there were fewer stations collecting measurements at the time. To ensure that overall trends are reliable, the data have been adjusted where possible to account for any biases that might be introduced by factors such as station relocation or changes in measurement instruments. Hawai'i and U.S. territories are not included, due to limitations in available data. The data for this indicator were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, which maintains a large collection of climate data online at: .

This indicator tracks the frequency of heavy precipitation events in the United States. This figure shows the percentage of the land area of the contiguous 48 states where a much greater than normal portion of total annual precipitation has come from extreme single-day precipitation events. The bars represent individual years, while the line is a nine-year weighted average. Data source: NOAA, 2024 This figure shows the percentage of the land area of the contiguous 48 states that experienced much greater than normal precipitation in any given year, which means it scored 2.0 or above on the annual Standardized Precipitation Index. The thicker line shows a nine-year weighted average that smooths out some of the year-to-year fluctuations. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \"Heavy precipitation\" refers to instances during which the amount of rain or snow experienced in a location substantially exceeds what is normal. What constitutes a period of heavy precipitation varies according to location and season. Climate change can affect the intensity and frequency of precipitation. Warmer oceans increase the amount of water that evaporates into the air. When more moisture-laden air moves over land or converges into a storm system, it can produce more intense precipitation—for example, heavier rain and snow storms. The potential impacts of heavy precipitation include crop damage, soil erosion, and an increase in flood risk due to heavy rains (see the indicator)—which in turn can lead to injuries, drownings, respiratory health impacts from exposure to mold, and other flooding-related effects on health. In addition, runoff from precipitation can impair water quality as pollutants deposited on land wash into water bodies. Heavy precipitation does not necessarily mean the total amount of precipitation at a location has increased—just that precipitation is occurring in more intense events. However, changes in the intensity of precipitation, when combined with changes in the interval between precipitation events, can also lead to changes in overall precipitation totals. Heavy precipitation events can be measured by tracking their frequency, examining their return period (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or directly measuring the amount of precipitation in a certain period (for example, inches of rain falling in a 24-hour period). One way to track heavy precipitation is by calculating what percentage of a particular location’s total precipitation in a given year has come in the form of extreme one-day events—or, in other words, what percentage of precipitation is arriving in more concentrated periods of time. Figure 1 of this indicator looks at the prevalence of extreme single-day precipitation events over time. For added insight, this indicator also tracks the occurrence of unusually high total yearly precipitation. It does so by looking at the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), which compares actual yearly precipitation totals with the range of precipitation totals that one would typically expect at a specific location, based on historical data. If a location experiences less precipitation than normal during a particular period, it will receive a negative SPI score, while a period with more precipitation than normal will receive a positive score. The more precipitation (compared with normal), the higher the SPI score. The SPI is a useful way to look at precipitation totals because it allows comparison of different locations and different seasons on a standard scale. Figure 2 shows what percentage of the total area of the contiguous 48 states had an annual SPI score of 2.0 or above (well above normal) in any given year. Weather monitoring stations tend to be closer together in the eastern and central states than in the western states. In areas with fewer monitoring stations, heavy precipitation indicators are less likely to reflect local conditions accurately. The data used for this indicator come from a large national network of weather stations and were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Centers for Environmental Information. Figure 1 is based on Step #4 of NOAA’s U.S. Climate Extremes Index; for data and a description of the index, see: . Figure 2 is based on the U.S. SPI, which is shown in a variety of maps available online at: . The data used to construct these maps are available at: ."

This indicator describes trends in multi-day extreme heat events across the United States. This figure shows changes in the number of heat waves per year (frequency); the average length of heat waves in days (duration); the number of days between the first and last heat wave of the year (season length); and how hot the heat waves were, compared with the local temperature threshold for defining a heat wave (intensity). These data were analyzed from 1961 to 2023 for 50 large metropolitan areas. The graphs show averages across all 50 metropolitan areas by decade. Data source: NOAA, 2024 These maps show changes in the number of heat waves per year (frequency); the average length of heat waves in days (duration); the number of days between the first and last heat wave of the year (season length); and how hot the heat waves were, compared with the local temperature threshold for defining a heat wave (intensity). These data were analyzed from 1961 to 2023 for 50 large metropolitan areas. The size of each circle indicates the total change over the period measured. Solid-color circles represent cities where the trend was statistically significant. Data source: NOAA, 2024 This figure shows the annual values of the U.S. Heat Wave Index from 1895 to 2021. These data cover the contiguous 48 states. An index value of 0.2 (for example) could mean that 20 percent of the country experienced one heat wave, 10 percent of the country experienced two heat waves, or some other combination of frequency and area resulted in this value. Data source: Kunkel, 2022 A persistent period of unusually hot days is referred to as an extreme heat event or a heat wave. Heat waves are more than just uncomfortable: they can lead to illness and death, particularly among older adults, the very young, and other vulnerable populations (see the and indicators). Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to other impacts as well—for example, damaging crops, injuring or killing livestock, and increasing the risk of wildfires. Prolonged periods of extreme heat can lead to power outages as heavy demands for air conditioning strain the power grid. Unusually hot days and heat wave events are a natural part of day-to-day variation in weather. As the Earth’s climate warms, however, hotter-than-usual days and nights are becoming more common (see the indicator) and heat waves are expected to last longer and become more frequent and intense. Increases in these extreme heat events can lead to more heat-related illnesses and deaths, especially if people and communities do not take steps to adapt. Even small increases in extreme heat can result in increased deaths and illnesses. This indicator examines trends over time in four key characteristics of heat waves in the United States: Heat waves can be defined in many different ways. For consistency across the country, Figures 1 and 2 define a heat wave as a period of two or more consecutive days when the daily minimum apparent temperature (the actual temperature adjusted for humidity) in a particular city exceeds the 85 percentile of historical July and August temperatures (1981–2010) for that city. EPA chose this definition for several reasons: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) calculated apparent temperature for this indicator based on temperature and humidity measurements from long-term weather stations, which are generally located at airports. Figures 1 and 2 focus on the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas that have recorded weather data from a consistent location without many missing days over the time period examined. The year 1961 was chosen as the starting point because most major cities have collected consistent data since at least that time. Figure 3 provides another perspective to gauge the size and frequency of prolonged heat wave events. It shows the U.S. Annual Heat Wave Index, which tracks the occurrence of heat wave conditions across the contiguous 48 states from 1895 to 2021. This index defines a heat wave as a period lasting at least four days with an average temperature that would only be expected to persist over four days once every 10 years, based on the historical record. The index value for a given year depends on how often such severe heat waves occur and how widespread they are. As cities develop, vegetation is often lost, and more surfaces are paved or covered with buildings. This type of development can lead to higher temperatures—part of an effect called an “urban heat island.” Compared with surrounding rural areas, built-up areas have higher temperatures, especially at night. Urban growth since 1961 may have contributed to part of the increase in heat waves that Figures 1 and 2 show for certain cities. This indicator does not attempt to adjust for the effects of development in metropolitan areas, because it focuses on the temperatures to which people are actually exposed, regardless of whether the trends reflect a combination of climate change and other factors. Figures 1 and 2 focus on the 50 most populous metropolitan areas that had complete data for the entire period from 1961 to 2023. Several large metropolitan areas did not have enough data, such as New York City, Houston, Minneapolis–St. Paul, and Denver. In some of these cases, the best available long-term weather station was relocated sometime between 1961 and 2023—for example, when a new airport opened. As noted above, Figures 1 and 2 focus on daily minimum temperatures because of the connection between nighttime cooling (or lack thereof) and human health. For reference, EPA’s technical documentation for this indicator shows the results of a similar analysis based on daily maximum temperatures. Temperature data are less certain for the early part of the 20 century because fewer stations were operating at that time. In addition, measuring devices and methods have changed over time, and some stations have moved. The data in Figure 3 have been adjusted to the extent possible to account for some of these influences and biases, however, and these uncertainties are not sufficient to change the fundamental nature of the trends. Figures 1 and 2 are adapted from an analysis by Habeeb et al. (2015). They are based on temperature and humidity measurements from weather stations managed by NOAA’s National Weather Service. NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information compiled and provided the data. Figure 3 is based on measurements from weather stations in the National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Network. The data are available online at: .

In this case, the term “unusually hot” refers to a daily maximum temperature that is hotter than the 95 percentile temperature during the 1948–2023 period. Thus, the maximum temperature on a particular day at a particular station would be considered “unusually hot” if it falls within the warmest 5 percent of measurements at that station during the 1948–2023 period. The map shows changes in the total number of days per year that were hotter than the 95 percentile. Red upward-pointing symbols show where these unusually hot days are becoming more common.

Data source: NOAA, 2024 This map shows trends in unusually cold temperatures at individual weather stations that have operated consistently since 1948. In this case, the term “unusually cold” refers to a daily minimum temperature that is colder than the 5 percentile temperature during the 1948–2023 period. Thus, the minimum temperature on a particular day at a particular station would be considered “unusually cold” if it falls within the coldest 5 percent of measurements at that station during the 1948–2023 period. The map shows changes in the total number of days per year that were colder than the 5 percentile. Blue upward-pointing symbols show where these unusually cold days are becoming more common. Red downward-pointing symbols show where unusually cold days are becoming less common. Data source: NOAA, 2024 This figure shows the percentage of daily temperature records set at weather stations across the contiguous 48 states by decade. Record highs (red) are compared with record lows (blue). Data source: Meehl et al., 2009 Unusually hot or cold temperatures can result in prolonged extreme weather events like summer heat waves (see the indicator) or winter cold spells. Heat waves can lead to illness and death, particularly among older adults, the very young, and other vulnerable populations (see the and indicators). People can also die from exposure to extreme cold (hypothermia) (see the indicator). In addition, prolonged exposure to excessive heat and cold can damage crops and injure or kill livestock. Extreme heat can lead to power outages as heavy demands for air conditioning strain the power grid, while extremely cold weather increases the need for heating fuel. Record-setting daily temperatures, heat waves, and cold spells are a natural part of day-to-day variation in weather. As the Earth’s climate warms overall, however, temperatures that are unusually hot for a given location are expected to increase. Higher values of the heat index (which combines temperature and humidity to describe perceived temperature) are expected to increase discomfort and aggravate health issues. Conversely, cold spells are expected to decrease. In most locations, scientists expect the number of warm days and warm nights to increase. This change will provide less opportunity to cool off and recover from daytime heat. This indicator examines trends in unusual temperatures from several perspectives: The data come from thousands of weather stations across the United States. National patterns can be determined by dividing the country into a grid and examining the data for one station in each cell of the grid. This method ensures that the results are not biased toward regions that happen to have many stations close together. Figures 1 and 2 show trends in the percentage of the country’s area experiencing unusually hot temperatures in the summer and unusually cold temperatures in the winter. These graphs are based on daily maximum temperatures, which usually occur during the day, and daily minimum temperatures, which usually occur at night. At each station, the recorded highs and lows are compared with the full set of historical records. After averaging over a particular month or season of interest, the coldest 10 percent of years are considered “unusually cold” and the warmest 10 percent are “unusually hot.” For example, if last year’s summer highs were the 10 warmest on record for a particular location with more than 100 years of data, that year’s summer highs would be considered unusually warm. Data are available from 1910 to 2023 for summer (June through August) and from 1911 to 2024 for winter (December of the previous year through February). Figures 3 and 4 show how trends in unusually hot and cold daily temperatures throughout the year vary by location. These maps cover about 1,050 weather stations that have operated since 1948. Figure 3 was created by reviewing all daily maximum temperatures from 1948 to 2023 and identifying the 95 percentile temperature (a temperature that one would only expect to exceed in five days out of every 100) at each station. Next, for each year, the total number of days with maximum temperatures higher than the 95 percentile (that is, unusually hot days) was determined. The map shows how the total number of unusually hot days per year at each station has changed over time. Figure 4 is similar except that it looks at unusually cold days, based on the 5 percentile of daily minimum temperatures and reviews daily minimum winter temperatures from 1911 to 2023. Many people are familiar with record daily high and low temperatures, which are frequently mentioned in weather reports. Figure 5 depicts trends in these records by comparing the number of record-setting highs with the number of record-setting lows by decade. These data come from a set of weather stations that have collected data consistently since 1950. Temperature data are less certain for the early part of the 20 century because fewer stations were operating at that time. In addition, measuring devices and methods have changed over time, and some stations have moved. The data have been adjusted to the extent possible to account for some of these influences and biases, however, and these uncertainties are not sufficient to change the fundamental trends shown in the figures. The data for this indicator are based on measurements from weather stations managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figures 1 and 2 come from the U.S. Climate Extremes Index, which is based on a smaller group of long-term weather stations that are tracked by the National Centers for Environmental Information and referred to as the U.S. Historical Climatology Network. Figures 3 and 4 use data from a somewhat larger set of stations tracked by the National Centers for Environmental Information, known as the Global Historical Climatology Network.

This graph uses the 1901–2000 average as a baseline for depicting change. Choosing a different baseline period would not change the shape of the data over time. Data source: NOAA, 2024 This figure shows how annual average air temperatures have changed in different parts of the United States since the early 20 century (since 1901 for the contiguous 48 states and 1925 for Alaska). The data are shown for climate divisions, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Data source: NOAA, 2024 Temperature is a fundamental measurement for describing the climate, and the temperature in particular places can have wide-ranging effects on human life and ecosystems. For example, increases in air temperature can lead to more intense heat waves (see the indicator), which can cause illness and death, especially in vulnerable populations. Annual and seasonal temperature patterns also determine the types of animals and plants that can survive in particular locations. Changes in temperature can disrupt a wide range of natural processes, particularly if these changes occur more quickly than plant and animal species can adapt. Concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are increasing in the Earth’s atmosphere (see the indicator). In response, average temperatures at the Earth’s surface are increasing and are expected to continue rising. Because climate change can shift the wind patterns and ocean currents that drive the world’s climate system, some areas are warming more than others, and some have experienced cooling. This indicator examines U.S. and global surface temperature patterns over time. U.S. surface measurements come from weather stations on land, while global surface measurements also incorporate observations from buoys and ships on the ocean, thereby providing data from sites spanning much of the surface of the Earth. This indicator starts at 1901 except for the detailed map of Alaska, where reliable statewide records are available back to 1925. For comparison, this indicator also displays satellite measurements that can be used to estimate the temperature of the Earth’s lower atmosphere since 1979. This indicator shows annual anomalies, or differences, compared with the average temperature from 1901 to 2000. For example, an anomaly of +2.0 degrees means the average temperature was 2 degrees higher than the long-term average. Anomalies have been calculated for each weather station. Daily temperature measurements at each site were used to calculate monthly anomalies, which were then averaged to find an annual temperature anomaly for each year. Anomalies for the contiguous 48 states and Alaska have been determined by calculating average anomalies for areas within each state based on station density, interpolation, and topography. These regional anomalies are then averaged together in proportion to their area to develop national results. Similarly, global anomalies have been determined by dividing the world into a grid, averaging the data for each cell of the grid, and then averaging the grid cells together. Data from the early 20 century are somewhat less precise than more recent data because there were fewer stations collecting measurements at the time, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. The overall trends are still reliable, however. Where possible, the data have been adjusted to account for any biases that might be introduced by factors such as station moves, urbanization near the station, changes in measuring instruments, and changes in the exact times at which measurements are taken. Hawaii and U.S. territories are not included, due to limitations in available data. The data for this indicator were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, which maintains a large collection of climate data online at: . The surface temperature anomalies shown here were calculated based on monthly values from a network of long-term monitoring stations. Satellite data were analyzed by two independent groups—the Global Hydrology and Climate Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and Remote Sensing Systems (RSS)—resulting in slightly different trend lines."

This graph uses the 1901–2000 average as a baseline for depicting change. Choosing a different baseline period would not change the shape of the data over time. Data source: NOAA, 2024 These maps show the total change in the average seasonal temperature for each of the contiguous 48 states from 1896 to 2023, in degrees Fahrenheit. Total change in temperature was calculated from the long-term average rate of change. Seasons are defined as follows: December, January, and February for winter; March, April, and May for spring; June, July, and August for summer; and September, October, and November for fall. Data source: NOAA, 2024 This figure shows changes in the average annual temperature by season for the contiguous 48 states from 1896 to 2023, in degrees Fahrenheit. Seasons are defined as follows: December, January, and February for winter; March, April, and May for spring; June, July, and August for summer; and September, October, and November for fall. Data source: NOAA, 2024 As the Earth warms overall, average temperatures increase throughout the year (see the indicator), but the increases may be larger in certain seasons than in others. The winter is particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures. Overall, minimum temperatures have increased at a higher rate than average maximum temperatures. Much of the observed warming in the United States has taken place when and where it is usually the coldest—namely, during winter, at night, and in the northern parts of the country. Although the United States has experienced many winters with unusually low temperatures, unusually cold winter temperatures have become less common—particularly very cold nights (lows) (see also the indicator). Changing winter temperatures directly influence the amount of snow that falls and accumulates, amount of seasonal snowpack, timing of snowmelt runoff, loss of soil moisture through evapotranspiration, and amount of time that lakes are frozen (see the , , and indicators). These changes are reducing water supplies—particularly in western states that depend heavily on snowpack—and threatening winter recreation and tourism, an industry worth $12 to 20 billion a year in the United States. Warming in other seasons can also affect daily life in various ways. For example, warmer spring and fall temperatures extend the growing season (see the indicator), which can benefit some forms of agriculture but also lead to a longer and more intense pollen season for allergy sufferers (see the indicator). These changes could also extend the wildfire season. A warmer summer likely means more money spent on air conditioning, while a warmer winter could mean less money spent on home heating (see the indicator). Seasonal warming could also disrupt the timing of events that are important for plants and animals, such as budding, flower blooms, hibernation, egg-laying, hatching, and migration. This indicator examines changes in average temperatures in each season, defined here by calendar month (for example, winter is December, January, and February). The indicator is based on daily temperature measurements from more than 10,000 weather stations located across the contiguous 48 states. Starting in 1896, this indicator shows annual anomalies, or differences, compared with the long-term average seasonal temperatures from 1901 to 2000 (Figure 1). For example, an anomaly of +2.0°F in a winter means the average winter temperature was 2 degrees higher than the long-term average. Anomalies have been calculated for each weather station. Daily temperature measurements at each site were used to calculate monthly anomalies, which were then averaged for each season to find temperature anomalies for each year. Average anomalies are calculated for areas within each state based on station density and proximity, as well as the topography of the area. These sub-state-level anomalies are then averaged together in proportion to their area to develop state and national results. Data from the early part of the time period are somewhat less precise than more recent data because there were fewer stations collecting measurements at the time. The overall trends are still reliable, however. Where possible, the data have been adjusted to account for any biases that might be introduced by factors such as station moves, urbanization near the station, changes in measuring instruments, and changes in the exact times at which measurements are taken. Alaska, Hawai'i, and U.S. territories are not included, due to limitations in available data. The data for this indicator were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, which maintains a large collection of climate data online at: ."

Rising global average temperature is associated with widespread changes in weather patterns. Scientific studies indicate that extreme weather events such as heat waves and large storms are likely to become more frequent or more intense with human-induced climate change. This chapter focuses on observed changes in temperature, precipitation, storms, floods, and droughts. Long-term changes in climate can directly or indirectly affect many aspects of society in potentially disruptive ways. For example, warmer average temperatures could increase air conditioning costs and affect the spread of diseases like Lyme disease, but could also improve conditions for growing some crops. More extreme variations in weather are also a threat to society. More frequent and intense extreme heat events can increase illnesses and deaths, especially among vulnerable populations, and damage some crops. While increased precipitation can replenish water supplies and support agriculture, intense storms can damage property, cause loss of life and population displacement, and temporarily disrupt essential services such as transportation, telecommunications, energy, and water supplies. is the state of the atmosphere at any given time and place. Most of the weather that affects people, agriculture, and ecosystems takes place in the lower layer of the atmosphere. Familiar aspects of weather include temperature, precipitation, clouds, and wind that people experience throughout the course of a day. Severe weather conditions include hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and droughts. is the long-term average of the weather in a given place. While the weather can change in minutes or hours, a change in climate is something that develops over longer periods of decades to centuries. Climate is defined not only by average temperature and precipitation but also by the type, frequency, duration, and intensity of weather events such as heat waves, cold spells, storms, floods, and droughts. The concepts of climate and weather are often confused, so it may be helpful to think about the difference between weather and climate with an analogy: weather influences what clothes you wear on a given day, while the climate where you live influences the entire wardrobe you buy."

This indicator describes how the levels of major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have changed over time. This figure shows concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2023, measured in parts per million (ppm). The data come from a variety of historical ice core studies and recent air monitoring sites around the world. Each line represents a different data source. Data source: Compilation of eight underlying datasets This figure shows concentrations of methane in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2023, measured in parts per billion (ppb). The data come from a variety of historical ice core studies and recent air monitoring sites around the world. Each line represents a different data source. Data source: Compilation of five underlying datasets This figure shows concentrations of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2023, measured in parts per billion (ppb). The data come from a variety of historical ice core studies and recent air monitoring sites around the world. Each line represents a different data source. Data source: Compilation of six underlying datasets This figure shows concentrations of several halogenated gases (which contain fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) in the atmosphere, measured in parts per trillion (ppt). The data come from monitoring sites around the world. Note that the scale increases by factors of 10. This is because the concentrations of different halogenated gases can vary by a few orders of magnitude. The numbers following the name of each gas (e.g., HCFC-22) are used to denote specific types of those particular gases. Data sources: AGAGE, 2022; NOAA, 2023; Rigby, 2017 This figure shows the average amount of ozone in the Earth’s atmosphere each year, based on satellite measurements. The total represents the “thickness” or density of ozone throughout all layers of the Earth’s atmosphere, which is called total column ozone and measured in Dobson units. Higher numbers indicate more ozone. For most years, Figure 5 shows how this ozone is divided between the troposphere (the part of the atmosphere closest to the ground) and the stratosphere. From 1994 to 1996, only the total is available, due to limited satellite coverage. Data sources: NASA, 2013, 2021, 2022 Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Human activities have only a small direct influence on atmospheric concentrations of water vapor, primarily through irrigation and deforestation, so it is not included in this indicator. The surface warming caused by human production of other greenhouse gases, however, leads to an increase in atmospheric water vapor because warmer temperatures make it easier for water to evaporate and stay in the air in vapor form. This creates a positive “feedback loop” in which warming leads to more warming. Since the Industrial Revolution began in the 1700s, people have added a substantial amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests, and conducting other activities (see the and Greenhouse Gas Emissions indicators). When greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, many remain there for long time periods ranging from a decade to many millennia. Over time, these gases are removed from the atmosphere by chemical reactions or by emissions sinks, such as the oceans and vegetation, which absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. As a result of human activities, however, these gases are entering the atmosphere more quickly than they are being removed from it, and thus their concentrations are increasing. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and certain manufactured gases called halogenated gases (gases that contain chlorine, fluorine, or bromine) become well mixed throughout the global atmosphere because of their relatively long lifetimes and because of transport by winds. Concentrations of these greenhouse gases are measured in parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb), or parts per trillion (ppt) by volume. In other words, a concentration of 1 ppb for a given gas means there is one molecule of that gas in every 1 billion molecules of air. Some halogenated gases are considered major greenhouse gases due to their very high global warming potentials and long atmospheric lifetimes even if they only exist at a few ppt ( ). This indicator looks at global average levels of ozone in both the stratosphere and troposphere. For trends in ground-level ozone concentrations within the United States, see EPA’s at: . Ozone is also a greenhouse gas, but it differs from other greenhouse gases in several ways. The effects of ozone depend on its altitude, or where the gas is located vertically in the atmosphere. Most ozone naturally exists in the layer of the atmosphere called the stratosphere, which ranges from approximately 6 to 30 miles above the Earth’s surface. Ozone in the stratosphere has a slight net warming effect on the planet, but it is good for life on Earth because it absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, preventing it from reaching the Earth’s surface. In the troposphere—the layer of the atmosphere near ground level—ozone is an air pollutant that is harmful to breathe, a main ingredient of urban smog, and an important greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change (see the indicator). Unlike the other major greenhouse gases, tropospheric ozone only lasts for days to weeks, so levels often vary by location and by season. This indicator describes concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It focuses on the major greenhouse gases that result from human activities. For carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and halogenated gases, recent measurements come from monitoring stations around the world, while measurements of older air come from air bubbles trapped in layers of ice from Antarctica and Greenland. By determining the age of the ice layers and the concentrations of gases trapped inside, scientists can learn what the atmosphere was like thousands of years ago. This indicator also shows data from satellite instruments that measure ozone density in the troposphere, the stratosphere, and the “total column,” or all layers of the atmosphere. These satellite data are routinely compared with ground-based instruments to confirm their accuracy. Ozone data have been averaged worldwide for each year to smooth out the regional and seasonal variations. This indicator includes several of the most important halogenated gases, but some others are not shown. Many other halogenated gases are also greenhouse gases, but Figure 4 is limited to a set of common examples that represent most of the major types of these gases. The indicator also does not address certain other pollutants that can affect climate by either reflecting or absorbing energy. For example, sulfate particles can reflect sunlight away from the Earth, while black carbon aerosols (soot) absorb energy. Data for nitrogen trifluoride (Figure 4) reflect modeled averages based on measurements made in the Northern Hemisphere and some locations in the Southern Hemisphere, to represent global average concentrations over time. The global averages for ozone only cover the area between 50°N and 50°S latitude (77 percent of the Earth’s surface), because at higher latitudes the lack of sunlight in winter creates data gaps and the angle of incoming sunlight during the rest of the year reduces the accuracy of the satellite measuring technique. Global atmospheric concentration measurements for carbon dioxide (Figure 1), methane (Figure 2), and nitrous oxide (Figure 3) come from a variety of monitoring programs and studies published in peer-reviewed literature. Global atmospheric concentration data for selected halogenated gases (Figure 4) were compiled by the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A similar figure with many of these gases appears in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report. Satellite measurements of ozone were processed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and validated using ground-based measurements collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

This indicator measures the “radiative forcing” or heating effect caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This figure shows the amount of radiative forcing caused by various greenhouse gases, based on the change in concentration of these gases in the Earth’s atmosphere since 1750. Radiative forcing is calculated in watts per square meter, which represents the size of the energy imbalance in the atmosphere. On the right side of the graph, radiative forcing has been converted to the Annual Greenhouse Gas Index, which is set to a value of 1.0 for 1990. Data source: NOAA, 2020 This figure shows the total amount of radiative forcing caused by human activities—including indirect effects—between 1750 and 2011. Radiative forcing is calculated in watts per square meter, which represents the size of the energy imbalance in the atmosphere. Each colored bar represents scientists’ best estimate, while the thin black bars indicate the likely range of possibilities. The natural change in the energy received from the sun over this time period is provided for reference. Data source: IPCC, 2013 When energy from the sun reaches the Earth, the planet absorbs some of this energy and radiates the rest back to space as heat. The Earth’s surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and outgoing energy. Average conditions tend to remain stable unless the Earth experiences a force that shifts the energy balance. A shift in the energy balance causes the Earth’s average temperature to become warmer or cooler, leading to a variety of other changes in the lower atmosphere, on land, and in the oceans. A variety of physical and chemical changes can affect the global energy balance and force changes in the Earth’s climate. Some of these changes are natural, while others are influenced by humans. These changes are measured by the amount of warming or cooling they can produce, which is called “radiative forcing.” Changes that have a warming effect are called “positive” forcing, while changes that have a cooling effect are called “negative” forcing. When positive and negative forces are out of balance, the result is a change in the Earth’s average surface temperature. Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere affect radiative forcing (see the indicator). Greenhouse gases absorb energy that radiates upward from the Earth’s surface, re-emitting heat to the lower atmosphere and warming the Earth’s surface. Human activities have led to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases that can remain in the atmosphere for decades, centuries, or longer, so the corresponding warming effects will last for a long time. Figure 1 of this indicator measures the average total radiative forcing of 20 long-lived greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The results were calculated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) based on measured concentrations of the gases in the atmosphere, compared with the concentrations that were present around 1750, before the Industrial Revolution began. Because each gas has a different ability to absorb and emit energy, this indicator converts the changes in greenhouse gas concentrations into a measure of the total radiative forcing (warming effect) caused by each gas. Radiative forcing is calculated in watts per square meter, which represents the size of the energy imbalance in the atmosphere. NOAA also translates the total radiative forcing of these measured gases into an index value called the Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (right side of Figure 1). This number compares the radiative forcing for a particular year with the radiative forcing in 1990, which is a common baseline year for global agreements to track and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For reference, this indicator also presents an estimate of the total radiative forcing associated with a variety of human activities from 1750 to the present. Figure 2 shows the influence of: The index in Figure 1 does not include short-lived greenhouse gases like tropospheric ozone, reflective aerosol particles, black carbon (soot), or the indirect influence of methane through its effects on water vapor and ozone formation. Figure 2 includes these and other indirect influences. Data for Figure 1 were provided by NOAA. This figure and other information are available at: . Data for Figure 2 came from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), which publishes assessment reports based on the best available climate science data."

This indicator describes emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States. This figure shows emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and several fluorinated gases in the United States from 1990 to 2022. For consistency, emissions are expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. Data source: U.S. EPA, 2024 This figure shows greenhouse gas emissions and sinks (negative values) by source in the United States from 1990 to 2022. For consistency, emissions are expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. All electric power emissions are grouped together in the “Electric power” sector, so other sectors such as “Residential” and “Commercial” are only showing non-electric sources, such as burning oil or gas for heating. Totals do not match Figure 1 exactly because the economic sectors shown here do not include emissions from U.S. territories outside the 50 states. Data source: U.S. EPA, 2024 This figure shows trends in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2022 per capita (heavy orange line), based on the total U.S. population (thin orange line). It also shows trends in emissions per dollar of real GDP (heavy blue line). Real GDP (thin blue line) is the value of all goods and services produced in the country during a given year, adjusted for inflation. All data are indexed to 1990 as the base year, which is assigned a value of 100. For instance, a real GDP value of 217 in the year 2022 would represent a 117 percent increase since 1990. Data source: U.S. EPA, 2024 A number of factors influence the quantities of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, including economic activity, population, consumption patterns, energy prices, land use, and technology. There are several ways to track these emissions, such as by measuring emissions directly, calculating emissions based on the amount of fuel that people burn, and estimating other activities and their associated emissions. EPA has two key programs that provide data on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States: the and the . See “ ” to learn more about these programs. This indicator focuses on emissions and removals of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and several fluorinated gases—all important greenhouse gases that are influenced by human activities. These particular gases are covered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the more recent Paris Agreement, which are international agreements that require participating countries to develop and regularly submit an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. Data and analysis for this indicator come from EPA’s annual inventory submission, the . This indicator is restricted to emissions and removals associated with human activities. It starts in 1990, which is a common base year for global agreements to track and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Each greenhouse gas has a different lifetime (how long it stays in the atmosphere) and a different ability to trap heat in our atmosphere. To allow different gases to be compared and added together, emissions are converted into carbon dioxide equivalents. This step uses each gas’s 100-year global warming potential, which measures how much a given amount of the gas is estimated to contribute to global warming over a period of 100 years after being emitted. Carbon dioxide is assigned a global warming potential equal to 1. This analysis uses global warming potentials from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) Fifth Assessment Report. In that report, methane has a global warming potential of 28, which means a ton of methane emissions contributes 28 times as much warming as a ton of carbon dioxide emissions over 100 years, and that ton of methane emissions is therefore equal to 28 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. For additional perspective, this indicator also shows greenhouse gas emissions in relation to economic output and population. While this indicator includes the major greenhouse gases emitted by human activities, it does not include other greenhouse gases and substances that are not covered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement but that still affect the Earth’s energy balance and climate (see the indicator for more details). For example, this indicator excludes ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which have high global warming potentials, as these gases have been or are currently being phased out under an international agreement called the Montreal Protocol. This indicator also excludes black carbon and aerosols, which most greenhouse gas emissions inventories do not cover. While there are many natural greenhouse gas emissions sources, this indicator focuses on emissions that are associated with human activities—those that are most responsible for the observed buildup of these gases in our atmosphere. Although the land use, land-use change, and forestry emission estimates include emissions and sinks from unmanaged lands due to forest growth, fires, and other factors, this indicator does not include other natural sources such as methane emissions from unmanaged wetlands. Data for this indicator came from EPA’s . This report is available online at: . The calculations in Figure 3 are based on GDP and population data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census, respectively."

This indicator describes emissions of greenhouse gases worldwide. This figure shows worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and several fluorinated gases from 1990 to 2015. For consistency, emissions are expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. These totals include emissions and sinks due to land-use change and forestry. Data source: Climate Watch, 2023 This figure shows worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by sector from 1990 to 2015. For consistency, emissions are expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. These totals include emissions and sinks due to land-use change and forestry. Note that the sectors shown here are different from the economic sectors used in U.S. emissions accounting (see the indicator). Emissions from international transport (aviation and marine) are separate from the energy sector because they are not part of individual countries’ emissions inventories. The energy sector includes all other transportation activities. Data source: Climate Watch, 2023 This figure shows carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 to 2020 for different regions of the world. These totals do not include emissions or sinks related to land-use change or forestry. Inclusion of land-use change and forestry would increase the apparent emissions from some regions while decreasing the emissions from others. Data source: Climate Watch, 2023 Increasing emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activities worldwide, especially burning of fossil fuels, have led to a substantial increase in atmospheric concentrations of long-lived and other greenhouse gases (see the indicator). Every country around the world emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, meaning the root cause of climate change is truly global in scope. Some countries produce far more greenhouse gases than others, and several factors—such as economic activity (including the composition and efficiency of the economy), population, income level, land use, and climatic conditions—can influence a country’s emissions levels. Tracking greenhouse gas emissions worldwide provides a global context for understanding the United States’ and other nations’ roles in climate change. Like the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions indicator, this indicator focuses on emissions of gases covered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and several fluorinated gases. These are all important greenhouse gases that are influenced by human activities, and the Convention requires participating countries to develop and periodically submit an inventory of these emissions. Data and analysis for this indicator come from Climate Watch, which is managed by the World Resources Institute. Climate Watch compiles data from peer-reviewed and internationally recognized greenhouse gas inventories developed by EPA and other government agencies worldwide. Global estimates for carbon dioxide are published annually, but estimates for other gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, are available only every fifth year. Climate Watch includes estimates of emissions and sinks associated with land use and forestry activities, which come from global estimates compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Each greenhouse gas has a different lifetime (how long it stays in the atmosphere) and a different ability to trap heat in our atmosphere. To allow different gases to be compared and added together, emissions are converted into carbon dioxide equivalents. This step uses each gas’s 100-year global warming potential, which measures how much a given amount of the gas is estimated to contribute to global warming over a period of 100 years after being emitted. Carbon dioxide is assigned a global warming potential equal to 1. This analysis uses global warming potentials from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) Fourth Assessment Report. In that report, methane has a global warming potential of 25, which means a ton of methane emissions contributes 25 times as much warming as a ton of carbon dioxide emissions over 100 years, and that ton of methane emissions is therefore equal to 25 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. See for global warming potentials from IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report. Like the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions indicator, this indicator does not include emissions of gases that affect climate but are not covered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. For example, this indicator excludes ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which have high global warming potentials, because these gases have been or are currently being phased out under an international agreement called the Montreal Protocol. This indicator also excludes black carbon and aerosols, which most emissions inventories do not cover. There are also various emissions of greenhouse gases of natural origin, which this indicator does not cover. Global emissions inventories for gases other than carbon dioxide are limited to five-year intervals. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change database has more comprehensive data; however, these data are available mainly for a group of mostly developed countries that account for only about half of global greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, to provide a more representative measure of global greenhouse gas emissions, this indicator uses the broader Climate Watch database. Data for this indicator came from the World Resources Institute’s Climate Watch database, which is accessible online at: . The Climate Watch dataset consists of data that were originally collected by organizations including the International Energy Agency, EPA, the U.S. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Other global emissions estimates—such as the estimates published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change —are based on many of the same sources."

Greenhouse gases from human activities are the most significant driver of observed climate change since the mid-20th century. The indicators in this chapter characterize emissions of the major greenhouse gases resulting from human activities, the concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere, and how emissions and concentrations have changed over time. When comparing emissions of different gases, these indicators use a concept called “global warming potential” to convert amounts of other gases into carbon dioxide equivalents. As greenhouse gas emissions from human activities increase, they build up in the atmosphere and warm the climate, leading to many other changes around the world—in the atmosphere, on land, and in the oceans. The indicators in other chapters of this report illustrate many of these changes, which have both positive and negative effects on people, society, and the environment—including plants and animals. Because many of the major greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for tens to hundreds of years after being released, their warming effects on the climate persist over a long time and can therefore affect both present and future generations. See to learn more about the numbers in the table above and the versions EPA uses for various calculations. EPA has two key programs that provide data on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States: the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks and the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The programs are complementary, providing both a higher-level perspective on the nation’s total emissions and detailed information about the sources and types of emissions from individual facilities. The data in EPA’s U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions indicator come from the national inventory. EPA develops an annual report called the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (or the GHG Inventory). This report tracks trends in total annual U.S. emissions by source (or sink), economic sector, and greenhouse gas going back to 1990. EPA uses national energy data, data on national agricultural activities, and other national statistics to provide a comprehensive accounting of total greenhouse gas emissions for all man-made sources in the United States. This inventory fulfills the nation’s obligation to provide an annual emissions report under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. using interactive tools. Since 2010, EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has been collecting annual emissions data from industrial sources that directly emit large amounts of greenhouse gases. Generally, facilities that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year are required to report. The program also collects data from entities known as \"suppliers\" that supply certain fossil fuels and industrial gases that will emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere if burned or released—for example, refineries that supply petroleum products such as gasoline. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program only requires reporting; it is not an emissions control program.

Water quality trading (WQT) under the Clean Water Act (CWA) is an option for compliance with effluent limitations in a NPDES permit. Water quality trading can provide greater flexibility on the timing and level of technology a facility might install, reduce overall compliance costs, and encourage voluntary participation of non-point sources within the watershed. Trading can provide ancillary environmental benefits such as carbon sinks, flood retention, riparian improvement, and habitat. Pollutant sources in a watershed may face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Under trading programs, facilities with NPDES permitted discharges facing higher pollution control costs may be able to meet their regulatory obligations by purchasing environmentally equivalent (or superior) pollution reductions from another source at lower cost. Trading can produce substantial cost savings while meeting the same water quality goal. It may also offer greater flexibility on the timing and level of technology a facility might install. Trading can provide ancillary environmental benefits such as flood retention, riparian improvement, and habitat. A permitted facility or a point source might trade with another point source or with a nonpoint source. The partners might trade directly, or through a third party. Any party might act as champion for a trading program. Trading works best when all stakeholders interested in their local watershed including permit holders, conservation organizations and watershed groups are involved in the development of the trading program. A credit is a unit of pollutant reduction usually measured in pounds equivalent. Credits can be generated by a point source over-controlling its discharge or by a nonpoint source installing best management practices (BMPs) that are different than or in addition to its baseline. On February 6, 2019, EPA issued “ ” (2019 Memorandum). The 2019 Memorandum reiterates EPA’s strong support for water quality trading; promotes the adoption of market-based programs to incentivize the implementation of technologies and practices to reduce nonpoint source pollution; provides additional guidance and policy options to stakeholders for developing and implementing market-based programs; and promotes increased investment in conservation actions. To achieve these goals, the 2019 Memorandum identified six market-based principles: EPA's policy supports trading of nutrients (e.g., total phosphorus, total nitrogen), sediment load reductions, temperature, and other pollutants. EPA supports trading in unimpaired waters to maintain water quality standards as well as in impaired waters. EPA supports both pre-TMDL trading and trading under a TMDL. Trading scenarios include point source-point source trades, point source-nonpoint source trades, pretreatment trades, and intra-plant trades. EPA does not support trading that results in an impairment of an existing or designated use, adversely affect drinking water systems, or exceeds a cap established under a TMDL. Baselines are the limits or expectations that would apply absent trading. These operate as the basis for credit calculation. A buyer’s baseline would be the effluent limits in its NPDES permit, and in a trading scenario, it can purchase credits to achieve that limit. The baseline for a point source seller is its most stringent effluent limitation. A point source seller generates credits when it reduces its discharge below its baseline. On September 5, 2019, EPA requested public comments on options for providing additional flexibilities for baselines for nonpoint sources in watersheds with EPA established or approved Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). Trading might occur directly between two or more point sources or through an exchange. Trading might also occur between a point source and a nonpoint source, either directly or through an exchange. A credit exchange is where a third party such as a person, organization, or website, facilitates trading. Another unique feature a credit exchange might include is a reserve of credits held in case of failed trades. These are the basic trading scenarios; others may exist."

EPA is researching new and existing alternative water source practices as a way to meet the growing demand for sufficient quantities of high-quality water and to address water scarcity. These opportunities include limiting discharges from wastewater treatment; identifying alternative water sources; recovering water resources; developing methods to enhance the availability and quality of recycled water; and creating tools that aid decision-making for fit-for-purpose water reuse. EPA published the in 2012 as a general reference for water reuse practices, and the in 2017 to inform current practices in the rapidly developing area of direct potable reuse. EPA’s research aims to advance the scientific understanding of water reuse to improve the quantity of high-quality water without creating other significant environmental impacts. EPA research focuses on potable and non-potable fit-for-purpose water reuse for small, decentralized systems in multiple areas. These general research areas explore testing treatments on alternative water sources; creating operational water reuse practices; and developing tools to inform community decisions. One area to supplement water resources that requires more research is defining treatment requirements for the safe use of alternative waters for a variety of end uses based on fit-for-purpose risk characterization. In the context of this webpage, fit-for-purpose specifications are the treatment requirements needed to bring water from a particular source to the quality standard to ensure public health, environmental protection, or specific user needs. To prepare for broader implementation of water reuse practices nationwide, it is essential to identify chemicals of emerging concern and microbial contaminants during the assessment of alternative water sources. EPA research may produce information and tools to help communities adapt their water systems to a changing climate. This includes assessments to determine and minimize the impacts of the alternative source waters use in existing drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. The is a web-based tool for screening-level assessments of source water options for any urban building location across the United States that is considering onsite non-potable reuse. Access the tool to identify the most environmentally and cost-effective suite of source water options to meet non-potable needs. There are three general types of water reuse (excluding agricultural, environmental, and industrial applications): is water that is captured, treated, and used for non-drinking water purposes such as toilet flushing, washing clothing, or irrigation. is water that will be treated with an environmental buffer and used for drinking water. For example, stormwater or wastewater can be treated at a wastewater treatment plant, then directed to a lake, river, or groundwater aquifer. The water is then treated at a drinking water treatment plant and directed into the drinking water distribution system. is water that will be treated and used for drinking water without an environmental buffer. For example, stormwater or wastewater can be directed to a municipal wastewater treatment plant and/or an advanced wastewater treatment facility for treatment. Once treated, it is then directed to a drinking water treatment plant for further treatment or sent directly to a drinking water distribution system."

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a complex class of chemicals that historically have been used in industry and consumer products and continue to be widely used today. PFAS can be persistent in the environment and the human body. PFAS contamination of water is a significant issue in the United States and a high priority for the EPA. EPA research on PFAS in water sources focuses on developing tools for evaluating and managing risks from PFAS, such as the development of analytical methods for measuring occurrence; drinking water and wastewater treatment approaches for removal; residual stream treatment and management; and identifying and characterizing PFAS sources to design treatment management approaches. EPA has a range of research on PFAS that is not limited to water resources. For more information about all of EPA's PFAS research, please visit or . EPA’s research includes the development of analytical methods for measuring large groups of PFAS in water and water-related samples. Total organic fluorine and total oxidizable precursors are analytical methods that help researchers determine whether a PFAS might be present by looking at certain components and precursors of PFAS. Traditional targeted methods require researchers to know what chemicals they are looking for, which can be time consuming and labor intensive. Scientists are building on existing analytical methods and also developing used to analyze and characterize thousands of unknown and new PFAS. . Today, researchers can rapidly characterize thousands of never studied chemical compounds in a wide variety of environmental, residential, and biological media. This approach is called non-targeted analysis. . EPA’s research on drinking water treatment technologies for PFAS focuses on collecting existing treatment data from the literature and combining it with results from additional laboratory studies on PFAS removal. These studies use a wide variety of technologies, including granular activated carbon, ion exchange, and membranes. EPA researchers evaluate, model, and optimize treatment technologies, including treatment at the water treatment plant and at the point of use, such as a faucet. EPA’s research is conducted at multiple scales, including benchtop studies in the laboratory, pilot-scale studies both in the laboratory and in the field, and full-scale treatment studies at municipal drinking water treatment plants. EPA research focuses on a range of drinking water system sizes, such as drinking water systems serving large cities with populations of more than 10,000 people, to very small communities with populations of less than 100 people that may use point-of-use or point-of-entry systems. Research focuses on issues that impact systems with technical, financial, and managerial capability limitations. To help homeowners make an informed decision when trying to reduce PFAS in their drinking water, EPA researchers conducted studies on several off-the-shelf, commercially available technologies, including granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange treatment systems to determine if they were capable of reducing PFAS levels in drinking water. and how different filtration systems fared. Possible PFAS sources in water can include industrial and hospital wastewater, landfill leachate, or washing facilities. Knowing the sources of PFAS in water resources is critical for developing cost-effective approaches to managing PFAS contamination. EPA’s research focuses on building and improving models to predict the fate and transport of PFAS in water, assess exposure pathways and risks, and identify and characterize PFAS sources and concentrations. Researchers apply these models and analyses to reduce possible exposures to PFAS and improve treatment technologies. PFAS is difficult to treat in water and requires effective and economical solutions. This research focuses on the development and advancement of cost-effective, high-efficiency processes to remove PFAS from wastewater, stormwater, industrial and process wastes, leachates, biosolids, and residual streams. PFAS molecules are made up of a chain of linked carbon and fluorine atoms. Thanks to recent trials, EPA researchers may have found an effective method of breaking this chain link of carbon and fluorine to destroy PFAS—called Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO). ."

It’s designed for state, and territory, and tribal personnel responsible for drinking water regulations compliance and treatment technologies and others in the drinking water sector. To support the efforts government agencies with assisting small systems, EPA's Office of Research and Development and Office of Water, in partnership with the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA), has held an annual drinking water workshop for over 20 years to provide timely technical and regulatory information relevant to small systems. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, a system is considered small if it serves 10,000 or fewer people. When the first workshop was held in 2004, it was by invitation only and designed as an educational opportunity for state staff working with small communities to install arsenic treatment technologies. In 2008, at the encouragement of state agencies, the workshop was opened to the public and expanded to include small drinking water system distribution, water quality, source water, treatment, and operations topics. Beginning in 2024, the workshop is designed for EPA; ASDWA; and Tribal, state, and territory personnel responsible for drinking water regulations compliance and treatment technologies permitting (primacy agencies). Focusing on the most pressing challenges facing small systems, the workshops provide current information, resources, training, and networking opportunities needed to help in building systems capacity and sustainably and with providing equitable access to drinking water.

Explore available to assist with infrastructure needs and treatment for contaminants. In direct support of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) funding authorized by Congress through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, , EPA researchers at the Office of Research and Development (ORD) will be providing small and/or disadvantaged communities with drinking water technical assistance related to lead service lines identification and treatment for emerging contaminants. Technical assistance: Emerging contaminants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are challenging to drinking water systems across the country. Treatment for emerging contaminants is often not known, and when it is known, can be extremely costly. It is important to develop treatment options to ensure public health protection. EPA researchers are working with public, private, and Tribal owned water systems across the country through a BIL-funded technical assistance program. This program is available to help local water systems identify optimal treatment methods for removing emerging contaminants, including PFAS, and optimize the long-term operation of the chosen technology. It will also be used to develop best practice guides and performance/cost estimate tools so water utilities across the nation can make informed treatment and operational choices. Technical assistance connects these water systems with EPA experts directly. It is estimated that there are approximately 6 to 10 million homes with lead service lines in the United States. Service lines are pipes that connect a home or building to the drinking water main. When these pipes are made from lead, they are referred to as lead service lines. The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) prohibited the installation of lead service lines, but there are still many homes and businesses with lead service lines installed prior to 1986. Knowing where a community may have lead service lines is critical to develop a replacement program. EPA researchers will be working with multiple communities across the U.S. to conduct research on the best approaches to lead service line identification (LSLID). The results of this research will be used to develop best practices and tools that drinking water systems can use to minimize cost and improve their ability to identify and remove lead service lines more easily. .

Explore available to assist with source water protection. Sources of public drinking water come from can come from groundwater and surface waters, including aquifers, springs, streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Protecting source water can reduce risks by preventing exposures to contaminated water. EPA researchers are exploring interventions to prevent and mitigate source water pollutants, including those associated with harmful algal blooms wildfire, and pathogens. EPA is also focusing on developing tools and resources for communities to support their decision making regarding alternative sources of water, such as water reuse. Make faster decisions related to cyanobacterial algal blooms with the , which provides satellite data for over 2,000 lakes and reservoirs across the United States. Algal toxins from harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasingly contaminating sources waters, as well as the drinking water treatment facilities that the waters supply. Algal toxins, including cyanotoxins, can enter drinking water supplies as a result of the growth of HABs in surface water sources or groundwater sources under the direct influence of surface water. The management of HABs is first dependent on the ability to identify source waters and associated drinking water treatment systems that are vulnerable to blooms. Then, interventions need to be applied at points from the source water to water distribution. EPA researchers are investigating the efficacy of different interventions to mitigate HAB development in source waters and algal toxin-related risk from impacted source waters. Wildfire can impact drinking source water through increased sedimentation and mobilization of nutrients, heavy metals, and other pollutants. These effects may require that drinking water utilities adapt their treatment processes to account for these changes, which may, in turn, result in elevated concentrations of contaminants, including nitrate and disinfection byproducts (DBPs) post-treatment. Modeling and decision support tools can help explore treatability and adaptation strategies for these impacted systems. Research is critical to better understand how fires affect water quality, drinking water sources, and the overall health of an ecosystem. EPA researchers and EPA grantee award recipients are investigating the impacts of wildfire to source water quality and water infrastructure. Meeting the demand for clean and adequate supplies of water, especially in regions undergoing hotter and drier climate conditions, requires addressing research gaps associated with water reuse and water storage, including enhanced aquifer recharge.

Explore available to assist with infrastructure needs, including modeling distribution systems, contaminants treatment, security, and more. EPA is developing resources and tools toward a systems approach for maintaining drinking water infrastructure performance and integrity and increasing infrastructure resilience. This includes developing approaches to protect human health, minimizing the current and long-term costs of supplying water to all customers, and assessing vulnerability to, preparedness for, and response and recovery from extreme weather and other disasters. Research techniques utilize modeling, data analytics, and management tools, as well as analytical, geospatial, and commercially available sensor data to assess system conditions, hydraulics, water quality, and resilience from source water to the consumer’s tap. Drinking water distribution systems are large, complex, and unique ecosystems. Proper management is critical to delivering safe water and maintaining the public health of a community. In storage tanks and on pipe walls, contaminants can accumulate, biofilm can multiply, iron materials can corrode, and other infrastructure components can weaken, deteriorate, and form leaks. Contaminants can also propagate and accumulate in premise plumbing systems within homes and buildings. All of these make it harder to maintain disinfectant residuals and water quality from the treatment plant to the tap. EPA research is addressing multiple approaches to maintaining water quality and building the resilience and reliability of distribution systems, including monitoring, modeling, booster disinfection, optimization of tank operations, and replacing/repairing infrastructure. Much of the focus is on developing and evaluating approaches that are affordable and practical for small and/or vulnerable communities. Distribution system corrosion occurs when the pipes that carry treated drinking water are gradually worn away by a chemical reaction between water and the metal surface (pipe wall or solder). A number of factors can be involved in the extent to which metal pipes corrode, including the chemistry of the water (acidity and alkalinity), and the types and amounts of minerals in the water, temperature of the water, the amount of wear in the pipes and how long the water stays in pipes, and the presence of protective scales or coatings inside the pipes. This corrosion can result in metal release, such as lead and copper, into the water if pipes are not protected. It can also cause reaction with disinfectants used to treat for microbial contaminants, which can result in disinfection byproducts and increased pathogen growth. Effective corrosion control can reduce these concerns and also decreases the risk of costly infrastructure repairs or replacement. EPA researchers are expanding scientific understanding of corrosion concerns and developing resources and tools to assist water systems. Corrosion and solubility play major roles in controlling the release of lead and copper from lead service lines and other plumbing materials into drinking water. Key water quality parameters, such as pH, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon, disinfectants, and corrosion inhibitors, interact with lead and copper materials in complex ways that can result in corrosion and release into drinking water sources. Lead that is released into drinking water supplies can pose serious risks to public health, especially to children. The release of copper from distribution materials can lead to excessive localized or pitting corrosion, which is typically not associated with elevated copper levels or regulatory considerations but can be a major financial burden as well as an inconvenience to homeowners. Corroding metals and associated corrosion products in finished water can react with disinfectants, causing areas of low disinfectant residual in the distribution system. Low disinfectant residual can increase the potential for microbial growth, including the growth of opportunistic pathogens. Effective corrosion control treatment and distribution system maintenance can allow for better control of microbial growth. EPA researchers are expanding scientific understanding of corrosion concerns and developing resources and tools for characterizing and mitigating lead and copper in drinking water distribution systems and premise plumbing.

Disasters, whether human-made or naturally occurring, can impact the ability of drinking water utilities to function, including the potential disruption of drinking water supplies to municipalities. Water systems, including water treatment and distribution systems, are a critical infrastructure system and require increased protection and the ability for utilities to detect, respond to, and recover from physical and cyber threats and attacks. Water system managers need to know when their treatment systems, pumps, valves, tanks, etc. are being compromised, how to stop an attack, and how to recover so that safe and full service can be returned to the community. EPA researchers are conducting studies and developing modeling tools and technologies that aid the design and operation of drinking water systems in a way that decreases their vulnerability to disasters. This research is contributing to a resilient water sector, with tools and methodologies to respond to drinking water and source water contamination incidents and minimize the time that these systems are offline. Water systems, including water treatment and distribution systems, are considered one of the nation’s critical infrastructures. Critical infrastructure requires increased protection and the ability for utilities to detect, respond to, and recover from physical and cyber threats and attacks. Water system managers need to know when their treatment systems, pumps, valves, tanks, etc. are being compromised, how to stop an attack, and how to recover so that safe and full service can be returned to the community. Resilient water infrastructure systems can facilitate quick and effective decision making during emergency situations, including cyberattacks, to ensure access to adequate water capacity and quality. In partnership with the Department of Homeland Security, water utilities, and private sector, EPA researchers will be demonstrating and documenting the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities on internet-facing operating technology process control systems. This work can inform and evaluate utility response or mitigation actions that could counter or prevent the impacts of a cyberattack. Ultimately, the impact of this work will be a water sector with the tools and methodologies needed to prevent or mitigate high impact cyberattacks on both physical and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure. EPA also led a steering committee of water industry experts to develop the capability to evaluate and test cybersecurity equipment for the protection of water system infrastructure. Research to improve the cyber security of water utilities is carried out at the EPA located at the Department of Energy Idaho National Laboratory. Watch the recording of the (August 29, 2023). This webinar includes information on tools and resources to help small systems build cyber resilience and provides an overview of EPA's water distribution system operational technology cybersecurity research at the Water Security Test Bed. EPA research furthers the understanding of contaminants’ movement and persistence in drinking water systems to inform decision making regarding detection, decontamination, waste management, and operational countermeasures. Most drinking water utilities use commercially available water quality sensors to monitor for changes in water quality indicators. These indicators may include pH, levels of free or total chlorine, and total organic carbon. EPA has tested commonly used sensors to learn if they can detect water contaminated with these chemical, biological, or radiological agents, in addition to detecting routine water quality variations. Research focuses on novel detection technologies that are new to the market, and technologies that could detect contamination in source water, such as reservoirs. Intentional or unintentional contamination of a drinking water distribution system can affect human health and result in high costs to return the water system to service. Many contaminants, whether they are chemical, biological, or radiological, can adhere to or become embedded in rusty or corroded pipes or in biologically active layers (biofilm) on the pipe walls. EPA researchers examine techniques to clean, or decontaminate, contaminated water infrastructure including, pipes, valves and tanks. Following an emergency event, communities need access to clean water not only for drinking but also for cooking, cleaning, and medical triage. EPA is researching decision support tools to help decision makers balance the many factors that go into the design and implementation of a treatment system at their site. Learn more about ."

Explore available that support treatment technologies approaches for contaminant removal. Treating drinking water prior to distribution is critical for the protection of public health. EPA research is advancing innovative and sustainable technologies and processes for addressing immediate and emerging chemical and biological contaminants of concern, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), lead, algal toxins, disinfection byproducts, and opportunistic pathogens. This research is also advancing the development and evaluation of effective and low-cost treatment technologies for small systems and overburdened communities. Chemical contaminants (inorganic and organic) in drinking water are elements or compounds that may be naturally occurring, such as metals and algal toxins, or human made, such as PFAS and pharmaceuticals. EPA’s drinking water research is addressing a wide range of chemical contaminants of emerging concern. | | | | | Lead and copper enter drinking water primarily through plumbing materials that contain them, especially where the water has high acidity or low mineral content that corrodes pipes and fixtures. The most common sources of lead in drinking water are lead pipes, faucets, and fixtures. In homes with lead pipes that connect the home to the water main, also known as lead services lines, these pipes are typically the most significant source of lead in the water. Lead pipes are more likely to be found in older cities and homes built before 1986. Among homes without lead service lines, the most common problem is with leaded brass components in chrome-plated faucets and plumbing with lead solder. EPA’s lead and copper research focuses on source identification and relative source contributions, lead service line identification, sampling approaches, and will improve models for estimating lead exposure and mobility. Researchers are addressing corrosion control issues in distribution systems, including premise plumbing, and the physical and chemical attributes of distribution system water that may lead to the release of lead and copper. allows users to generate a plumbing map to help pinpoint sources of lead. Visit our for additional research highlights.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( ) contamination of water is a significant issue in the United States and a high priority for the Agency. PFAS are a complex class of chemicals, some of which are persistent in the environment and human body. EPA’s research in the Office of Research and Development includes scientific support of regulatory and rulemaking efforts regarding PFAS in drinking water. (June 27, 2023) Learn about how EPA researchers are providing communities, including small and/or disadvantaged, with technical assistance in support of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) to assist with cost-effective treatment options for emerging contaminants, including PFAS. Algal toxins from harmful (HABs)are a growing risk for source water contamination, as well as the drinking water treatment facilities that the source waters supply. These treatment facilities face a difficult task of not only removing the toxins, but doing so in a safe and cost-effective way. EPA's researchers are helping communities by providing the science needed to confront this challenge. EPA is investigating innovative methods for nitrate reduction, including bench-scale experiments on the reduction of nitrate by sulfur, a process that can reduce the need for chemical handling among small drinking water systems. Researchers are also investigating an anaerobic biological denitrification pilot system. Initial research demonstrates that these innovative methods achieve good nitrate removal and have important operational benefits as compared to existing drinking water denitrification systems, such as less frequent backwashing and reduced chemical costs, and show promise for small community applications. EPA researchers are investigating biological treatment of drinking water for manganese, ammonia, arsenic, and iron. Researchers are conducting a pilot-scale biological treatment study for manganese removal, a pilot-scale biological treatment study for ammonia removal, and studying the biological treatment of arsenic. One of the major potential advantages of biological treatment processes is the minimal need for chemical handling and processes oversight. These advantages in turn make the process potentially advantageous for use in small drinking water treatment systems. EPA researchers are also investigating arsenic accumulation and its release from old cast iron water mains into water distribution systems, leading to arsenic levels above allowable limits and threats to consumer health. Research includes surveys of arsenic drinking water throughout the United States and testing the addition of orthophosphate to drinking water as a method to reduce arsenic release. Balancing residual disinfectant levels in distribution systems remains a challenge to control pathogens without forming unacceptable levels of harmful byproducts from the disinfectants. EPA researchers are studying effective control of (DBPs) in distribution and premise plumbing systems, while still effectively reducing opportunistic pathogens, such as . Through the use of bench-scale and computer-simulated approaches, EPA scientists and engineers are evaluating effective disinfectant concentrations to treat these pathogens while minimizing DBPs. Additionally, researchers are studying the relationships between health risks associated with DBPs, residuals, pathogen occurrence, and corrosion control of distribution systems and premise plumbing. Also see on this page. In drinking water, microbial contaminants (also referred to as biological contaminants) are microorganisms that act as . Opportunistic pathogens, like , continue to be one of the leading causes of drinking water related disease outbreaks. Other pathogens, including a wide variety of bacteria, protozoans, and viruses, also pose significant human health risks. Current treatments of pathogens include the use of disinfectants, such as chlorine and monochloramine, ultraviolet treatment, and filtration. To control and minimize the presence of these organisms, sufficient disinfectant residuals need to be maintained in the drinking water distribution system. In addition, systems need to balance the management of pathogens while minimizing the risk posed by the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Small- to medium-sized drinking water systems may have limited resources and expertise to evaluate and install innovative technologies. EPA research aims to help these utilities optimize disinfection practices and manage water quality throughout the drinking water system to reduce opportunistic and other pathogens. Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are chemicals that have not previously been detected in water or are being detected at significantly different levels than expected. These include a wide array of potential pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), surfactants, microorganisms, microplastics, and endocrine disrupting chemicals, among others. Factors such as shrinking water and financial resources, climate change, agricultural runoff, harmful algal blooms (HABs), and industrial land use can increase the probability of CECs found in drinking water. This issue is likely to disproportionately affect small drinking water systems due to limited resources and treatment options, among other factors. These unregulated contaminants can also occur in wastewater, reused water, or other sources and a comprehensive understanding of the risk posed by these potential pollutants is needed. CECs can be difficult to measure and can be linked to many current or historic sources. EPA’s research investigates analytical methods, occurrence, health effects, and treatment assessments to aid decision making to ensure that these CECs are at safe levels in drinking water, wastewater, and reused water. There are over 145,000 active public drinking water systems in the United States. Of these, 95% are considered small systems under the Safe Drinking Water Act, meaning they serve 10,000 or fewer people. While many of these active small systems consistently provide safe, reliable drinking water to their customers, many face a number of challenges in their ability to achieve and maintain system sustainability. Some of these small system challenges include lack of expertise to choose, operate, and maintain systems; lack of financial resources; aging infrastructure and limited options for residual disposal. EPA researchers are developing tools, technologies, and approaches to help small systems lower costs and provide safe drinking water now and in the future. There is the possibility that some drinking water systems may be affected by natural disasters, security incidents, or high levels of contaminants in the source where the drinking water comes from. On-site water treatment systems for contaminant incident responses need to be compatible with potentially enormous volumes of contaminated water. Evaluation of mobile, on-site emergency water treatment systems involves consideration of transportation issues, deployment, operation, cost and effectiveness for treating a wide variety of contaminants and concentrations. EPA is researching decision support tools to help decision makers balance the many factors that go into the design and implementation of a treatment system at their site. Part of this process could be containing the contaminated water locally so that it can be treated without the potential of releasing the contaminated water to the environment. Because these potential water volumes involved can be technically challenging, EPA is researching innovative approaches that would use locally available equipment and assets. Following an emergency event, communities need access to clean drinking water. EPA researchers partnered with a nonprofit to develop a modular, mobile water treatment system known as Water on Wheels–Emergency Mobile Water Treatment System (WOW Cart). The WOW Cart is an inexpensive and versatile water treatment system configured with multiple treatment technologies and equipped with alternative power sources. It's easy to operate and can be deployed to critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, ahead of oncoming natural events."

EPA research is addressing the need to characterize the responses of aquatic resources to the cumulative impacts of multiple, interacting stressors across space and time. Scientists are developing indicators, techniques, and methods to assess stressor-response relationships and impacts of multiple stressors, including climate change impacts. This is being done across a range of aquatic resources, including streams, wetlands, coral reefs, submerged aquatic vegetation, and estuaries. Studies on the development and improvements of biological assessment and monitoring tools, data, and applications continue and include case studies at local levels. Results of this research will empower communities to make informed decisions on restoration and conservation priorities and promote equitable distribution of the resulting benefits. Related research: Federal, state, Tribal, and local management actions to improve water quality can lead to a broad range of benefits for communities. EPA’s research is increasing the understanding of benefits associated with different waterbody types and our ability to evaluate climate change, environmental justice, and equity issues within a water quality benefits framework.

Biofuels are derived from renewable biological materials such as ethanol from corn starch, corn stover, perennial grasses, woody biomass, and algae, and diesel from soybeans. Currently available biofuels are made from sugar crops (sugarcane, sugarbeet); starch crops (corn, potatoes); oilseed crops (soybean, sunflower, rapeseed); and animal fats. Sugar and starch crops are converted through a fermentation process to form bioalcohols, including ethanol (the most widely used), butanol, and propanol. Oils and animal fats can be processed into biodiesel. Most vehicles built after 2000 can use gasoline-ethanol blends containing up to 15% ethanol (by volume). Currently there are about 3,500 fueling stations in the U.S. that offer E-85 fuel, most of which are in the upper Midwest. Replacing fossil fuels with biofuels has the potential to reduce some undesirable environmental impacts of fossil fuel production and use, including conventional and greenhouse gas (GHG) pollutant emissions, exhaustible resource depletion, and dependence on unstable foreign suppliers. Demand for biofuels could also increase farm income. Biofuel production and use has drawbacks as well, including land and water resource requirements, air and ground water pollution. Depending on the feedstock and production process, biofuels can emit even more GHGs than some fossil fuels on an energy -equivalent basis. In 2007, Congress enacted the with the stated goals of “mov[ing] the United states toward greater energy independence and security [and] to increase the production of clean renewable fuels.” In accordance with these goals, EISA revised the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program, which was created under the 2005 Energy Policy Act and is administered by EPA, to increase the volume of renewable fuel required to be blended into transportation fuel to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022. Section 204 of EISA directs EPA, in consultation with the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Energy, to assess and report triennially to Congress on the environmental and resource conservation impacts of the RFS Program. The reports: The first report to Congress was completed in 2011 and provided an assessment of the environmental and resource conservation impacts associated with increased biofuel production and use (EPA/600/R-10/183F). The overarching conclusions of this first report were: (1) the environmental impacts of increased biofuel production and use were likely negative but limited in impact; (2) there was a potential for both positive and negative impacts in the future; and (3) EISA goals for biofuels production could be achieved with minimal environmental impacts if best practices were used and if technologies advanced to facilitate the use of second-generation biofuel feedstocks (corn stover, perennial grasses, woody biomass, algae, and waste). The second report to Congress was completed in 2018 and reaffirmed the overarching conclusions of the 2011 Report (EPA/600/R-18/195). The 2018 Report noted that the biofuel production and use conditions that led to the conclusions of the 2011 Report had not materially changed, and that the production of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks anticipated by both the EISA and the 2011 Report had not materialized. Noting observed increases in acreage for corn and soybean production in the period prior to and following implementation of the RFS2 Program, the 2018 Report concluded that the environmental and resource conservation impacts associated with land use change were likely due, at least in part, to the RFS and associated production of biofuel feedstocks. EPA, in consultation with USDA and DOE, is currently developing the third report to Congress, which will build on the conclusions of the previous two reports. Opportunities for public engagement will be announced in Federal Register Notices."

Native American and Tribal populations bear an excessive burden of poor indoor air quality (IAQ) and asthma. The rate of asthma in the Native American and Tribal populations is almost double the national average. Scientific research has found a link between poor IAQ, asthma, and other adverse health effects. It is important to increase awareness among Native American and Tribal populations of the health results of poor IAQ and how to improve IAQ in their homes and communities. The plan is to invite indoor air quality (IAQ) champions working with Tribal communities to share innovative approaches, network with others across the nation, and learn about IAQ information and Tribal-specific materials. The goal is to reduce the percentage of Native American and Tribal populations exposed to indoor environmental pollutants. A recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that asthma affects almost 12 percent of people living in Tribal communities—nearly double the current national average of 7 percent. Managing triggers is especially important for Tribal communities who are disproportionately affected by asthma. Secondhand smoke is a mixture of the smoke given off by the burning end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and the smoke exhaled by smokers. Secondhand smoke is also called environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and exposure to secondhand smoke is sometimes called involuntary or passive smoking. Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of chemicals known to be toxic (poisonous) or carcinogenic (cancer-causing). Although secondhand smoke itself vanishes from sight after a brief period of time, it actually lingers in the air hours after the tobacco has been extinguished. Further, the chemicals in secondhand smoke are absorbed into clothing fabric, drapes, furniture upholstery, and carpeting — leaving dangerous chemicals in the environment long after the smoke vanishes from sight. Traditional and/or ritual use of tobacco is an important cultural component in many Native American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. For many, tobacco is sacred. It is burned for peace or prayer. Smoking traditional tobacco and manufactured tobacco both may result in health problems — heart attack, stroke and lung disease — in the smoker and his or her children, however, manufactured tobacco is generally treated with more chemicals and thus may be more toxic as a result. Nicotine, the addictive component of cigarettes, is found in both traditional and manufactured tobacco. Traditional and ritual tobacco use is different from the habitual abuse developed by addicted smokers. EPA’s Smoke Free Homes and Cars Program aims to reduce children’s exposure to secondhand smoke by asking parents and other caregivers to take a pledge not to smoke inside the home or car. The website has easy to understand information about the health effects of secondhand smoke and materials that can be ordered or downloaded at no cost, including a brochure “Secondhand Tobacco Smoke and the Health of Your Family” is also readily available on the website. Learn about Radon and download Radon materials on Peter Diethrich, GAP Manager of Environmental Programs of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe. As the leading cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers, radon has become a serious issue for many Tribal communities, including the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of Colorado. Peter Diethrich is the tribe's General Assistance Program — GAP — Manager of Environmental Programs; the goal of the GAP is to assist tribes in developing the capacity to plan and establish environmental protection programs and to develop and implement solid and hazardous waste programs in accordance with their individual needs. Once the Southern Ute Tribe developed an efficient solid waste program, Peter was directed by his EPA grant manager to alter the program to include IAQ with an emphasis on radon. Peter has taken on radon and faced several challenges in terms of testing — mainly due to location. Situated in the Southwest region of Colorado, many Southern Ute families live in remote areas. Use of short-term carbon tests for radon proved to be difficult due to the time-frame necessary to ship to the lab — typically two to three days. Because of the time and distance, many of the test kits would return with invalid results. To mediate this challenge, Peter purchased two continuous radon monitoring devices through GAP funding. These tests generate results on the spot. Once Peter visits a Tribal home, he can use this tool to measure the concentration of radon in the home by the hour. But Peter's job isn't done after he leaves the homes he tests. By posting advertisements in newspapers and e-newsletters, Peter is able to promote radon testing in the tribe. This strategy was especially useful during National Radon Action Month — NRAM — in January. During NRAM, Peter placed ads in the Tribal Housing and Bureau of Indian Affairs newsletters, which prompted an increase in testing. Another effective method is through word of mouth — Tribal members have encouraged their friends and family to test their homes once they understand the importance and ease of testing. This form of outreach has been a great way to increase and spread awareness on the health risk associated with radon. To learn more about Peter's work, contact at pdieth@southern-utee.nsn.us. For basic information about mold growth in homes and its potential health effects, visit . Smoke is made up of a complex mixture of gases and fine, microscopic particles produced when wood and other organic matter burn. The biggest health threat from wood smoke comes from fine particles (also called particulate matter). They are small enough to enter the lungs where they can cause bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma, or other serious respiratory diseases. Fine particles can also aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases, and are linked to premature deaths in people with these chronic conditions. Many old, pot-bellied wood stoves are still functioning to provide warmth and a cooking fire in Tribal communities; but they may also be releasing wood smoke that is harmful to the health of everyone exposed to it, especially the young and the old. To avoid these inevitable health risks — and gain the greater efficiency and effectiveness of new, cleaner burning technology wood stoves — it is recommended that old stoves be gradually replaced or “changed out.” Changing out wood stoves requires a financial investment; however, there are programs that provide financial assistance and manufacturers that provide discounts. The results of replacement speak for themselves with improvements in the health of children and community, home safety, visibility, and indoor air quality. EPA certified wood stoves burn more efficiently and cleanly."

In 1977, Congress amended the (CAA or Act) to provide for a (PSD) program. The PSD program protects air quality by requiring all major new and modified sources located in areas whose air quality has been designated under CAA Section 107 as either being in attainment of the or as unclassifiable to undergo a preconstruction review for each air pollutant regulated under the PSD program that the new major stationary source or major modification will emit or increase in significant amounts. Areas that are in attainment of the NAAQS are categorized as either “Class I”, “Class II,” or “Class III” which determines the increment of air quality deterioration allowed. Under the PSD program, all international parks, national wilderness areas and national memorial parks that exceed 5,000 acres, and of national parks that exceed 6,000 acres are designated as mandatory federal Class I areas in order to preserve, protect and enhance air quality. All other areas that attain the NAAQS are initially designated as Class II. Section 164 of the CAA, gives states and tribes the ability to request redesignation from Class II to Class I called “non-federal” Class I areas. Redesignation is one of the tools available to tribes (and states) under the CAA to afford special protection to air quality. In August 2013, we released guidance for federally recognized Indian tribes who are considering redesignating the areas within the exterior boundaries of their reservations as Class I areas under the PSD program. This guidance also provides answers to frequently asked questions and an explanation of the redesignation process."

        "content": "NASA Science Editorial Team As any urban dweller who has lived through a heat wave knows, a shady tree can make all the difference. But what happens when there’s no shade available? A recent in used NASA satellite data to identify a major gap in global resilience to climate change: cities in the Global South have far less green space — and therefore less cooling capacity — than cities in the Global North. The terms Global North and Global South were used in the study to distinguish developed countries (mostly in the Northern Hemisphere) from developing nations (mostly in the Southern Hemisphere). Cities tend to be hotter than nearby rural areas because of the urban heat island effect. Heat-trapping dark surfaces such as sidewalks, buildings, and roads absorb heat from the Sun’s rays, which raises the temperature of the city. Extreme heat poses serious health threats for urban residents, including dehydration, heat stroke, and even death. Though not a cure-all, greenery provides shade and releases moisture into the air, cooling the surroundings. “Cities can strategically prioritize developing new green spaces in areas that have less green space,” said , a climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York who was not affiliated with this study. “Satellite data can be really helpful for this.” An international team of researchers led by Yuxiang Li, a doctoral student at Nanjing University, analyzed the 500 largest cities in the world to compare their cooling capacities. They used data from the , jointly managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, to determine how effective green space was at cooling each city. First, they calculated the average land surface temperature for the hottest month of 2018 for each city, as well as the average of the hottest months from 2017 to 2019. Next, the researchers used a metric called the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to map how much green space each city had. The NDVI relies on the fact that healthy vegetation absorbs red light and reflects infrared light: the ratio of these wavelengths can show the density of healthy vegetation in a given satellite image. Researchers found that cities in the Global South have just 70% of the greenery-related cooling capacity of cities in the Global North. The green spaces in an average Global South city cool the temperature by about 4.5 F (2.5 C). In an average Global North city, that cooling capacity is 6.5 F (3.6 C). This compounds an existing problem: cities in the South tend to be at lower latitudes (that is, nearer to the Equator), which are predicted to see more heat extremes in the coming years. “It’s already clear that Global South countries will be impacted by heat waves, rising temperatures, and climatic extremes more than their Global North counterparts,” said Chi Xu, a professor of ecology at Nanjing University and a co-author of the study. The Global South has less capacity to adapt to heat because air conditioning is less common and power outages are more frequent. Why do cities in the Global South struggle to stay cool? Cities in the Global South tend to have less green space than cities in the Global North. This mirrors studies of the disparities within cities, sometimes referred to as the “luxury effect”: wealthier neighborhoods tend to have more green space than poorer neighborhoods. \"Wealthier cities also have more urban green spaces than the poorest cities,” Chi said. It’s unlikely that urban planners can close the gap between the study’s worst-performing city (Mogadishu, Somalia) and the best-performing one (Charlotte, North Carolina). Mogadishu is a dense city with a dry climate that limits vegetation growth. Still, there’s a lot that each city can learn from its neighbors. Within a given region, the researchers identified the city with the greatest cooling capacity and used that as a goal. They calculated the difference between the best-performing city in the region and every city nearby to get the potential additional cooling capacity. They found that cities’ average cooling capacity could be increased substantially — to as much as 18 F (10 C) — by systematically increasing green space quantity and quality. “How you utilize green space is really going to vary depending on the climate and the urban environment you’re focused on,” said Braneon, whose research at NASA focuses on climate change and urban planning. Greener cities in the U.S. and Canada have lower population densities. However, fewer people per square mile isn’t necessarily good for the environment: residents in low-density cities rely more on cars, and their houses tend to be bigger and less efficient. Braneon noted that there’s a suite of solutions beyond just planting trees or designating parks: Cities can increase cooling capacity by creating water bodies, seeding green roofs, and painting roofs or pavement lighter colors to reflect more light. With a global study like this, urban planners can compare strategies for cities within the same region or with similar densities. “For newly urbanized areas that aren’t completely built out, there’s a lot of room to still change the design,” Braneon said. NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery."

        "content": "Climate change is one of the most complex issues facing us today. It involves many dimensions – science, economics, society, politics, and moral and ethical questions – and is a global problem, felt on local scales, that will be around for thousands of years. Carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping greenhouse gas that is the primary driver of recent global warming, lingers in the atmosphere for many thousands of years, and the planet (especially the ocean) takes a while to respond to warming. So even if we stopped emitting all greenhouse gases today, global warming and climate change will continue to affect future generations. In this way, humanity is “committed” to some level of climate change. How much climate change? That will be determined by how our emissions continue and exactly how our climate responds to those emissions. Despite increasing awareness of climate change, our emissions of greenhouse gases continue on . In 2013, the daily level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . The last time levels were that high was about three to five million years ago, during the Pliocene Epoch. Because we are already committed to some level of climate change, responding to climate change involves a two-pronged approach: , either by reducing (for example, the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, or transport) or enhancing the (such as the oceans, forests, and soil). is to avoid significant , “stabilize greenhouse gas levels in a timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, ensure that food production is not threatened, and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner” (from the from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, page 4). The goal is to reduce our risks from the harmful effects of climate change (like sea-level rise, more intense extreme weather events, or food insecurity). It also includes making the most of any potential beneficial opportunities associated with climate change (for example, longer growing seasons or increased yields in some regions). Throughout history, people and societies have adjusted to and coped with changes in climate and extremes with varying degrees of success. Climate change (drought in particular) has been at least partly responsible for . Earth’s climate has been relatively stable for the past 10,000 years, and this stability has allowed for the development of our modern civilization and agriculture. Our modern life is tailored to that stable climate and not the much warmer climate of the next thousand-plus years. As our climate changes, we will need to adapt. The faster the climate changes, the more difficult it will be. While climate change is a global issue, it is felt on a local scale. Local governments are therefore at the frontline of adaptation. Cities and local communities around the world have been focusing on . They are working to build flood defenses, plan for heat waves and higher temperatures, install better-draining pavements to deal with floods and stormwater, and improve water storage and use. According to the 2014 report on (page 8) from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, governments at various levels are also getting better at adaptation. Climate change is being included into development plans: how to manage the increasingly extreme disasters we are seeing, how to protect coastlines and deal with sea-level rise, how to best manage land and forests, how to deal with and plan for drought, how to develop new crop varieties, and how to protect energy and public infrastructure.

        "content": "4 min read NASA Science Editorial Team Coral reefs, nicknamed the rainforests of the sea, are colorful, majestic underwater worlds teeming with life. However, their future is in jeopardy due to climate change, water pollution, and other human activities. Let’s explore why corals are important to us, how they are changing, and NASA’s role in monitoring their health. Coral reefs are one of the most important ecosystems on the planet. While they cover less than 1% of the ocean floor, healthy coral reefs provide homes to approximately a quarter of all known marine species. Currently, scientists have identified of reef-building corals around the world. Coral reefs also help protect human life and property. First, they act as a natural barrier for coastlines by dampening rough waves during storms. Second, they are . And third, they generate billions of dollars for local economies through ecotourism and fisheries, while also serving as a critical food source in many island nations. However, coral reefs are disappearing worldwide. We know this through extensive surveys conducted every decade. “Since 2009, the United Nations-supported found that , and things are speeding up,” stated Dr. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, professor of marine studies at the University of Queensland in Australia. A in 2018 from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that coral reefs would decline by 70-90% if average global air temperatures warm by 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial values. That number jumps to a 99% decline at 2°C (3.6°F) of warming. With the planet already warming due to human activities since the end of the 19 century, these declines in corals could be reached by 2050 or sooner. It’s not feasible for scientists to monitor the state of every coral reef each year. While divers can provide detailed information about the health of individual corals, the work is labor- and time-intensive, often taking weeks to survey one reef. That’s where airborne and satellite data from NASA and other agencies play a vital role. According to Juan Torres-Pérez, research scientist with NASA’s Ames Research Center and a representative on the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force (USCRTF), several NASA satellites have proven very useful in monitoring sea surface temperature and water quality changes over time, both of which are associated with changes in coral reef health. “NASA’s publicly available data provides scientists with valuable information to identify these changes as they happen,” he said. “To study a global problem, like the decline of coral reefs, you have to have a global perspective,” added Ved Chirayath, professor of Earth sciences at the University of Miami. Using NASA satellites and other remote sensing instruments, scientists can monitor coral reefs and their surroundings more frequently and more widely to help determine if they are changing. “Some challenging places to survey in the water are some of the most important to measure,\" he added, \"as that’s where the changes are happening.” One region that has been particularly challenging to measure from above is the tropics. According to Liane Guild, a scientist with NASA Ames and the USCRTF, prevalent cloud cover in the tropics can hinder the measurement of tropical regions from aircraft and satellites. “Innovative field tools, like using drones with cameras, can help acquire images below clouds, if present,” she said. “They can also collect fine-detailed images locally on corals to help understand coral health condition and decline.” Once the causes of coral reef changes can be measured, tracked, and predicted, scientists can take action to protect them. So how does climate change lead to a global decline in coral reefs, and is there hope for their future? Check out to find out.

        "content": "6 min read NASA Science Editorial Team The year 2021 has seen a flurry of extreme events around the globe. Among the many that have captured headlines so far this year: From the unique vantage point of space, we’ve been able to observe and monitor these events, no matter where they’ve occurred. Satellite data from NASA and other institutions are critical to understanding how and why extreme events take place. This year’s events come on the heels of a record-breaking 2020 in the United States. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there were 22 separate weather and climate-related disasters last year where the overall damages/costs for each reached or exceeded $1 billion. Last year also saw a record number of tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Basin. There’s growing evidence that people and the planet are increasingly impacted by extreme events. According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, published in 2018 by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, “more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events, as well as changes in average climate conditions, are expected to continue to damage infrastructure, ecosystems, and social systems that provide essential benefits to communities.” As the impacts of extreme events continue to mount, interest has grown in the scientific community to study whether specific extreme events can be partially attributed to human activities. With the help of climate models, scientists have conducted an impressive array of studies, looking for possible links between human activities and extreme events such as heat waves, rainfall and flooding events, droughts, storms, and wildfires. Increasingly, they’re able to draw robust connections. There are reductions in the number of cold waves, increases in the number of heat waves on the ocean and on land, increases in the intensity of rainfall and drought, and increases in the intensity of wildfires. Despite the complications and uniqueness of individual events, scientists are finding significant human contributions to many of them. An interactive produced by CarbonBrief in 2020, shown below, provides visible evidence of these studies. On it, red dots represent different extreme events where scientists have found a substantial contribution from human activities – that is, human activities have made these events more frequent or more intense. For some of the blue dots, however (associated with rainfall events), scientists have yet to find a substantial human contribution. Events with a big thermodynamic component – that is, those where there’s a big impact because of heat – are being made more intense or more frequent because of human activities. In contrast, for extreme events that are more dependent on the dynamics of the atmosphere, the links to human activities are less clear. Here are a few examples of extreme events where scientists are finding connections to human activities. The continued increase in global mean temperatures in response to rising levels of greenhouse gases sets the expectation that we’ll see a corresponding increase in global heat extremes. Indeed, this is being borne out by daily temperature data across the globe. , such as the devastating event that took place in the Pacific Northwest this summer, suggest such events have become tens to hundreds of times more likely because of human-driven climate change. A of how often heat waves are occurring, as well as their cumulative intensity (how many days heat waves last above a certain temperature level), published last year by Australian scientists from the Climate Change Research Centre and the University of New South Wales Canberra, reveals a clear increase of more than two days per decade in the number of heat wave days since the 1950s. The intensity of droughts is increasing. It’s not so much that scientists are seeing less rainfall, though that’s certainly happening in some places. Rather, in places where drought conditions exist, soils are becoming drier due to other factors, such as increased soil evaporation and decreased snowpack, which is reducing the amount of river flow during summer and fall. In the American Southwest, scientists estimate human-caused climate change is making droughts 30 to 50 percent more intense. When it does rain, we’re also seeing trends in how much rain falls. A prime example is Hurricane Harvey, which caused devasting flooding in parts of Texas in 2017. The storm dropped up to 40 inches (102 centimeters) of rain on some areas. In locations where scientists have data of sufficient quality, observations are showing an increasing intensity of rainfall. This is coincident with the observed overall increase in atmospheric water vapor (about four percent per degree Fahrenheit of warming). The more water vapor that air contains, the more it can rain out during convection or as air masses collide. There have been hurricanes and intense storms throughout history, so what’s changed? Model studies confirm that, for instance, about 20 percent of Harvey’s rainfall was attributable to human-produced warming of the climate and waters in the Gulf of Mexico. More generally, climate simulations confirm that this increased intensity is a robust result. It’s important to note that impacts from extreme events are mainly a question of thresholds – the amount of flooding needed to overtop a levee, or overwhelm storm drains – so every inch (of additional rain) counts. So, while total rainfall may increase only slightly, it’s the extreme precipitation events that disproportionately cause problems. The combination of models and observations, informed by the unique view that space provides, imply that almost all the current multi-decadal trends we’re seeing in climate are the result of human activities. In addition, there’s increasing confidence that human-induced climate change is making extreme events statistically much more likely. This doesn’t mean every extreme event has a substantial human contribution. But with extreme events such as heat waves, wildfires and intense precipitation, we’re seeing, in event after event, a very clear human fingerprint. The information will help people who live in coastal areas prepare for impacts caused by rising sea levels. Earth’s ocean is rising, disrupting livelihoods and infrastructure in coastal communities around the world.

Water vapor is also a key part of Earth’s water cycle: the path that all water follows as it moves around Earth’s atmosphere, land, and ocean as liquid water, solid ice, and gaseous water vapor. Since the late 1800s, global average surface temperatures have increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius). Data from satellites, weather balloons, and ground measurements confirm the amount of atmospheric water vapor is increasing as the climate warms. (The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report states total atmospheric water vapor is increasing 1 to 2% per decade.) For every degree Celsius that Earth’s atmospheric temperature rises, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can increase by about 7%, according to the laws of thermodynamics. Some people mistakenly believe water vapor is the main driver of Earth’s current warming. But increased water vapor doesn’t global warming. Instead, it’s a consequence of it. Increased water vapor in the atmosphere amplifies the warming caused by other greenhouse gases. It works like this: As greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane increase, Earth’s temperature rises in response. This increases evaporation from both water and land areas. Because warmer air holds more moisture, its concentration of water vapor increases. Specifically, this happens because water vapor does not condense and precipitate out of the atmosphere as easily at higher temperatures. The water vapor then absorbs heat radiated from Earth and prevents it from escaping out to space. This further warms the atmosphere, resulting in even more water vapor in the atmosphere. This is what scientists call a \"positive feedback loop.\" Scientists estimate this effect more than doubles the warming that would happen due to increasing carbon dioxide alone. The greenhouse gases in the dry air in Earth’s atmosphere include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons. While making up around 0.05% of Earth’s total atmosphere, they play major roles in trapping Earth’s radiant heat from the Sun and keeping it from escaping into space. Each is driven directly by human activities. All five of these greenhouse gases are . Non-condensable gases can’t be changed into liquid at the very cold temperatures present at the top of Earth’s troposphere, where it meets the stratosphere. As atmospheric temperatures change, the concentration of non-condensable gases remains stable. But water vapor is a different animal. It’s – it can be changed from a gas into a liquid. Its concentration depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. This makes water vapor the only greenhouse gas whose concentration increases the atmosphere is warming, and causes it to warm even more. If non-condensable gases weren’t increasing, the amount of atmospheric water vapor would be unchanged from its pre-industrial revolution levels. Carbon dioxide is responsible for a third of the total warming of Earth’s climate due to human-produced greenhouse gases. Small increases in its concentration have major effects. A key reason is the length of time carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere. Methane, carbon dioxide, and chlorofluorocarbons don’t condense, and they aren’t particularly chemically reactive or easily broken down by light in the troposphere. For these reasons, they remain in the atmosphere for anywhere from years to centuries or even longer, depending on the gas. In contrast, a molecule of water vapor stays in the atmosphere just nine days, on average. It then gets recycled as rain or snow. Its amounts don’t accumulate, despite its much larger relative quantities. “Carbon dioxide and other non-condensable greenhouse gases act as control knobs for the climate,” said Andrew Dessler, a professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&M University in College Station. “As humans add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, small changes in climate are amplified by changes in water vapor. This makes carbon dioxide a much more potent greenhouse gas than it would be on a planet without water vapor.” Increases in atmospheric water vapor also amplify the global water cycle. They contribute to making wet regions wetter and dry regions drier. The more water vapor that air contains, the more energy it holds. This energy fuels intense storms, particularly over land. This results in more extreme weather events. But more evaporation from the land also dries soils out. When water from intense storms falls on hard, dry ground, it runs off into rivers and streams instead of dampening soils. This increases the risk of drought. In short, when atmospheric water vapor meets increased levels of other greenhouse gases, its impacts on Earth’s climate are substantial.

        "content": "7 min read NASA Science Editorial Team How hot is too hot? As Earth’s climate warms, heat waves are becoming more frequent and severe. The health dangers of extreme heat have scientists and medical experts increasingly concerned. And for good reason: heat stress is a leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States each year. A recent example is the record-breaking heat wave that hit the U.S. Pacific Northwest last summer, killing hundreds. Extreme levels of heat stress have more than doubled over the past 40 years. That trend is expected to continue, says Colin Raymond of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Raymond is lead author of a 2020 study on extreme heat and humidity, published in Science Advances. Weather forecasters use different tools to assess the potential for heat stress. Indeed, measurements of heat stress figure prominently in your daily weather report. In addition to forecasts of temperature and relative humidity, you’ll see something called the heat index, or apparent temperature. The heat index is a measure of what the air temperature feels like to our bodies when relative humidity is factored in. Calculated for shady areas, the heat index reflects how uncomfortable we feel when it’s hot and humid. Because the heat index requires calibration, it’s a somewhat subjective measurement. In fact, different countries use different versions of it. For this reason, scientists conducting global climate studies are looking increasingly at another measure of heat stress called wet-bulb temperature. Wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which an object can cool down when moisture evaporates from it. The lower the wet-bulb temperature, the easier it is for us to cool down. It measures how well our bodies cool down by sweating when it’s hot and humid, and tells us if conditions may be harmful to our health, or even deadly. Both wet-bulb temperature and heat index are calculated using data on air temperature and humidity -- the two most important factors that affect heat stress. However, wet-bulb temperature is measured using a different technique. Originally, wet-bulb temperature was measured by wrapping a wet cloth around the bulb of a thermometer and exposing it to air. As water evaporated from the cloth, the thermometer recorded the drop in temperature. The higher the relative humidity, the less moisture evaporated before the bulb and the surrounding air are the same temperature. Today, wet-bulb temperature is typically calculated using measurements from electronic instruments at weather stations. Raymond says the highest wet-bulb temperature that humans can survive when exposed to the elements for at least six hours is about 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). Wet-bulb temperatures are on the rise around the world, and Earth’s climate has begun to exceed this limit. Since 2005, wet-bulb temperature values above 95 degrees Fahrenheit have occurred for short periods of time on nine separate occasions in a few subtropical places like Pakistan and the Persian Gulf. They also appear to be becoming more frequent. In addition, incidences of slightly lower wet-bulb temperature values in the 90 to 95-degree Fahrenheit (32 to 35-degree Celsius) range have more than tripled over the 40 years studied by Raymond’s team. The results have important implications. The hotter it is, the more strain our bodies feel, and the more we need to sweat to cool down. But humid air has less capacity to hold additional moisture, so water evaporates more slowly in humid conditions. Think about when you step out of a hot shower. Water evaporates off your body and you feel cooler. But if it’s hot or humid (or both) in the room, it’s harder to feel cool. This feeling relates directly to what the wet-bulb temperature is measuring. As long as the wet-bulb temperature is well below your skin temperature, your body can release heat to your surroundings through radiation and sweating. But as the wet-bulb temperature approaches your core temperature, you lose the ability to cool down. This triggers changes in your body. You dehydrate. Your organs become stressed, especially your heart. Blood rushes to your skin to try to release heat, starving your internal organs. The results can be deadly. “Once the wet-bulb temperature exceeds 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), no amount of sweating or other adaptive behavior is enough to lower your body to a safe operating temperature,” Raymond said. “Most of the time it’s not a problem, because the wet-bulb temperature is usually 5-to-10 degrees Celsius below body temperature, even in hot, humid places.” Indeed, if humidity is low, extreme temperatures are tolerable. “If you’re sitting in the shade with unlimited drinking water in California’s Death Valley, conditions may not be pleasant, but they’re survivable,” Raymond said. “But in humid regions, once you approach wet-bulb temperatures of 34-to-36 degrees Celsius (93-to-97 degrees Fahrenheit), it doesn’t matter what you’re doing. You can’t survive for extended periods of time.” Those most susceptible to high wet-bulb temperatures include the elderly, people who work outside, and those with underlying health issues. People without access to air conditioning are also vulnerable. Air conditioning removes humidity from the air and is the best solution when wet-bulb temperatures get too high. Fans can help sweat evaporate more efficiently, but they’re less effective. Raymond noted that people die of heat stress at wet-bulb temperatures much lower than 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). For example, the wet-bulb temperature during the June 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave was closer to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius). Many places with extreme wet-bulb temperatures are in developing countries in the subtropics with few reliable long-term weather stations. This makes it difficult to fully understand extreme heat events. However, satellite data can help identify hot spots and the processes that drive high wet-bulb temperature in such locations. That’s where NASA Earth observations play an important role. Instruments in space like the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite and the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment (ECOSTRESS) on the International Space Station (ISS) provide useful data for studying heat stress. Scientists are using these data to develop computer models of regional heat events. These models allow them to zoom in on specific places to study their temperature and humidity in detail. Future projects, like NASA’s Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission, presently under formulation, will provide even higher-resolution data on important processes like evaporation. These new tools can also help provide the necessary data to calculate a more advanced metric of heat stress, called the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). WBGT also uses temperature and humidity data, but factors in wind speed, sun angle, and cloud cover (solar radiation), variables for which reliable data are limited across much of the globe. A prototype Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature product is being developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for improved heat-stress forecasts in the United States. However, wet-bulb temperature remains the standard for measuring oppressive heat and humidity, particularly for long-term global climate research. Raymond says it’s hard to say when we might see global wet-bulb temperatures regularly topping 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). That’s because it’s a complex process that’s happening gradually and unfolding differently in different places. But climate models tell us certain regions are likely to exceed those temperatures in the next 30-to-50 years. The most vulnerable areas include South Asia, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea by around 2050; and Eastern China, parts of Southeast Asia, and Brazil by 2070. The United States isn’t immune, however. Within 50 years, Midwestern states like Arkansas, Missouri, and Iowa will likely hit the critical wet-bulb temperature limit. The information will help people who live in coastal areas prepare for impacts caused by rising sea levels. Earth’s ocean is rising, disrupting livelihoods and infrastructure in coastal communities around the world.

        "content": "3 min read NASA Science Editorial Team The longest record of direct measurements of carbon dioxide (CO ) in Earth’s atmosphere comes from Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These measurements began in 1957 and continue today, painting a clear picture of how CO has been changing over the seasons, years, and decades. Mauna Loa is an active volcano, though, so how can scientists be sure that the volcano itself is not the cause of rising CO measured there? There are several answers to this question. Mauna Loa Observatory sits in an isolated location so it can capture clean air flowing over the Pacific Ocean. There is little direct influence from pollution due to the vastness of the ocean, but there are some local, natural processes that can change the amount of CO over short amounts of time (such as a few hours). For instance, nearby plants and trees can temporarily draw CO out of the air through . Gases from Mauna Loa’s crater, which is 4 miles (6 kilometers) away from the observatory, can temporarily raise the amount of CO in the air. Prevailing winds generally prevent volcanic gases from reaching the observatory, but when the wind is light, it can happen. However, the influx of volcanic CO is immediately noticeable because the readings jump upward sharply, and by amounts far larger than normal seasonal fluctuations. These brief spikes are not included in the final data because they’re caused by short-term, local variations, and they don’t reflect the long-term average that the observatory strives to measure. Another way to answer the question is to look at CO data from other parts of the world. If Mauna Loa data were contaminated by the volcano, then those measurements would look different from air samples collected in Alaska or at the South Pole. Air samples are regularly collected from observatories, tall towers, aircraft, and weather balloons at locations worldwide. These data from around the planet all follow the same trend. Lastly, NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatories, and , were designed to measure CO from space. Instead of collecting samples from individual locations, these instruments use their lofty vantage points to make around 100,000 measurements around the world each day. Continuous global observations can see short-term changes in CO concentrations, and can be used to estimate CO emissions from cities and . These missions also help scientists learn more about how carbon dioxide is stored and released by natural processes, which is important because the natural environment soaks up more than half of the CO that is emitted by human activities. Accurate measurements of greenhouse gases are essential to our understanding of climate change, and the amount of CO in the atmosphere is measured by many different methods and all around the world. By using more than one approach, scientists can be sure they’re measuring a global trend, as well as local variations. Data from NISAR will improve our understanding of such phenomena as earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides, as well as damage to infrastructure. We don’t always notice it, but much of Earth’s surface is in constant motion.

But […] Earth’s far northern reaches have locked carbon underground for millennia. New research paints a picture of a landscape in change.

Methane (CH ) is a powerful greenhouse gas, and is the second-largest contributor to climate warming after carbon dioxide (CO ). A molecule of methane traps more heat than a molecule of CO , but methane has a relatively short lifespan of 7 to 12 years in the atmosphere, while CO can persist for hundreds of years or more. Methane comes from both natural sources and human activities. An estimated 60% of today’s methane emissions are the result of human activities. The largest sources of methane are agriculture, fossil fuels, and decomposition of landfill waste. Natural processes account for 40% of methane emissions, with wetlands being the largest natural source. (Learn more about the .) The concentration of methane in the atmosphere has more than doubled over the past 200 years. Scientists estimate that this increase is responsible for 20 to 30% of climate warming since the Industrial Revolution (which began in 1750). Although it’s relatively simple to measure the amount of methane in the atmosphere, it’s harder to pinpoint where it’s coming from. NASA scientists are using several methods to track methane emissions. One tool that NASA uses is the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation, or . This instrument, which gets mounted onto research planes, measures light that is reflected off Earth’s surface. Methane absorbs some of this reflected light. By measuring the exact wavelengths of light that are absorbed, the AVIRIS-NG instrument can determine the amount of greenhouse gases present. NASA added the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation ( ) instrument to the International Space Station in 2022. Though built principally to study dust storms and sources, researchers , known as “super-emitters.” These aircraft and satellite instruments are finding methane rising from oil and gas production, pipelines, refineries, landfills, and animal agriculture. In some cases, these measurements have led to leaks being fixed, including suburban gas leaks and faulty equipment in oil and gas fields. The Arctic is a source of natural methane from wetlands, lakes, and thawing permafrost. Although a warming climate could change these emissions, scientists . To this end, NASA’s Arctic Boreal and Vulnerability Experiment, or , has been coming from natural sources like thawing permafrost in Alaska and Canada.

        "content": "5 min read NASA Science Editorial Team We often think of aerosols as spray paint, insect repellant, or similar substances sprayed from a can. But aerosols are actually small particles or droplets that float in the air, and it turns out these little particles can have big effects on Earth’s climate. Aerosols come in many forms. They can be natural, like wildfire smoke, volcanic gases, or salty sea spray. Human activities can also generate aerosols, such as particles of air pollution or soot. The role of aerosols in climate science is complex. In general, light-colored particles in the atmosphere will reflect incoming sunlight and cause cooling. Dark-colored particles absorb sunlight and make the atmosphere warmer. Because different types of particles have different effects, aerosols are a hot topic in climate research. Explosive volcanic eruptions can inject gases all the way into the , which is the that begins around 33,000 feet (10,000 meters) overhead. Volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide gas, which combines with water in the atmosphere to form tiny particles that can circle the globe and stay in the air for a few years, depending on how big the plume is and how high it goes. These light-colored sulfate aerosols block incoming sunlight and cool the atmosphere. Mount Pinatubo’s enormous eruption in 1991 is a recent example. The sulfates from the eruption by 0.7 to 0.9° F (0.4 to 0.5 °C) and made 1992 and 1993 the coolest years in the past 35 years. Burning fossil fuels releases sulfate particles and sulfur dioxide (SO ) which, like volcanic aerosols, can reflect sunlight and make the atmosphere cooler. Unlike volcanic aerosols, air pollution does not travel very high in the atmosphere, so it only lasts for 3 to 5 days. But air pollution aerosols are produced continuously, so these particles are a constant presence. In an ironic twist of climate science, air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels has a slight cooling effect on the planet, which is the opposite of the warming caused by greenhouse gases. Air polluted by fossil fuels leads to the premature death of around globally each year. Tiny particles emitted during fossil fuel combustion can be inhaled, and they can cause asthma, respiratory infections, lung cancer, and heart disease. The COVID-19 pandemic showed what can happen if the humans reduce their aerosol pollution. Fossil-fueled air travel, driving, electricity use, and industrial activity all decreased sharply in the spring of 2020. This led to cleaner, clearer air, which -- up to 0.2 to 0.5° F (0.1 to 0.3° C) -- in some places. But at the same time, this reduction in air pollution was estimated to have saved in Europe and in China. And people in some cities enjoyed clear horizons and views for the first time in years. Soot is made of dark particles of carbon from burning fossil fuels, wood, or other plant matter. These dark particles absorb sunlight and warm the atmosphere. Soot leads to additional warming when it settles onto snow and ice because it makes the surface darker, which causes faster melting. Wildfires, cooking fires, industrial activities, and diesel engines are of soot. Reducing soot emissions would have a quick cooling effect on the atmosphere, which would bring the added benefit of improving human health. Scientists are working to better understand the ways aerosols interact with clouds. Some aerosols from human pollution can change the size or lifetime of water droplets inside clouds. When water droplets become smaller, clouds reflect more sunlight. Overall, this has a cooling effect on the atmosphere. Similarly, some aerosols like dust can influence how ice particles form in colder clouds. This is an area of active research, so stay tuned for updates as the science develops. If not for aerosol pollution, Earth would be even warmer than it already is. Aerosol air pollution has made the planet about 0.7° F (0.4 °C) cooler than it otherwise would be, according to the 2021 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). For comparison, greenhouse gas emissions have added 2.7°F (1.5°C) of warming. This makes for an interesting predicament. It might seem that air pollution is oddly helpful to counteract climate change. But that doesn’t mean we need air pollution to keep the world slightly cooler. As people and economies shift to energy forms that emit less particulate pollution, there will be a gradual reduction in air pollution aerosols, which could cause a temporary warming effect. Because these changes will occur gradually over several decades, it’s to cause much of a temperature rise. Over the long haul, reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases will more than make up for any temporary warming. Plus, cleaner air will save millions of lives.

Supported studies use space-based, aircraft-based, and other remote sensing techniques to understand the factors controlling the retreat (shrinking) and advance (growth) of the world’s sea- and land-based ice and how polar ice interacts with the ocean, atmosphere, solid Earth, and solar radiation. The program sponsors several polar initiatives designed to encourage an integrated approach to cryospheric science problems, such as the annual , NASA-ESA Snow on Sea Ice (NESOSI) initiative, and the . The supports Earth system modeling and data assimilation to simulate past and present conditions on Earth and help predict them in the future. These models examine all aspects of the Earth at a variety of timescales, including changes that occur over days to months and decades to hundreds of years. The program uses observations from satellites, aircraft, and ground-based instruments and inputs them into models to better understand the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere, and cryosphere as individual and integrated systems. This approach helps validate satellite observations and improves current Earth system models. MAP supports this work through both directed funding of the and the models, as well as through annual competed grants as a part of the solicitations. The supports research on the ocean’s role in climate variability. The ocean modulates our planet’s climate and weather by storing and transporting large quantities of heat, water, moisture, and carbon dioxide, as well as exchanging these elements with the atmosphere. This continuous exchange influences climate and weather patterns over the globe by releasing the heat that fuels the overlying atmospheric circulation, aerosols that impact cloud cover, and moisture that determines the fate of the global hydrological cycle, and by absorbing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide for millennia. NASA’s Physical Oceanography program supports basic research and analysis activities that enable development of NASA’s current and future physical oceanography satellite missions and the scientific interpretation of data from them.

Credit: NASA A case study involving Europe’s largest coal-fired power plant shows space-based observations can be used to track carbon dioxide emissions – and reductions – at the source. A duo of Earth-observing missions has enabled researchers to detect and track carbon dioxide (CO ) emission changes from a single facility, using the world’s fifth-largest coal-fired power plant as a test case. In the , researchers used space-based measurements from NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) 2 and 3 missions to quantify the carbon dioxide discharged hundreds of miles below at Bełchatów Power Station in Poland, the largest single emitter in Europe. Analyzing the plant’s emission plumes from several satellite overpasses between 2017 and 2022, they detected changes in carbon dioxide levels that were consistent with hourly fluctuations in electricity generation. Temporary and permanent unit shutdowns (for maintenance or decommissioning) reduced the plant’s overall emissions, which the team was able to detect as well. The findings demonstrate that space-based observations can be used to track carbon dioxide emission changes at a local scale, the scientists said. Launched in 2014, NASA’s maps natural and human-made (anthropogenic) on scales ranging from regions to continents. The instrument samples the gas indirectly by measuring the intensity of sunlight reflected off Earth’s surface and absorbed by carbon dioxide in the column of air from the ground to the satellite. OCO-2’s spectrometers are tuned to detect the specific signature of CO gas. Spare components from that mission were used to create , an instrument that has flown on the International Space Station since 2019. OCO-3 was designed with a mapping mode that can make multiple sweeping observations as the space station passes over an area, allowing researchers to create detailed mini-maps from a city-scale area of interest. Neither OCO instrument was originally designed specifically to detect emissions from individual facilities such as Bełchatów, so the new findings are a “pleasant surprise,” said Abhishek Chatterjee, project scientist for the OCO-3 mission at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “As a community we are refining the tools and techniques to be able to extract more information from the data than what we had originally planned,” he added. “We are learning that we can actually understand a lot more about anthropogenic emissions than what we had previously expected.” Emissions from large facilities such as power plants and refineries account for of global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. Bełchatów Power Station, in operation since 1988, is the largest lignite-fired power plant in the world, with a reported capacity of 5,102 megawatts. Lignite (brown coal) typically leads to higher emissions per megawatt generated than anthracite (hard coal). The Polish government has drafted plans to close the plant by the end of 2036. Ray Nassar, a senior researcher at Environment and Climate Change Canada and the study’s lead author, noted that most carbon dioxide emissions reports are created from estimates or data collected at the land surface. Researchers account for the mass of fossil fuels purchased and used, then calculate the expected emissions; they generally do not make actual atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements. “The finer details about exactly when and where emissions occur are often not available,” Nassar said. “Providing a more detailed picture of carbon dioxide emissions could help to track the effectiveness of policies to reduce emissions. Our approach with OCO-2 and OCO-3 can be applied to more power plants or modified for carbon dioxide emissions from cities or countries.” Because of the mapping mode observations of OCO-3, NASA data could be used more extensively in quantifying CO point-source emissions in the future. NASA recently announced that mission operations will be extended for several more years aboard the space station, and the instrument will operate alongside another greenhouse gas observer aboard the space station, the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation ( ). “It is really exciting to think that we will get another five to six years of operations with OCO-3,” Chatterjee said. “We are seeing that making measurements at the right time and at the right scale is critical.” He added that OCO-3 can serve as a “pathfinder” for next-generation satellite missions.

        "content": "Built to help scientists understand how dust affects climate, the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation can also pinpoint emissions of the potent greenhouse gas. NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation ( ) mission is mapping the prevalence of key minerals in the planet’s dust-producing deserts – information that will advance our understanding of airborne dust’s effects on climate. But EMIT has demonstrated another crucial capability: detecting the presence of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In the data EMIT has collected since being installed on the International Space Station in July, the science team has identified more than 50 “super-emitters” in Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Southwestern United States. Super-emitters are facilities, equipment, and other infrastructure, typically in the fossil-fuel, waste, or agriculture sectors, that emit methane at high rates. “Reining in methane emissions is key to limiting global warming. This exciting new development will not only help researchers better pinpoint where methane leaks are coming from, but also provide insight on how they can be addressed – quickly,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “The International Space Station and NASA’s more than two dozen satellites and instruments in space have long been invaluable in determining changes to the Earth’s climate. EMIT is proving to be a critical tool in our toolbox to measure this potent greenhouse gas – and stop it at the source.” Methane absorbs infrared light in a unique pattern – called a spectral fingerprint – that EMIT’s imaging spectrometer can discern with high accuracy and precision. The instrument can also measure carbon dioxide. The new observations stem from the broad coverage of the planet afforded by the space station’s orbit, as well as from EMIT’s ability to scan swaths of Earth’s surface dozens of miles wide while resolving areas as small as a soccer field. “These results are exceptional, and they demonstrate the value of pairing global-scale perspective with the resolution required to identify methane point sources, down to the facility scale,” said David Thompson, EMIT’s instrument scientist and a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the mission. “It’s a unique capability that will raise the bar on efforts to attribute methane sources and mitigate emissions from human activities.” Relative to carbon dioxide, methane makes up a fraction of human-caused greenhouse-gas emissions, but it’s estimated to be 80 times more effective, ton for ton, at trapping heat in the atmosphere in the 20 years after release. Moreover, where for centuries, methane persists for about a decade, meaning that if emissions are reduced, the atmosphere will respond in a similar timeframe, leading to slower near-term warming. Identifying methane point sources can be a key step in the process. With knowledge of the locations of big emitters, operators of facilities, equipment, and infrastructure giving off the gas can quickly act to limit emissions. EMIT’s methane observations came as scientists verified the . Over its mission, EMIT will collect measurements of surface minerals in arid regions of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Australia. The data will help researchers better understand airborne dust particles’ role in heating and cooling Earth’s atmosphere and surface. “We have been eager to see how EMIT’s mineral data will improve climate modeling,” said Kate Calvin, NASA’s chief scientist and senior climate advisor. “This additional methane-detecting capability offers a remarkable opportunity to measure and monitor greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.” The mission’s study area coincides with known methane hotspots around the world, enabling researchers to look for the gas in those regions to test the capability of the imaging spectrometer. “Some of the plumes EMIT detected are among the largest ever seen – unlike anything that has ever been observed from space,” said Andrew Thorpe, a research technologist at JPL leading the EMIT methane effort. “What we’ve found in a just a short time already exceeds our expectations.” For example, the instrument detected a plume about 2 miles (3.3 kilometers) long southeast of Carlsbad, New Mexico, in the Permian Basin. One of the largest oilfields in the world, the Permian spans parts of southeastern New Mexico and western Texas. In Turkmenistan, EMIT identified 12 plumes from oil and gas infrastructure east of the Caspian Sea port city of Hazar. Blowing to the west, some plumes stretch more than 20 miles (32 kilometers). The team also identified a methane plume south of Tehran, Iran, at least 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) long, from a major waste-processing complex. Methane is a byproduct of decomposition, and landfills can be a major source. Scientists estimate flow rates of about 40,300 pounds (18,300 kilograms) per hour at the Permian site, 111,000 pounds (50,400 kilograms) per hour in total for the Turkmenistan sources, and 18,700 pounds (8,500 kilograms) per hour at the Iran site. The Turkmenistan sources together have a similar flow rate to the 2015 Aliso Canyon gas leak, which exceeded 110,000 pounds (50,000 kilograms) per hour at times. The Los Angeles-area disaster was among the largest methane releases in U.S. history. With wide, repeated coverage from its vantage point on the space station, EMIT will potentially find hundreds of super-emitters – some of them previously spotted through air-, space-, or ground-based measurement, and others that were unknown. “As it continues to survey the planet, EMIT will observe places in which no one thought to look for greenhouse-gas emitters before, and it will find plumes that no one expects,” said Robert Green, EMIT’s principal investigator at JPL. EMIT is the first of a new class of spaceborne imaging spectrometers to study Earth. One example is Carbon Plume Mapper ( ), an instrument in development at JPL that’s designed to detect methane and carbon dioxide. JPL is working with a nonprofit, , along with other partners, to launch two satellites equipped with CPM in late 2023. EMIT was selected from the Earth Venture Instrument-4 solicitation under the Earth Science Division of NASA Science Mission Directorate and was developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech in Pasadena, California. It launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon resupply spacecraft from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 14, 2022. The instrument’s data will be delivered to the NASA Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) for use by other researchers and the public. The International Space Station hosts seven instruments for NASA Earth Science that are providing novel information for understanding our changing planet.

        "content": "Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the planet, causing climate change. Human activities have raised the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide content by 50% in less than 200 years. Carbon dioxide (CO ) is an important heat-trapping gas, also known as a greenhouse gas, that comes from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), from wildfires, and natural processes like volcanic eruptions. The first graph shows atmospheric CO levels at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. The second graph shows CO levels during Earth’s last three glacial cycles, as captured by air bubbles trapped in ice sheets and glaciers. Since the onset of industrial times in the 18th century, human activities have raised atmospheric CO by 50% – meaning the amount of CO is now 150% of its value in 1750. This human-induced rise is greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago. The animated map shows how the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm currently. It's important to understand that “parts per million” refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. These measurements are from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground. This data provides insights into the significant rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, highlighting the impact of human activities on Earth's climate. A closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend. This annual rise and fall of CO levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a massive scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO back to the atmosphere. A similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global seasonal cycle more closely aligns with the northern pattern. See the cycle in action in the visualization . This boom-and-bust cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO ."

        "meta_description": "The Arctic Ocean's sea ice blanket has already lost most of its old ice and two-thirds of its thickness. The younger ice is thinning more slowly and variably.",
        "content": "4 min read NASA Science Editorial Team The Arctic Ocean's blanket of sea ice has changed since 1958 from predominantly older, thicker ice to mostly younger, thinner ice, according to published by NASA scientist Ron Kwok of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. With so little thick, old ice left, the rate of decrease in ice thickness has slowed. New ice grows faster but is more vulnerable to weather and wind, so ice thickness is now more variable, rather than dominated by the effect of global warming. Working from a combination of satellite records and declassified submarine sonar data, NASA scientists have constructed a 60-year record of Arctic sea ice thickness. Right now, Arctic sea ice is the youngest and thinnest its been since we started keeping records. More than 70 percent of Arctic sea ice is now seasonal, which means it grows in the winter and melts in the summer, but doesn't last from year to year. This seasonal ice melts faster and breaks up easier, making it much more susceptible to wind and atmospheric conditions. Kwok's research, published today in the journal Environmental Research Letters, combined decades of declassified U.S. Navy submarine measurements with more recent data from four satellites to create the 60-year record of changes in Arctic sea ice thickness. He found that since 1958, Arctic ice cover has lost about two-thirds of its thickness, as averaged across the Arctic at the end of summer. Older ice has shrunk in area by almost 800,000 square miles (more than 2 million square kilometers). Today, 70 percent of the ice cover consists of ice that forms and melts within a single year, which scientists call seasonal ice. Sea ice of any age is frozen ocean water. However, as sea ice survives through several melt seasons, its characteristics change. Multiyear ice is thicker, stronger and rougher than seasonal ice. It is much less salty than seasonal ice; Arctic explorers used it as drinking water. Satellite sensors observe enough of these differences that scientists can use spaceborne data to distinguish between the two types of ice. Thinner, weaker seasonal ice is innately more vulnerable to weather than thick, multiyear ice. It can be pushed around more easily by wind, as happened in the summer of 2013. During that time, prevailing winds piled up the ice cover against coastlines, which made the ice cover thicker for months. The ice's vulnerability may also be demonstrated by the increased variation in Arctic sea ice thickness and extent from year to year over the last decade. In the past, sea ice rarely melted in the Arctic Ocean. Each year, some multiyear ice flowed out of the ocean into the East Greenland Sea and melted there, and some ice grew thick enough to survive the melt season and become multiyear ice. As air temperatures in the polar regions have warmed in recent decades, however, large amounts of multiyear ice now melt within the Arctic Ocean itself. Far less seasonal ice now thickens enough over the winter to survive the summer. As a result, not only is there less ice overall, but the proportions of multiyear ice to seasonal ice have also changed in favor of the young ice. Seasonal ice now grows to a depth of about six feet (two meters) in winter, and most of it melts in summer. That basic pattern is likely to continue, Kwok said. \"The thickness and coverage in the Arctic are now dominated by the growth, melting and deformation of seasonal ice.\" The increase in seasonal ice also means record-breaking changes in ice cover such as those of the 1990s and 2000s are likely to be less common, Kwok noted. In fact, there has not been a new record sea ice minimum since 2012, despite years of warm weather in the Arctic. \"We've lost so much of the thick ice that changes in thickness are going to be slower due to the different behavior of this ice type,\" Kwok said. Kwok used data from U.S. Navy submarine sonars from 1958 to 2000; satellite altimeters on NASA's ICESat and the European CryoSat-2, which span from 2003 to 2018; and scatterometer measurements from NASA's QuikSCAT and the European ASCAT from 1999 to 2017.

Imagine these gases as a cozy blanket enveloping our planet, helping to maintain a warmer temperature than it would have otherwise. Greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a 'feedback', because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially caused the warming. Scientists have determined that carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of Earth's atmosphere. If carbon dioxide were removed, the terrestrial greenhouse effect would collapse, and Earth's surface temperature would drop significantly, by approximately 33°C (59°F). Greenhouse gases are part of Earth's atmosphere. This is why Earth is often called the 'Goldilocks' planet – its conditions are just right, not too hot or too cold, allowing life to thrive. Part of what makes Earth so amenable is its natural greenhouse effect, which maintains an average temperature of 15 C (59 F) . However, in the last century, human activities, primarily from burning fossil fuels that have led to the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, have disrupted Earth's energy balance. This has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean. The level of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere has been rising consistently for decades and traps extra heat near Earth's surface, causing temperatures to rise.

If lost completely, both ice sheets contain enough water to raise sea level by 66 meters (217 feet). This visualization shows the effect on coastal regions for each meter of sea level rise, up to 6 meters (19.7 feet). Land that would be covered in water is shaded red. This time series shows global changes in the concentration and distribution of carbon dioxide since 2002 at an altitude range of 1.9 to 8 miles. The yellow-to-red regions indicate higher concentrations of CO2, while blue-to-green areas indicate lower concentrations, measured in parts per million. This color-coded map shows a progression of changing global surface temperatures since 1884. Dark blue indicates areas cooler than average. Dark red indicates areas warmer than average. Satellite observations show that the polar ice sheets shed a combined 418 billion metric tons of ice per year between 2002 and 2023, contributing the most to global sea level rise. The leading cause of this melt is the human burning of fossil fuels. These images show those changes, with oranges and reds indicating ice losses, while light blues illustrate ice gains. Gray areas show ice flow lines as they lead to prominent valley glaciers, which are areas with the most declines. The ocean has absorbed 90% of human-induced global warming since 1955, causing the water's internal heat to rise. As a result, this change is contributing to polar ice loss, global sea level rise, extreme weather, large-scale coral bleaching events, and other far-reaching consequences. This visualization shows warming (also called \"ocean heat content\") in the ocean's upper 2,000 meters, or about 6,600 feet, in five-year averages. Reds show gained heat compared to the long-term average, while blues indicate lost heat.

        "content": "Earth's average surface temperature in 2022 effectively tied with 2015 as the fifth warmest on record, according to an analysis by NASA. Continuing the planet's long-term warming trend, global temperatures in 2022 were 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.89 degrees Celsius) above the average for NASA's baseline period (1951-1980), scientists from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York reported. “This warming trend is alarming,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “Our warming climate is already making a mark: Forest fires are intensifying; hurricanes are getting stronger; droughts are wreaking havoc and sea levels are rising. NASA is deepening our commitment to do our part in addressing climate change. Our Earth System Observatory will provide state-of-the-art data to support our climate modeling, analysis and predictions to help humanity confront our planet’s changing climate.” The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880. This means Earth in 2022 was about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 1.11 degrees Celsius) warmer than the late 19th century average. “The reason for the warming trend is that human activities continue to pump enormous amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and the long-term planetary impacts will also continue,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of GISS, NASA's leading center for climate modeling. Human-driven greenhouse gas emissions have rebounded following a in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, NASA scientists, as well as international scientists, determined carbon dioxide emissions were the in 2022. NASA also identified some of methane – another powerful greenhouse gas – using the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation instrument that launched to the International Space Station last year. The Arctic region continues to experience the strongest warming trends – close to four times the global average – according to presented at the 2022 annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union, as well as a separate . Communities around the world are experiencing impacts scientists see as connected to the warming atmosphere and ocean. Climate change has intensified rainfall and tropical storms, deepened the severity of droughts, and increased the impact of storm surges. Last year brought rains that devastated Pakistan and a persistent in the U.S. Southwest. In September, became one of the strongest and costliest hurricanes to strike the continental U.S. NASA’s global temperature analysis is drawn from data collected by weather stations and Antarctic research stations, as well as instruments mounted on ships and ocean buoys. NASA scientists analyze these measurements to account for uncertainties in the data and to maintain consistent methods for calculating global average surface temperature differences for every year. These ground-based measurements of surface temperature are consistent with satellite data collected since 2002 by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder on NASA's Aqua satellite and with other estimates. NASA uses the period from 1951-1980 as a baseline to understand how global temperatures change over time. That baseline includes climate patterns such as La Niña and El Niño, as well as unusually hot or cold years due to other factors, ensuring it encompasses natural variations in Earth's temperature. Many factors can affect the average temperature in any given year. For example, 2022 was one of the warmest on record despite a third consecutive year of La Niña conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean. NASA scientists estimate that La Niña’s cooling influence may have lowered global temperatures slightly (about 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit or 0.06 degrees Celsius) from what the average would have been under more typical ocean conditions. A separate, by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) concluded that the global surface temperature for 2022 was the sixth highest since 1880. NOAA scientists use much of the same raw temperature data in their analysis and have a different baseline period (1901-2000) and methodology. Although rankings for specific years can differ slightly between the records, they are in broad agreement and both reflect ongoing long-term warming. NASA's through 2022, as well as full details with code of how NASA scientists conducted the analysis, are publicly available from GISS.

        "content": "By Angela Colbert, Ph.D., NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory The Landsat 8 satellite’s Operational Land Imager captured this image of coral reefs in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, on August 22, 2020. The Great Barrier Reef is the largest reef system in the world. Satellites provide scientists with important information on the environment around coral reefs, including ocean temperatures and water quality. This helps them understand changes to corals over time. Credit: Data from NASA and other institutions show that the global decline in coral reefs is mainly driven by climate change and other human actions, including pollution. While some corals survive even under harsh conditions, scientists emphasize the importance of taking action to better protect and manage reefs. Coral reefs are one of the most important ecosystems in the world. Together they support over a quarter of all known marine species, protect coastlines during storms, and help local economies through fisheries and tourism. However, decades of data, collected in part from NASA’s airborne and satellite missions, show that corals are . Human actions, like burning fossil fuels, are shifting our global climate by warming the air and ocean. But that isn’t the only way: Pollution and physical damage from ships and divers also play a role. Let’s dive deeper into the different ways that humans are impacting corals. The burning of fossil fuels has been the main driver of . Based on NASA’s project, the total heat stored by the oceans (ocean heat content) rose 187 from 1992 through 2019. And most corals can’t take the heat. According to Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, professor of marine studies at the University of Queensland in Australia, corals are fine-tuned to their environment. Thus, even small changes in temperature can stress a coral out. This can lead to coral bleaching. Bleaching occurs when stressed corals expel their , revealing their underlying white skeleton. Once a coral is bleached, it becomes more vulnerable to any additional stressors, including those from diseases and storms. Historically, corals would have 20 years or so to recover between stressful events (marine heat waves or cold spells, disease, or storms). However, with climate change, the frequency of events like marine heat waves, is increasing, leaving corals with insufficient time to recover. Over time, this leads to the loss of habitat for the thousands of marine creatures that depend on the reef for survival. Warming water isn’t the sole issue. The ocean also acts as a sponge that absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere -- and human activities have produced a lot of it. This increase in carbon dioxide causes the ocean to become , which is now happening at a rate faster than at . “If you put a coral skeleton into a soda, the soda’s acid will dissolve it in about an hour,” said Ved Chirayath, professor of Earth sciences at the University of Miami in Florida. “Similarly, as the ocean becomes more acidic, corals struggle to make their structures and can’t grow as quickly.” This is because coral skeletons are made from a type of calcium carbonate. When carbon dioxide is added to ocean water, chemical reactions lead to carbonate ions bonding with excess hydrogen ions instead of with calcium ions. Essentially, less calcification occurs, which makes it . If the water becomes too acidic, it can begin to dissolve the skeletons themselves. While climate change is the primary factor disrupting coral reefs, other human actions also contribute to their decline. “Pollution -- including chemicals, fertilizer, and other toxins that travel from the land into the ocean -- is also a problem,” stated Liane Guild, research scientist with NASA’s Ames Research Center in California and a representative on the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force (USCRTF). “Divers or commercial fishermen who don’t know how to properly treat a reef can also cause physical damage,” added Juan Torres-Pérez, research scientist with NASA Ames and a representative on USCRTF. Physical damage can include breaking a coral by accidentally stepping on it or dropping an anchor on it, as examples. All of these impacts combined have led scientists to conclude that human actions are the primary cause of the observed global decline in corals. “If you look at the rate of decline, it is human-driven. There is no other explanation,” said Hoegh-Guldberg. Since human actions are the problem, can we do anything to help corals survive? Current predictions for emissions of greenhouse gases place almost all reef without human intervention. “Taking urgent action to get to pre-industrial emission levels will allow corals and other life to rebound,” said Chirayath. “It’s up to us, as the species who rapidly changed the climate, to change it back.” Some corals are adjusting. “There are these amazing adaptations that corals are doing as they find ways to survive in harsh conditions,” said Guild. For example, a recent found that some reefs in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean are becoming more heat tolerant by being able to change which algae, or , they host. Scientists are working to and develop methods to grow and reintroduce them into the ocean. The success of these corals gives many scientists hope, but they know that corals can’t do it alone. NASA is helping in part by sharing its decades of data with the world. For example, in a recent , scientists used satellite data to give people important information about their local reefs so that they could take actions to protect them.

        "content": "“Global warming” refers to the long-term warming of the planet. “Climate change” encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet, including rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times. “Weather” refers to the more local changes in the climate we see around us, on short timescales from minutes to hours, to days to weeks. Examples are familiar – rain, snow, clouds, winds, thunderstorms, sleet, and hail. “Climate” refers to longer-term averages (which may be regional or global) and can be thought of as the weather averaged over several decades. Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. However, if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the rise in global temperatures would begin to flatten within a few years. Temperatures would then plateau but remain well-elevated for many, many centuries. Yes, the vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists – 97 percent – agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change. NASA’s role is to make observations of our Earth's systems (geosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere)--and how they connect--that can be used by the public, researchers, policymakers and to support strategic decision-making. The core responsibility of NASA is to conduct rigorous scientific research. It's important to clarify that NASA does not advocate for specific climate policies. Climate researchers employ a wide range of direct and indirect measurements to thoroughly investigate Earth's climate history. These measurements include data from natural sources like tree rings, ice cores, corals, and sediments from oceans and lakes. Additionally, data from satellites in space, instruments on the International Space Station, aircraft, ships, buoys, and ground-based instruments are all vital for this research. This comprehensive array of data sources allows scientists to gain a detailed understanding of Earth's climate history. Modern weather observations primarily originate from a network of sources, including , weather balloons, radar systems, ships, buoys, and satellites. No. The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) utilizes temperature data for conducting long-term climate studies. To ensure the reliability of station data for such research, it's crucial that the time series of observations are consistent. We need to eliminate any temperature fluctuations that are not caused by climate-related factors. These fluctuations can occur due to station relocations, equipment upgrades, or the merging of data from various sources into a single dataset. Not yet. In order to use temperature data effectively, we have to make adjustments to account for all the changes that have occurred over the past 100-150 years. Major climate research organizations worldwide have developed mathematically rigorous, peer-reviewed data-processing methods to identify and compensate for changes in observing conditions. The global temperature records calculated by U.S. and other countries are remarkably similar, even though they use different methods to process the data. NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and other respected groups subject their techniques and processed data to extensive peer-reviewed analyses. Almost half of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) corrected data are cooler than the original records. NOAA's corrections of temperatures over the oceans — done to compensate for changes in methods of observing the temperature of water at the surface of the ocean — reduced the warming trend in global temperature. No, the original records are preserved and are available at no cost online. You can access the National Climatic Data Center's (NCDC) U.S. and global records . The greenhouse effect is the process through which heat is trapped near Earth's surface by substances known as 'greenhouse gases.' Imagine these gases as a cozy blanket enveloping our planet, helping to maintain a warmer temperature than it would have otherwise. Greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a 'feedback', because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially caused the warming. The amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO ) absorbed by Earth's life forms, ocean, and other \"sinks\" might decrease as time goes by. Natural carbon sinks (the carbon absorbers, as opposed to \"sources,\" which release carbon) on land and in the ocean have become less effective over time. That is, natural sinks that removed about 60% of annual human-caused CO emissions in 1959 now remove about today. Contrary to common belief, it's actually cow belching caused by a process called enteric fermentation that contributes to methane emissions. Since MOXIE works by ingesting carbon dioxide – the gas that’s mostly driving climate change here on Earth – and produces oxygen, a lot of people wondered whether it could it be helpful on our own planet. But while technology is part of any plan for addressing climate change, the conversion that MOXIE accomplished on Mars is not a viable approach. Three of the world’s most complete temperature tracking records, maintained by NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Climactic Data Center and the UK Meteorological Office’s Hadley Centre, begin in 1880. The oldest continuous temperature record is the Central England Temperature Data Series, which began in 1659, and the Hadley Centre has some measurements beginning in 1850, but there are too few data before 1880 for scientists to estimate average temperatures for the entire planet. Yes, evidence shows warming from 1998 to the present, with 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 being the hottest years globally since 1880. Satellites technically do not measure either temperature or the surface (where people live). Therefore, it's safe to say that ground thermometers are more accurate than satellite measurements. Yes, the ocean is continuing to warm. Notably, all ocean basins have been experiencing significant warming since 1998, with more heat being transferred deeper into the ocean since 1990. While urban areas are warmer than surrounding rural areas, the urban heat island effect has had little to no impact on our warming world because scientists have accounted for it in their measurements. Data from NASA's GRACE satellites, which measured Earth’s gravity field, show that the land ice sheets in both Antarctica and Greenland have been losing mass (ice) since 2002. On average, most of Earth’s mountain glaciers are continuing to melt. Arctic sea ice volume and extent have been declining since record-keeping began in the late 1970s and prior. Antarctic sea ice extent is currently . Surface mass balance is the difference between the precipitation (rain and snow) that has accumulated on the upper surfaces of glaciers and ice sheets and what has been lost due to melt, eventual runoff, and evaporation.Total mass balance is the difference between total mass gains and total mass losses, which includes ice lost in the lower margins due to calving and thinning from contact with warm ocean waters. Melting land ice, like mountain glaciers and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, will change Earth’s rotation only if the meltwater flows into the ocean. For example, if the Greenland ice sheet were to completely melt and the meltwater were to completely flow into the ocean, then global sea level would rise by about seven meters (23 feet) and Earth would rotate more slowly, with the length of the day becoming longer than it is today, by about 2 milliseconds.Melting sea ice, such as the Arctic ice cap, does not change sea level because the ice displaces its volume and, hence, does not change Earth’s rotation. No. The Sun can influence Earth’s climate, but it isn’t responsible for the warming trend we’ve seen in recent decades. No. Even if the amount of radiation coming from the Sun were to decrease as it has before, it would not significantly affect the global warming coming from long-lived, human-emitted greenhouse gases. Further, given our greenhouse gas emissions to date and those expected to come, the evidence points to the next “ice age” being averted altogether. Volcanic eruptions are often discussed in the context of climate change because they release CO2 and other gases into our atmosphere. However, the impact of human activities on the carbon cycle far exceeds that of all the world's volcanoes combined, by more than 100 times.To put it in perspective, while volcanic eruptions do contribute to an increase in atmospheric CO2, human activities release an amount of CO2 equivalent to what a Mount St. Helens-sized eruption produces every 2.5 hours and a Mount Pinatubo-sized eruption twice daily. Yes and no. The ozone hole is not causing global warming, but it is affecting atmospheric circulation. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO ) in the atmosphere is measured by many different methods, all around the world. By using more than one approach, scientists can be sure they’re measuring a global trend, rather than a local variation. Both! In general, light-colored particles in the atmosphere will reflect incoming sunlight and cause a cooling effect. Dark-colored particles absorb sunlight and make the atmosphere warmer. Because different types of particles have different effects, aerosols are a hot topic in climate research. Ice cores are scientists’ best source for historical climate data. Other tools for learning about Earth’s ancient atmosphere include growth rings in trees, which keep a rough record of each growing season’s temperature, moisture and cloudiness going back about 2,000 years. Corals also form growth rings that provide information about temperature and nutrients in the tropical ocean. Other proxies, such as benthic cores, extend our knowledge of past climate back about a billion years.

        "content": "4 min read NASA Science Editorial Team Earth’s atmosphere has five major and several secondary layers. From lowest to highest, the major layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere. Earth’s troposphere extends from Earth’s surface to, on average, about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) in height, with its height lower at Earth’s poles and higher at the equator. Yet this very shallow layer is tasked with holding all the air plants need for photosynthesis and animals need to breathe, and also contains about 99 percent of all water vapor and aerosols (minute solid or liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere). In the troposphere, temperatures typically go down the higher you go, since most of the heat found in the troposphere is generated by the transfer of energy from Earth’s surface. The troposphere is the densest atmospheric layer, compressed by the weight of the rest of the atmosphere above it. Most of Earth’s weather happens here, and almost all clouds that are generated by weather are found here, with the exception of cumulonimbus thunder clouds, whose tops can rise into the lowest parts of the neighboring stratosphere. Most aviation takes place here, including in the transition region between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Located between approximately 12 and 50 kilometers (7.5 and 31 miles) above Earth’s surface, the stratosphere is perhaps best known as home to Earth’s ozone layer, which protects us from the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. Because of that UV radiation, the higher up you go into the stratosphere, the warmer temperatures become. The stratosphere is nearly cloud- and weather-free, but polar stratospheric clouds are sometimes present in its lowest, coldest altitudes. It’s also the highest part of the atmosphere that jet planes can reach. Located between about 50 and 80 kilometers (31 and 50 miles) above Earth’s surface, the mesosphere gets progressively colder with altitude. In fact, the top of this layer is the coldest place found within the Earth system, with an average temperature of about minus 85 degrees Celsius (minus 120 degrees Fahrenheit). The very scarce water vapor present at the top of the mesosphere forms noctilucent clouds, the highest clouds in Earth’s atmosphere, which can be seen by the naked eye under certain conditions and at certain times of day. Most meteors burn up in this atmospheric layer. Sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft can reach the mesosphere. Located between about 80 and 700 kilometers (50 and 440 miles) above Earth’s surface is the thermosphere, whose lowest part contains the ionosphere. In this layer, temperatures increase with altitude due to the very low density of molecules found here. It is both cloud- and water vapor-free. The aurora borealis and aurora australis are sometimes seen here. The International Space Station orbits in the thermosphere. Located between about 700 and 10,000 kilometers (440 and 6,200 miles) above Earth’s surface, the exosphere is the highest layer of Earth’s atmosphere and, at its top, merges with the solar wind. Molecules found here are of extremely low density, so this layer doesn’t behave like a gas, and particles here escape into space. While there’s no weather at all in the exosphere, the aurora borealis and aurora australis are sometimes seen in its lowest part. Most Earth satellites orbit in the exosphere. While there’s really no clear boundary between where Earth’s atmosphere ends and outer space begins, most scientists use a delineation known as the Karman line, located 100 kilometers (62 miles) above Earth’s surface, to denote the transition point, since 99.99997 percent of Earth’s atmosphere lies beneath this point. A February 2019 study using data from the NASA/European Space Agency Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft suggests, however, that the farthest reaches of Earth’s atmosphere — a cloud of hydrogen atoms called the geocorona — may actually extend nearly 391,000 miles (629,300 kilometers) into space, far beyond the orbit of the Moon. ' On a changing planet, where phenomena like severe hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires are becoming more severe, scientists need data to assess and model disaster impacts and to potentially make predictions about hazards.

The animation shows sea surface height anomalies around the world: Red and orange indicate ocean heights that were higher than the global mean sea surface height, while blue represents heights lower than the mean. Sea level differences can highlight ocean currents, like the Gulf Stream coming off the U.S. East Coast or the Kuroshio current off the east coast of Japan. Sea surface height can also indicate regions of relatively warmer water – like the eastern part of the equatorial Pacific Ocean during an – because water expands as it warms. The SWOT science team made the measurements using the groundbreaking Ka-band Radar Interferometer ( ) instrument. With two antennas spread 33 feet (10 meters) apart on a boom, KaRIn produces a pair of data swaths (tracks visible in the animation) as it circles the globe, bouncing radar pulses off the water’s surface to collect surface-height measurements. “The detail that SWOT is sending back on sea levels around the world is incredible,” said Parag Vaze, SWOT project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “The data will advance research into the effects of climate change and help communities around the world better prepare for a warming world.” on Dec. 16, 2022, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in central California, SWOT is now in its operations phase, collecting data that will be used for research and other purposes. SWOT was jointly developed by NASA and CNES, with contributions from CSA (Canadian Space Agency) and the UK Space Agency. JPL, which is managed for the agency by Caltech in Pasadena, California, leads the U.S. component of the project. For the flight system payload, NASA provided the KaRIn instrument, a GPS science receiver, a laser retroreflector, a two-beam microwave radiometer, and NASA instrument operations. CNES provided the Doppler Orbitography and Radioposition Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system, the dual frequency Poseidon altimeter (developed by Thales Alenia Space), the KaRIn radio-frequency subsystem (together with Thales Alenia Space and with support from the UK Space Agency), the satellite platform, and ground operations. CSA provided the KaRIn high-power transmitter assembly. NASA provided the launch vehicle and the agency’s Launch Services Program, based at Kennedy Space Center, managed the associated launch services. To learn more about SWOT, visit: Jane J.

However, the impact of human activities on the carbon cycle far exceeds that of all the world's volcanoes combined, by more than . To put it in perspective, while volcanic eruptions do contribute to an increase in atmospheric CO2, human activities release an amount of CO2 equivalent to what a Mount St. Helens-sized eruption produces and a Mount Pinatubo-sized eruption . The most significant eruptions come from super volcanoes like Yellowstone or Mount Toba, which erupt very rarely, about every 100,000 to 200,000 years or more. Yet, the total annual CO2 emissions from human activities are akin to one or more Yellowstone-sized super eruptions occurring every year. In essence, CO2 emissions from human activities greatly surpass those from volcanoes. Climate scientists mention volcanic eruptions to help us understand and explain short periods of cooling in Earth's history. Approximately every few decades, a volcanic eruption, such as Mount Pinatubo or El Chichón, releases a substantial number of particles and gases. Some of these particles and gases temporarily block enough sunlight to induce a brief global cooling period. While these effects typically dissipate after 1 to 2 years, their impact is felt across the globe. In comparison, the warming caused by greenhouse gases resulting from human activities, primarily from burning fossil fuels, will persist for millennia.

        "content": "By Sally Younger, NASA's Earth Science News Team Tundra wetlands are shown in late spring at the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Scientists are studying how fire and ice drive methane emissions in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, within which the refuge is located. Credit: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Methane ‘hot spots’ in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta are more likely to be found where recent wildfires burned into the tundra, altering carbon emissions from the land. In Alaska’s largest river delta, tundra that has been scorched by wildfire is emitting more methane than the rest of the landscape long after the flames died, scientists have found. The potent greenhouse gas can originate from decomposing carbon stored in permafrost for thousands of years. Its release could accelerate climate warming and lead to more frequent wildfires in the tundra, where blazes have been historically rare. The was conducted by a team of scientists working as part of NASA’s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment ( ), a large-scale study of environmental change in Alaska and Western Canada. Researchers found that methane hot spots were roughly 29% more likely to occur in tundra that had been scorched by wildfire in the past 50 years compared to unburned areas. The correlation nearly tripled in areas where a fire burned to the edge of a lake, stream, or other standing-water body. The highest ratio of hot spots occurred in recently burned wetlands. The researchers first observed the methane hot spots using NASA’s next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer ( ) in 2017. Mounted on the belly of a research plane, the instrument has an optical sensor that records the interaction of sunlight with molecules near the land surface and in the air, and it has been used to measure and monitor hazards ranging from oil spills to . Roughly hot spots – defined as areas showing an excess of 3,000 parts per million of methane between the aircraft and the ground – were detected across some 11,583 square miles (30,000 square kilometers) of the Arctic landscape. Regionally, the number of hot spot detections in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta were anomalously high in 2018 surveys, but scientists didn’t know what was driving their formation. To help fill this gap, Elizabeth Yoseph, an intern at the time with the ABoVE campaign, focused on a methane-active region located in a wet and peaty area of the massive delta. Yoseph and the team used the AVIRIS-NG data to pinpoint hot spots across more than 687 square miles (1,780 square kilometers), then overlaid their findings on historical wildfire maps. “What we uncovered is a very clear and strong relationship between fire history and the distribution of methane hot spots,” said Yoseph, lead author of the new study. The connection arises from what happens when fire burns into the carbon-rich frozen soil, or permafrost, that underlies the tundra. Permafrost sequesters carbon from the atmosphere and can store it for tens of thousands of years. But when it thaws and breaks down in wet areas, flourishing microbes feed on and convert that old carbon to methane gas. The saturated soils around lakes and wetlands are especially rich stocks of carbon because they contain large amounts of dead vegetation and animal matter. “When fire burns into permafrost, there are catastrophic changes to the land surface that are different from a fire burning here in California, for example,” said Clayton Elder, co-author and scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which developed AVIRIS-NG. “It’s changing something that was frozen to thawed, and that has a cascading impact on that ecosystem long after the fire.” Because of the cool marshes, low shrubs, and grasses, tundra wildfires are relatively rare compared to those in other environments, such as evergreen-filled forests. However, by some projections the fire risk in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta could quadruple by the end of the century due to warming conditions and increased lightning storms – the leading cause of tundra fires. Two of the on record in Alaska occurred in 2022, burning more than 380 square miles (100,000 hectares) of primarily tundra landscapes. More research is needed to understand how a future of increasing blazes at high latitudes could impact the global climate. Arctic permafrost holds an estimated of carbon – roughly 51 times the amount of carbon the world released as fossil fuel emissions in 2019. All that stored carbon also means that the carbon intensity of fire emissions from burning tundra is extremely high, said co-author Elizabeth Hoy, a fire researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “Tundra fires occur in areas that are remote and difficult to get to, and often can be understudied,” she noted. “Using satellites and airborne remote sensing is a really powerful way to better understand these phenomena.” The scientists hope to continue exploring methane hot spots occurring throughout Alaska. Ground-based investigation is needed to better understand the links between fire, ice, and greenhouse gas emissions at the doorstep of the Arctic.

The Sun is a giver of life; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. We know subtle changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the ice ages. But the warming we’ve seen in recent decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth’s orbit and too large to be caused by solar activity. One of the “smoking guns” that tells us the Sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of solar energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites, which tell us that there has been no upward trend in the amount of solar energy reaching our planet. A second smoking gun is that if the Sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a buildup of heat-trapping gases near Earth's surface, and not by the Sun getting “hotter.” NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery."

        "content": "An unusually high tide, called a King Tide, floods a highway on-ramp in Northern California in January 2023. Sea level rise and El Niños can exacerbate this type of flooding. Credit: California King Tides Project Such high-tide flooding that inundates roads and buildings along the west coast of the Americas tends to be uncommon outside of El Niño years, but that could change by the 2030s. An analysis by NASA’s sea level change science team finds that if a strong El Niño develops this winter, cities along the western coasts of the Americas could see an increase in the frequency of high-tide flooding that can swamp roads and spill into low-lying buildings. El Niño is a periodic climate phenomenon characterized by higher-than-normal sea levels and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures along the equatorial Pacific. These conditions can spread poleward along the western coasts of the Americas. El Niño, which is still developing this year, can bring more rain than usual to the U.S. Southwest and drought to countries in the western Pacific like Indonesia. These impacts typically occur in January through March. The NASA analysis finds that a strong El Niño could result in up to five instances of a type of flooding called a 10-year flood event this winter in cities including Seattle and San Diego. Places like La Libertad and Baltra in Ecuador could get up to three of these 10-year flood events this winter. This type of flooding doesn’t normally occur along the west coast of the Americas outside of El Niño years. The researchers note that by the 2030s, rising seas and climate change could result in these cities experiencing similar numbers of 10-year floods annually, with no El Niño required. “I’m a little surprised that the analysis found these 10-year events could become commonplace so quickly,” said Phil Thompson, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii and a member of NASA’s sea level change science team, which performed the analysis. “I would have thought maybe by the 2040s or 2050s.” Ten-year floods are those that have a one in 10 chance of occurring in any given year. They’re a measure of how high local sea levels become: The extent of flooding in a particular city or community depends on several factors, including a region’s topography and the location of homes and infrastructure relative to the ocean. Ten-year floods can result in what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration classifies as moderate flooding, with some inundation of roads and buildings, and the possible need to evacuate people or move belongings to higher ground. NASA’s coastal flooding analysis finds that by the 2030s, during strong El Niño years, cities on the west coast of the Americas could see up to 10 of these 10-year flood events. By the 2050s, strong El Niños may result in as many as 40 instances of these events in a given year. , so sea levels tend to be higher in places with warmer water. Researchers and forecasters monitor ocean temperatures as well as water levels to spot the formation and development of an El Niño. “Climate change is already shifting the baseline sea level along coastlines around the world,” said Ben Hamlington, a sea level researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and lead for the agency’s sea level change science team. Sea levels are rising in response to planetary warming, as Earth’s atmosphere and ocean are heating up and ice sheets and shelves melt. This has already coastal cities experience throughout the year. Phenomena like El Niños and storm surges, which temporarily boost sea levels, compound these effects. Missions that monitor sea levels, including the Surface Water and Ocean Topography ( ) satellite and , help to monitor El Niños in the near term. SWOT in particular, collects data on sea levels right up to the coast, which can help to improve sea level rise projections. That kind of information could aid policymakers and planners in preparing their communities for rising seas in the next decades. “As climate change accelerates, some cities will see flooding five to 10 times more often. SWOT will keep watch on these changes to ensure coastal communities are not caught off guard,” said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, SWOT program scientist and director of the ocean physics program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

This data is used to inform decision-makers on ways to mitigate, adapt and respond to climate change. All of NASA’s Earth science data is available for scientists and the public to access in a variety of ways. “NASA studies our home planet and its interconnected systems more than any other planet in our universe,” said Karen St. Germain, director of NASA’s Earth Science Division. “‘A Passage of Water’ provides an opportunity to highlight the public availability of SWOT data and other NASA Earth science data to tell meaningful stories, improve awareness, and help everyday people who have to make real decisions in their homes, businesses, and communities.” A collaboration between NASA and the French space agency CNES (Centre National d’Études Spatiales), SWOT is measuring the height of on Earth’s surface, providing one of the most detailed, comprehensive views yet of the planet’s freshwater bodies. SWOT provides insights into how the ocean influences climate change and how a warming world affects lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. “The detail that SWOT is providing on the world’s oceans and fresh water is game-changing. We’re only just getting started with respect to data from this satellite, and I’m looking forward to seeing where the information takes us,” said Ben Hamlington, a research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. The Google project also uses data from the GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions –the former is a joint effort between NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), while the latter is a collaboration between NASA and the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). GRACE tracked localized changes to Earth’s mass distribution, caused by phenomena including the movement of water across the planet from 2002 to 2017. GRACE-FO came online in 2018 and is currently in operation. As with GRACE before it, the GRACE-FO mission monitors changes in ice sheets and glaciers, near-surface and underground water storage, the amount of water in large lakes and rivers, as well as changes in sea level and ocean currents, providing an integrated view of how Earth’s water cycle and energy balance are evolving. “A Passage of Water” is the most recent digital experience created under NASA’s Space Act Agreement with Google, with resulting content to be made widely available to the public free of charge on Google’s web platforms.

        "content": "Yes and no. The ozone hole is basically a human-caused hole in the ozone layer above the South Pole during the Southern Hemisphere’s spring. The ozone layer, which lies high in the atmosphere, shields us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays that come from the Sun. Human activities effectively punched a hole in it, through the use of gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in spray cans and refrigerants, which break down ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere. While some extra UV rays slip through the ozone hole, their net effect is to cool the stratosphere more than they warm the troposphere. (Learn more about Earth's atmosphere here: .) So, this increase in UV rays cannot explain the warming of the planet's surface. The good news is many governments recognized the danger CFCs posed on Earth’s ozone layer, and international agreements were made and acted upon in the 1980s to reduce the production of CFCs. Furthermore, these chemicals were replaced by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Since the 1990s, surface UV levels have been relatively stable, and ozone hole recovery has contributed to less surface UV than expected. However, while HFCs have helped the ozone layer recover, they still cause some harm, resulting in the area reforming more slowly than once thought. Ozone holes still form regularly in Antarctica. While scientists expect the ozone hole to recover over time, there are still many natural forces affecting its progress. For example, given the long lifespan of ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere, it will take decades for the hole to return to pre-industrial levels. The latest data from NASA satellites show that our ozone layer is recovering and that a short-lived resurgence in the emission of ozone-depleting pollutants in eastern China will not significantly delay the revival of Earth’s protective “sunscreen” layer. In summary, negative changes in the ozone layer are being offset by positive changes in human behavior, allowing the ozone layer to reform. The role the ozone hole itself plays in global warming and the resulting climate change is small compared to the impacts coming from human activities.

        "meta_description": "Part Two: Satellites from NASA and other space agencies are revealing surprising new insights into atmospheric carbon dioxide, the principal human-produced driver of climate change.",
        "content": "10 min read NASA Science Editorial Team Earth’s atmosphere is resilient to many of the changes humans have imposed on it. But, says atmospheric scientist David Crisp of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, that doesn’t necessarily mean that our society is. “The resilience of Earth’s atmosphere has been proven throughout our planet’s climate history,” said Crisp, science team lead for NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite and its successor instrument, OCO-3, which launched to the International Space Station on May 4. “Humans have increased the abundance of carbon dioxide by 45 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Age. That’s making big changes in our environment, but at the same time, it’s not going to lead to a runaway greenhouse effect or something like that. So, our atmosphere will survive, but, as suggested by UCLA professor and Pulitzer-Prize-winning author Jared Diamond, even the most advanced societies can be more fragile than the atmosphere is.” Changes to our atmosphere associated with reactive gases (gases that undergo chemical reactions) like ozone and ozone-forming chemicals like nitrous oxides, are relatively short-lived. Carbon dioxide is a different animal, however. Once it’s added to the atmosphere, it hangs around, for a time: between 300 to 1,000 years. Thus, as humans change the atmosphere by emitting carbon dioxide, those changes will endure on the timescale of many human lives. Earth’s atmosphere is associated with many types of cycles, such as the carbon cycle and the water cycle. Crisp says that while our atmosphere is very stable, those cycles aren’t. “Humanity’s ability to thrive depends on these other planetary cycles and processes working the way they now do,” he said. “Thanks to detailed observations of our planet from space, we’ve seen some changes over the last 30 years that are quite alarming: changes in precipitation patterns, in where and how plants grow, in sea and land ice, in entire ecosystems like tropical rain forests. These changes should attract our attention. “One could say that because the atmosphere is so thin, the activity of 7.7 billion humans can actually make significant changes to the entire system,” he added. “The composition of Earth’s atmosphere has most certainly been altered. Half of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the last 300 years has occurred since 1980, and one quarter of it since 2000. Methane concentrations have increased 2.5 times since the start of the Industrial Age, with almost all of that occurring since 1980. So changes are coming faster, and they’re becoming more significant.” The concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere is currently at nearly 412 parts per million (ppm) and rising. This represents a 47 percent increase since the beginning of the Industrial Age, when the concentration was near 280 ppm, and an 11 percent increase since 2000, when it was near 370 ppm. Crisp points out that scientists know the increases in carbon dioxide are caused primarily by human activities because carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a different ratio of heavy-to-light carbon atoms, so it leaves a distinct “fingerprint” that instruments can measure. A relative decline in the amount of heavy carbon-13 isotopes in the atmosphere points to fossil fuel sources. Burning fossil fuels also depletes oxygen and lowers the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen in the atmosphere. OCO-2, launched in July 2014, gathers global measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the resolution, precision and coverage needed to understand how this important greenhouse gas — the principal human-produced driver of climate change — moves through the Earth system at regional scales, and how it changes over time. From its vantage point in space, OCO-2 makes roughly 100,000 measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide every day. Crisp says OCO-2 has already provided new insights into the processes emitting carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and those that are absorbing it. “For as long as we can remember, we’ve talked about Earth’s tropical rainforests as the ‘lungs’ of our planet,” he said. “Most scientists considered them to be the principal absorber and storage place of carbon dioxide in the Earth system, with Earth’s northern boreal forests playing a secondary role. But that’s not what’s being borne out by our data. We’re seeing that Earth’s tropical regions are a net of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, at least since 2009. This changes our understanding of things.” Measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the tropics are consistently higher than anything around them, and scientists don’t know why, Crisp said. OCO-2 and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) are tracking plant growth in the tropics by observing solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from chlorophyll in plants. SIF is an indicator of the rate at which plants convert light from the Sun and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into chemical energy. “We’re finding that plant respiration is outstripping their ability to absorb carbon dioxide,” he said. “This is happening throughout the tropics, and almost all of the time. When we first launched OCO-2, our first two years of on-orbit operations occurred during a strong El Niño event, which had a strong impact on global carbon dioxide emissions. Now we have more than five years of data, and we see that the tropics are always a source (of carbon dioxide), in every season. In fact, the only time we see significant absorption of carbon dioxide in the tropics is in Africa during June, July and August. So that’s half the story. “The other half is also quite interesting,” he added. “We’re seeing northern mid- and high-latitude rainforests becoming better and better absorbers for carbon dioxide over time. One possible explanation for this is that the growing season is getting longer. Things that didn’t used to grow well at high latitudes are growing better and things that were growing well there before are growing longer. We’re seeing that in our data set. We see that South America’s high southern latitudes — the so-called cone of South America — are also strong absorbers for carbon. We don’t know if it was always this way and our previous understandings were incomplete or wrong, or if climate change has increased the intensity of the growing season. So we’ve established a new baseline, and it appears to be somewhat of a paradigm shift. Our space-based measurements are beginning to change our understanding of how the carbon cycle works and are providing new tools to allow us to monitor changes in the future in response to climate change.” Crisp says OCO-2, OCO-3 and other new satellites are giving us new tools to understand how, where and how much carbon dioxide human activities are emitting into the atmosphere and how those emissions are interacting with Earth’s natural cycles. “We’re getting a sharper picture of those processes,” he said. Impacts from agricultural activities also seem to be changing, he says. During summer in the U.S. upper Midwest, scientists are seeing an intense absorption of carbon dioxide associated with agricultural activities. The same thing is being observed in Eastern and Southern Asia. The strong absorption of carbon dioxide across China is erasing all but a thin strip of fossil fuel emissions along the coast, with Central China now functioning as a net absorber of carbon dioxide during the growing season. Thanks to the development of big, sophisticated computer models combined with wind and other measurements, we’re able to quantify these changes for the first time. In response to the rapid changes observed in carbon dioxide concentrations and their potential impact on our climate, 33 of the world’s space agencies, including participants from the United States, Europe, Japan and China, are now working together to develop a global greenhouse gas monitoring system that could be implemented as soon as the late 2020s, Crisp added. The system would include a series of spacecraft making coordinated measurements to monitor these changes. Key components of the system would include the OCO-2 and OCO-3 missions, Japan’s GOSAT and GOSAT-2, and Europe’s Copernicus missions. The system would be complemented by ground-based and aerial research. Crisp said he and his fellow team members are eagerly poring over the from OCO-3. The new instrument, installed on the exterior of the space station, will extend and enhance the OCO-2 data set by collecting the first dawn-to-dusk observations of variations in carbon dioxide from space over tropical and mid-latitude regions, giving scientists a better view of emission and absorption processes. This is made possible by the space station’s unique orbit, which carries OCO-3 over locations on the ground at slightly different times each orbit. The Copernicus CO2 Mission, scheduled for launch around 2025, will be the first operational carbon dioxide monitoring satellite constellation. Crisp, who’s a member of its Mission Advisory Group, said the constellation will include multiple satellites with wide viewing swaths that will be able to map Earth’s entire surface at weekly intervals. While its basic measurement technique evolved from the GOSAT and OCO-2 missions, there’s a key difference: the earlier satellites are sampling systems focused on improving understanding of Earth’s natural carbon cycle, while Copernicus will be an imaging system focused on monitoring human-produced emissions. In fact, it will have the ability to estimate the emissions of every large power plant in every city around the world. Crisp says as time goes on the objective is to build an operational system that will monitor all aspects of Earth’s environment. Pioneering satellites like OCO-2, OCO-3, GOSAT and GOSAT-2 are adding greenhouse gas measurements to the data on temperature, water vapor, cloud cover, air quality and other atmospheric properties that have been collected for decades. “We know our atmosphere is changing and that these changes may affect our civilization,” he said. “We now have the tools to monitor our atmosphere very carefully so that we can give policymakers the best information available. If you’ve invested in a carbon reduction strategy, such as converting from coal to natural gas or transitioning from fossil fuels to renewables, wouldn’t you like to know that it worked? You can only manage what you can measure.” For more on OCO-2, visit . For more on OCO-3, visit . ' By volume, the dry air in Earth’s atmosphere is about 78.08 percent nitrogen, 20.95 percent oxygen, and 0.93 percent argon. A brew of trace gases accounts for the other approximately 0.04 percent, including the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. Yet while these greenhouse gases make up just a tiny percentage of our atmosphere, they play major roles in trapping Earth’s radiant heat and keeping it from escaping into space, thereby warming our planet and contributing to Earth’s greenhouse effect. The largest greenhouse gas by volume is actually the one most people tend to overlook: water vapor, whose concentration varies significantly depending on temperature. As the temperature of the atmosphere increases, the amount of humidity in the atmosphere also goes up, further heating our planet in a vicious cycle. Tiny solid or liquid particles known as aerosols, which are produced both naturally and by human activities, are also present in variable amounts, along with human-produced industrial pollutants and natural and human-produced sulfur compounds. On a changing planet, where phenomena like severe hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires are becoming more severe, scientists need data to assess and model disaster impacts and to potentially make predictions about hazards.

        "content": "NASA is a global leader in studying Earth’s changing climate. The agency’s observations of our home planet from space, the air, and on the ground are helping us learn how the interconnected systems of our planet interact. The agency has a broad climate research program. Among the many areas NASA studies are solar activity, sea level rise, the temperature of the atmosphere and ocean, the health of the ozone layer, air pollution, and changes in sea ice and land ice. So how did the space agency end up taking such a significant role in climate science? NASA was created by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958. Although it was given the role of developing technology for “space observations,” it did not initially have much of a role in Earth science. The agency’s leaders made technology part of an Earth Observations program at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, which was established in 1959. It was an “applications” program, in NASA-speak. Other federal government agencies were responsible for carrying out Earth science research, such as the Weather Bureau (now the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). NASA’s Applications program signed cooperative agreements with these other agencies to develop technologies –such as satellites and instruments – to observe Earth from space, while NOAA and USGS analyzed the data. The series of experimental weather satellites and the series of land-observing satellites were major milestones in this era of collaborative research. During the 1970s, Congress wanted NASA to do more research to meet “national needs.” These needs included energy efficiency, pollution, ozone depletion, and climate change. In 1976, Congress revised the Space Act, authorizing NASA to research the stratospheric ozone layer. This formalized the agency’s movement into Earth sciences. NASA’s planetary science program also helped spark scientific and congressional interest in expanding the agency’s role in Earth science. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA's lead center for planetary science, sent Mariner probes to Venus and Mars. Astronomers considered these to be \"Earth-like\" planets in our solar system, meaning they seemed to be the planets most likely to support life. But that's not what they found. A super-charged greenhouse effect had roasted Venus. In contrast to Earth, Venus had about 150,000 times more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, no significant water vapor, and a surface temperature hotter than molten lead. On the other hand, Mars had an atmospheric pressure less than 1% of Earth’s and temperatures far below freezing. Pictures showed no surface water, though it would have been frozen anyway. But images also suggested that Mars once had liquid water. These discoveries left planetary scientists with many unanswered questions. How did Earth, Venus, and Mars end up so different, even though they had similar beginnings? How could Mars’s surface climate have been warm enough to be wet but is now frozen solid? These questions are at the intersection of climate, atmospheric chemistry, and life on Earth. As planetary scientists began to tackle these intriguing questions, government interest in exploring other planets waned. NASA's budget sank dramatically starting in 1977. The U.S. was battling high inflation, and the agency was focused on the Space Shuttle program, with low-orbit studies of Earth a natural extension of that shift. The same decade had seen a revolution in scientists' understanding of Earth's climate. Before the mid-1960s, geoscientists thought our climate could change only relatively slowly, on timescales of thousands of years or longer. But new evidence from ice and sediment cores showed that idea was wrong. Earth's climate had indeed changed rapidly in the past – in some cases, within mere decades. Understanding that climate could change in human lifetimes made it a much more compelling research topic. Scientists have known since 1960 that humans were increasing the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Would this warm the climate noticeably? Scientists also knew that human emissions of tiny particles called aerosols could cool Earth. Which effect would gain the upper hand? A 1975 study by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences said, in effect, we don't know, but we’d love to find out. A 1979 study of carbon dioxide's role in the climate put it slightly differently. It found that increasing greenhouse gases gave scientists \"no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.\" During the 1980s, NASA began planning for an Earth-observing system to answer questions about \"global change.\" This concept included climate change and changes in land use, the ocean, and pollution. Unlike earlier efforts, when Earth science was split between three agencies, this time, NASA would develop the technology and carry out the scientific research. In 1984, Congress again revised the Space Act, broadening NASA’s Earth science work from the stratosphere to “the expansion of human knowledge of the Earth.” In the early 1980s, NASA began working on a much larger Earth science program plan called “Global Habitability,” which eventually became the “Mission to Planet Earth.” At the same time, a multi-agency effort called the Global Change Research Program was also taking form. NASA's role in that larger U.S. program was to provide global data from space. Approved in the 1991 budget, the resulting Earth Observing System would be the agency's main contribution to climate science. Fast forward to 2007, when NASA had 17 space missions collecting climate data. Instruments on NASA’s and satellites provided the first global measurements of aerosols in our atmosphere. Those particles come from natural sources, like volcanoes and dust storms, and from human-produced sources, like burning fossil fuels. Other instruments onboard the satellite observed ozone in the upper atmosphere. Data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission; the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite mission; and other satellites showed unexpectedly fast changes in Earth's great ice sheets. The , Ocean Surface Topography Mission , and missions recorded a sea level rise of nearly 4 inches (about 10 centimeters) since 1993. The weather instruments that are part of NASA’s Earth Observing System have brought major improvements in global weather forecasting. By 2007, the accumulation of new Earth science data helped the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change – reach the conclusion that \"Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic (human-produced) greenhouse gas concentrations.\" But there's still a lot to learn about the consequences. How much warmer will it get? How much will sea level rise? NASA is currently developing the . The core of ESO is five satellite missions that will provide essential data on climate change, severe weather, natural hazards, wildfires, and global food production. These observations will address the most pressing questions about our changing planet identified in the 2017 Earth Science Decadal Survey conducted by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. The missions will focus on five areas: Based on the Academies’ recommendations, NASA will complement the core missions with innovative Earth Explorer missions that deliver additional high-priority observations. Each of the missions will deliver critical environmental measurements. Taken together, NASA will have a more complete 3D view of Earth to better understand how our planet’s complex systems work together. These missions also will improve our ability to predict how our climate may change in the future. All of these data will be free and open to the public and scientists worldwide. These observations will help inform decision-makers on how our planet is changing with greater precision on previously unimaginable scales – from entire continents down to individual trees, from the atmosphere over our heads to the bedrock below our feet. Beginning with NASA’s original missions, the agency has been focused on learning more about the world around us, whether at the edge of the solar system or right here at home.

To compensate for the lack of direct temperature data, scientists rely on reconstructed data from proxy records, such as tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores. Because these proxy records differ fundamentally from direct measurements, scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the \"instrumental record.\" The agencies mentioned above and others collect temperature data from thousands of weather stations worldwide, including over the ocean, in Antarctica, and from satellites. However, it's important to note that temperature measurement instruments were not evenly distributed across the globe, and some measurement sites have changed, like deforestation or urbanization, since 1880. These changes affect nearby temperature readings. Each agency employs algorithms to account for and mitigate the effects of these changes in the temperature record. Additionally, when data are sparse, especially over the vast Southern Ocean, these agencies use interpolation methods to estimate temperatures. In general, all four datasets agree quite closely (see graph above) and are in agreement on the global warming trend since the Industrial Revolution.

They had been created by the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, or MOXIE, an experimental piece of technology aboard NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover. MOXIE is designed to convert Martian carbon dioxide, which makes up 96% of Mars' atmosphere, into oxygen. NASA is testing this technology in the hopes of sending oxygen generators to Mars in the distant future, where they could be used to create the tens of thousands of kilograms of rocket propellant that will be needed to launch astronauts off the planet and back to Earth (as well as providing oxygen to breathe). Since MOXIE works by ingesting carbon dioxide – the gas that’s mostly driving climate change here on Earth – and produces oxygen, a lot of people wondered whether it could it be helpful on our own planet. Even on Mars, where the atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide, MOXIE requires a lot of power to do its work. On Earth, where the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is very dilute, it would take even more power – far more than was generated when burning the fuel that created the carbon dioxide in the first place. It would take enormous power plants to make all that power, and if those are fuel-burning facilities, they would create more carbon dioxide than we could recover with MOXIE technology. Even if you used clean energy power plants, it would make more sense to use them to replace our fuel-burning plants instead. MOXIE’s technology could be useful at the point where carbon dioxide is released into the air, such as smokestacks. And while it is not a form of a direct air capture technology, future versions of MOXIE could be used in conjunction with those technologies. But, for now, in order to address climate change, it would be more effective to employ strategies to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide such by reducing our emissions, carbon capture, and habitat preservation and restoration.

        "content": "The amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO ) absorbed by Earth's life forms, ocean, and other \"sinks\" might decrease as time goes by. Natural carbon sinks (the carbon absorbers, as opposed to \"sources,\" which release carbon) on land and in the ocean have become less effective over time. That is, natural sinks that removed about 60% of annual human-caused CO emissions in 1959 now remove about today. Scientists are concerned that these natural sinks might lose even more of their absorbing power in the future. For example, the ongoing deforestation in the Amazon is causing that area to transition from being a deep sink to a seasonal source of CO . The result: a greater proportion of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions could remain in the atmosphere. This would then amplify warming of Earth’s surface and ocean, with warming-driven losses from land-based ice sheets and glaciers causing further rises in global sea levels for centuries to come. Today's natural sinks are starting to become tomorrow's carbon dioxide sources, increasing the proportion in annual emissions that stay in Earth’s atmosphere. Some 20,500 years ago, at the coldest part of the last glacial phase (commonly called the Ice Age), CO levels were about 185 parts per million (ppm), based on dated samples of air trapped in ice cores taken from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Over 10,000 years later, the world warmed out of that icy era into today’s warm period, called the Holocene due to slow variations in Earth’s orbit. Over that time, CO levels increased to 265 ppm, which was about 1 ppm every 125 years. From 10,500 years ago to the year 1850, CO levels slowly increased to about 280 ppm, an increase to which early humans are thought to have contributed with the development of farming and the slow deforestation of forests over time. Since 1850, CO levels have increased from 280 ppm to around 420 ppm. Scientists understand this increase to be inextricably tied to the human burning of fossil fuels (confirmed by of that rise in CO ). That's a near 50% increase in CO levels in just 172 years (about 1 part per million every 23 weeks)! That's over 300 times faster than the natural increase in CO levels associated with the warming of Earth's surface coming out of the Ice Age.

        "content": "Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the planet, causing climate change. Human activities have raised the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide content by 50% in less than 200 years. Carbon dioxide (CO ) is an important heat-trapping gas, also known as a greenhouse gas, that comes from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), from wildfires, and natural processes like volcanic eruptions. The first graph shows atmospheric CO levels at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. The second graph shows CO levels during Earth’s last three glacial cycles, as captured by air bubbles trapped in ice sheets and glaciers. Since the onset of industrial times in the 18th century, human activities have raised atmospheric CO by 50% – meaning the amount of CO is now 150% of its value in 1750. This human-induced rise is greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago. The animated map shows how the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm currently. It's important to understand that “parts per million” refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. These measurements are from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground. This data provides insights into the significant rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, highlighting the impact of human activities on Earth's climate. A closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend. This annual rise and fall of CO levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a massive scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO back to the atmosphere. A similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global seasonal cycle more closely aligns with the northern pattern. See the cycle in action in the visualization . This boom-and-bust cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO ."

        "content": "4 min read NASA Science Editorial Team Dynamic and powerful, the ocean plays a vital role in Earth’s climate. It helps regulate Earth’s temperature, absorbs carbon dioxide (CO ) from the atmosphere, and fuels the . One of the most important functions of the ocean is to move heat around the planet via currents. The Atlantic Ocean's currents play an especially important role in our global climate. The movement of water north and south throughout the Atlantic might be weakening due to climate change, which could become a problem. To help understand why, let’s explore what drives large-scale ocean circulation. Winds and Earth’s rotation create large-scale surface currents in the ocean. Warm, fast currents along the western edges of move heat from the equator toward the North and South Poles. One such current is the Gulf Stream, which travels along the eastern coast of North America as it carries warm waters from the tropics toward Europe. This warm water, and the heat it releases into the atmosphere, is the primary reason Europe experiences a more temperate climate than the northeastern U.S. and Canada. For example, compare the climates of New York City and Madrid, Spain, which are both about the same distance north of the equator. Differences in density drive slow-moving ocean currents in the deep ocean. Density is an object’s mass (how much matter it has) per unit of volume (how much space it takes up). Both temperature and saltiness (salinity) affect the density of water. Cold water is denser than warm water, and salty water is denser than fresh water. Thus, deep currents are typically made of cold and salty water that sank from the surface. One location where surface water sinks into the deep ocean is in the North Atlantic. When water evaporates and gives up some heat to the air, the sea gets colder and a little saltier. Plus, when sea ice forms, it freezes the surface water leaving behind salt, which makes the remaining seawater saltier. Once this colder, saltier water becomes dense enough, it sinks to the deep ocean. Warmer, less dense water from the Gulf Stream rushes in to replace the water that sinks. This motion helps power a global “conveyor belt” of ocean currents – known as – that moves heat around Earth. Scientists measure the flow of Atlantic waters north and south, at the surface and in the deep, to assess the strength of this Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation (AMOC). As the concentration of carbon dioxide rises in the atmosphere from human actions, global air and ocean temperatures heat up. Warmer water is less dense, and thus harder to sink. At the same time, Greenland’s ice sheet is melting due to warming air and ocean temperatures, and the melted ice is adding fresh water into the North Atlantic. This change reduces the water’s saltiness, making it less dense and harder to sink. If enough water stops sinking, then the AMOC will weaken. Depending on how much the AMOC weakens, it can change regional weather patterns, such as rainfall, and affect where and how well crops can grow. According to the latest from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — which includes research from hundreds of scientists — the AMOC is “very likely to weaken over the 21 century” due to climate change. Scientists using temperature and sea level records have inferred the AMOC’s strength over the past century, and the evidence suggests that it might have already weakened. However, direct measurements over the past 30 years have not yet confirmed such a decline. When and how much the AMOC will weaken is an area of ongoing research. Satellites such as the , , and ocean height-measuring can observe ocean features related to the AMOC — complementing measurements from ocean buoys and ships. Current projections from the IPCC show that the AMOC is unlikely to stop, or collapse, before the year 2100. However, “if such a collapse were to occur,\" the IPCC says, \"it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and the water cycle.” These could include “a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, weakening of the African and Asian monsoons, strengthening of Southern Hemisphere monsoons, and drying in Europe,” impacts that would greatly alter food production worldwide. As more data are gathered and analyzed, scientists will be able to better predict current changes and impacts of those changes in the future. On a changing planet, where phenomena like severe hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires are becoming more severe, scientists need data to assess and model disaster impacts and to potentially make predictions about hazards.

However, if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the rise in global temperatures would begin to flatten within a few years. Temperatures would then plateau but remain well-elevated for many, many centuries. There is a time lag between what we do and when we feel it, but that lag is less than a decade. While the effects of human activities on Earth's climate to date are irreversible on the timescale of humans alive today, every little bit of avoided future temperature increases results in less warming that would otherwise persist for essentially forever. The benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions occur on the same timescale as the political decisions that lead to those reductions. Without major action to reduce emissions, global temperature is on track to rise by 2.5 C to 4.5 C (4.5 F to 8 F) by 2100, according to the latest estimates.

Record-breaking heat waves on land and in the ocean, drenching rains, severe floods, years-long droughts, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Human actions since the Industrial Revolution, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, have caused greenhouse gases to rapidly rise in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases increase, they act as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet. In response, Earth’s air and ocean temperatures warm. This warming affects the water cycle, shifts weather patterns, and melts land ice — all impacts that can make extreme weather worse. According to the released in 2021, the human-caused rise in greenhouse gases has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. NASA’s satellite missions, including the upcoming , provide vital data for monitoring and responding to extreme weather events. Research says all the risks from these extreme weather events will escalate the more the planet warms. However, also describes some climate change mitigation strategies, technological developments, and methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists use a combination of and land, air, sea, and space-based observations to research how extreme weather events change over time. First, scientists examine historical records to determine the frequency and intensity of past events. Many of these long-term records date back to the 1950s, though some start in the 1800s. Then scientists use climate models to see if the number or strength of these events is changing, or will change, due to increasing greenhouse gases when compared to what has happened historically.

        "content": "Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term. Changes observed in Earth’s climate since the mid-20th century are driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, raising Earth’s average surface temperature. Natural processes, which have been overwhelmed by human activities, can also contribute to climate change, including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El Niño, La Niña and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity, , ). Scientists use observations from the ground, air, and space, along with , to monitor and study past, present, and future climate change. Climate data records provide evidence of climate change key indicators, such as global land and ocean temperature increases; rising sea levels; ice loss at Earth’s poles and in mountain glaciers; frequency and severity changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods, and precipitation; and cloud and vegetation cover changes. “Climate change” and “global warming” are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Similarly, the terms \"weather\" and \"climate\" are sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different spatial- and timescales. Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere. This term is not interchangeable with the term \"climate change.\" Since the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased Earth’s global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a number that is currently increasing by more than 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. The current warming trend is unequivocally the result of human activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over millennia. Weather refers to atmospheric conditions that occur locally over short periods of time—from minutes to hours or days. Familiar examples include rain, snow, clouds, winds, floods, or thunderstorms. Climate, on the other hand, refers to the long-term (usually at least 30 years) regional or even global average of temperature, humidity, and rainfall patterns over seasons, years, or decades.

        "meta_description": "Researchers created a toolkit for determining the clarity and surface temperature of coastal waters. The data is freely accessible and can help assess reefs around the world.",
        "content": "Researchers created a toolkit for determining the clarity and surface temperature of coastal waters. The data is freely accessible and can help assess reefs around the world. Using two decades of NASA satellite measurements stored in the cloud, scientists recently assessed the vulnerability of Belize’s renowned coral reefs to bleaching and collapse. The findings could help management authorities protect the reefs from human impacts such as development, overfishing, pollution, and climate change. The 185-mile-long (298-kilometer-long) barrier reef system off the coast of Belize encompasses vibrant marine environments that support thousands of animal and plant species and drive the Central American country’s largest industry, tourism. The system is one of about 1,200 UNESCO World Heritage sites around the world. In a study published in , the scientists ranked 24 marine protected areas off the Belize coast based on the risks coral face from murky water and rising temperatures. The study also outlined how researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and counterparts in Belize used free, cloud-based data on Google Earth Engine in their analysis. “We depend on the reef for so many things, so conserving these resources is important,” said Emil Cherrington, a native Belizean and co-author of the paper. He is a research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and a co-investigator on the Belize Sustainable Development Goal project, a NASA effort to use Earth observation data to protect the country’s marine ecosystems. “Studies like this are giving the government of Belize more tools for conserving the resources that the country has.” The hard skeletons of stony coral form the structure of the barrier reef, which keeps Belize’s shallow coastal waters calm and enables marine life to thrive there. Coral needs clear water and consistent temperatures to grow. Changes in both factors can affect the survival of the symbiotic algae that live in the coral and provide food. When the algae leave or die, the coral lose their color, a phenomenon called bleaching. Coral can survive under these conditions, but the changes can put it at greater risk of mortality. To gather data on water clarity and surface temperature over large areas, researchers turned to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( ), which was developed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and launched in 2002 as one of several instruments aboard the agency’s satellite. In addition to being available from NASA, MODIS images and data sets are accessible on Google Earth Engine. Analyzing MODIS imagery collected from 2002 to 2022, the researchers developed a vulnerability index that characterizes the risk to coral in the marine environments that Belize is managing in order to protect biodiversity. The team examined sea surface temperatures in each protected area and assigned a number from 1 to 6 based on how low or high the averages were relative to the norms. They did the same for water clarity. The 1 to 6 ratings were then combined to get the coral index, from 2 to 12. Higher numbers signify greater risk. Port Honduras Marine Reserve, a 156-square-mile (40,469-hectare) protected area in southern Belize, showed the highest coral vulnerability score: 10 out of 12. Based on the index, the study also flagged Swallow Caye Wildlife Sanctuary, Sapodilla Cayes Marine Reserve, and Corozal Bay Wildlife Sanctuary as areas for concern. All the protected areas in the study are included in the Belize Coastal Zone Management Plan, a framework to guide Belize’s government on how to support the sustainable use of the country’s coastal areas. The country’s Coastal Zone Management Authority & Institute, which is tasked with implementing and monitoring policies that govern Belize’s coastal waters, created the last plan in 2016. The new paper, along with other Belize-focused research sponsored through NASA’s program, will inform the next plan, which is currently being revised, said Samir Rosado, a co-author of the study and a coastal planner at the management authority. “A lot of our cultural identity arises from the marine areas,” Rosado said. “It’s a measure of pride – wherever Belizeans go, people know the coral reefs.” The vulnerability index could be used for other reef systems around the world, and it could be modified to incorporate additional water variables such as acidity, said Ileana Callejas, the paper’s lead author and a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Rising ocean acidity – a consequence of climate change resulting from greater concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide in the water – threatens coral health. “We were trying to make the data and our approach as accessible as possible,” said Callejas, who started the research during an internship at JPL. “Our main purpose was to make a toolkit that would be easy to use, that would produce an index that was easy to understand, and that could be used to see which marine protected areas may need closer attention.” While the historical record and traditional field testing by boat have given coastal management authorities a sense of the most vulnerable areas, satellites can shine light on other spots that may be less accessible or more costly to reach, said Nicole Auil Gomez, a paper co-author and director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Belize Country Program. “It's going to become more useful in the future in terms of telling us more about areas we already monitor,” she said. “And for areas we don’t monitor, we have some tools now to be able to learn more.” Andrew Wang / Jane J.

        "content": "The effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible for people alive today, and will worsen as long as humans add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Global climate change is not a future problem. Changes to Earth’s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner. Effects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Some changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the (IPCC) — the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change — modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years. Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900. The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth. The severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Here are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the and National Climate Assessment Reports: Global sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms. Global climate is projected to continue warming over this century and beyond. Scientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Warming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%. Climate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. The length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture. Summer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA’s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century. Climate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below. These findings are from the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports, released by the . IPCC 2021, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. IPCC, 2013: Summary for Policymakers. In: [Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. USGCRP 2014, . USGCRP 2017, . So, the Earth's average temperature has increased about 2 degrees Fahrenheit during the 20th century. What's the big deal? “Global warming” refers to the long-term warming of the planet. “Climate change” encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet, including rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times. Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. However, if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the rise in global temperatures would begin to flatten within a few years. Temperatures would then plateau but remain well-elevated for many, many centuries.

        "content": "Human activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century. Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20 century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\" — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space. Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space. A vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO ) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Like many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane. A potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years. These chemical compounds do not exist in nature – they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO ). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO . To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 1750 . This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive in the atmosphere. In its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO , methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change The panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at . Scientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface. Studies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age. But several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun: IPCC 6 Assessment Report, WG1, Summary for Policy Makers, Sections A, “ ” IPCC 6 Assessment Report, WG1, Technical Summary, Sections TS.1.2, TS.2.1 and TS.3.1 P.

        "content": "There is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause. Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia. It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun’s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred. Earth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate. Scientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century. Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age. The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities. Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record. The ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969. Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year. Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa. Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier. Global sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and accelerating slightly every year. Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades. The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30%. This increase is due to humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the ocean. The ocean has absorbed between 20% and 30% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in recent decades (7.2 to 10.8 billion metric tons per year). IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, . B.D.

He suggested something in the atmosphere must be acting like an insulating blanket. In 1856, discovered that blanket, showing that carbon dioxide and water vapor in Earth's atmosphere trap escaping infrared (heat) radiation. In the 1860s, physicist recognized Earth's natural greenhouse effect and suggested that slight changes in the atmospheric composition could bring about climatic variations. In 1896, a seminal paper by Swedish scientist first predicted that changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could substantially alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.

        "content": "4 min read NASA Science Editorial Team The Sun powers life on Earth; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. It also influences Earth’s climate: We know subtle changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the past ice ages. But the warming we’ve seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth’s orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity. The Sun doesn’t always shine at perpetually the same level of brightness; it brightens and dims slightly, taking 11 years to complete one solar cycle. During each cycle, the Sun undergoes various changes in its activity and appearance. Levels of solar radiation go up or down, as does the amount of material the Sun ejects into space and the size and number of . These changes have a variety of effects in space, in Earth’s atmosphere and on Earth’s surface. The current solar cycle (Solar Cycle 25) began in December 2019 and has quickly ramped up in activity. Although the Sun won’t reach peak levels until 2025, it is already exceeding early predictions. NASA’s upcoming , currently scheduled to launch in 2027, will provide valuable insights into Solar Cycle 26. According to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the current scientific consensus is that long and short-term variations in solar activity play only a very small role in Earth’s climate. Warming from increased levels of human-produced greenhouse gases is actually many times stronger than any effects due to recent variations in solar activity. For more than 40 years, satellites have observed the Sun's energy output, which has gone up or down by less than 0.1 percent during that period. Since 1750, the warming driven by greenhouse gases coming from the human burning of fossil fuels is over 270 times greater than the slight extra warming coming from the Sun itself over that same time interval. As mentioned, the Sun is currently experiencing a low level of sunspot activity. Some scientists speculate that this may be the beginning of a periodic solar event called a “grand minimum,” while others say there is insufficient evidence to support that position. During a grand minimum, solar magnetism diminishes, sunspots appear infrequently and less ultraviolet radiation reaches Earth. Grand minimums can last several decades to centuries. The largest recent event happened during the “Little Ice Age” (13 to mid-19 century): the “Maunder Minimum,” an extended period of time between 1645 and 1715, when there were few sunspots. Several studies in recent years have looked at the effects that another grand minimum might have on global surface temperatures. These studies have suggested that while a grand minimum might cool the planet as much as 0.3 degrees C, this would, at best, slow down (but not reverse) human-caused global warming. There would be a small decline of energy reaching Earth, and just three years of current carbon dioxide concentration growth would make up for it. In addition, the grand minimum would be modest and temporary, with global temperatures quickly rebounding once the event concluded. Some people have linked the Maunder Minimum’s temporary cooling effect to decreased solar activity, but that change was more likely influenced by increased volcanic activity and ocean circulation shifts. Moreover, even a prolonged “Grand Solar Minimum” or “Maunder Minimum” would only briefly and minimally offset human-caused warming.

        "content": "6 min read NASA Science Editorial Team \"Pink elephant in the room\" time: There is no impending “ice age” or \"mini ice age\" if there's a reduction in the Sun’s energy output in the next several decades. Through its lifetime, the Sun naturally goes through changes in energy output. Some of these occur over a regular 11-year period of peak (many sunspots) and low activity (fewer sunspots), which are quite predictable. But every so often, the Sun becomes quieter for longer periods of time, experiencing much fewer sunspots and giving off less energy. This is called a \"Grand Solar Minimum,\" and the last time this happened, it coincided with a period called the \"Little Ice Age\" (a period of extremely low solar activity from approximately AD 1650 to 1715 in the Northern Hemisphere, when a combination of cooling from volcanic aerosols and low solar activity produced lower surface temperatures). Anomalous periods like a Grand Solar Minimum show that magnetic activity and energy output from the Sun can vary over decades, although the space-based observations of the last 35 years have seen little change from one cycle to the next in terms of total irradiance. Solar Cycle 24, which began in December 2008 and is likely to end in 2020, was smaller in magnitude than the previous two cycles. On occasion, researchers have predicted that coming solar cycles may also exhibit extended periods of minimal activity. The models for such predictions, however, are still not as robust as models for our weather and are not considered conclusive. But if such a Grand Solar Minimum occurred, how big of an effect might it have? In terms of climate forcing – a factor that could push the climate in a particular direction – solar scientists estimate it would be about -0.1 W/m , the same impact of about three years of current carbon dioxide (CO ) concentration growth. Thus, a new Grand Solar Minimum would only serve to offset a few years of warming caused by human activities. What does this mean? The warming caused by the greenhouse gas emissions from the human burning of fossil fuels is than the possible decades-long cooling from a prolonged Grand Solar Minimum. Even if a Grand Solar Minimum were to last a century, global temperatures would continue to warm. The reason for this is because more factors than just variations in the Sun’s output change global temperatures on Earth, the most dominant of those today is the warming coming from human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. The Sun powers life on Earth; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. It also influences Earth’s climate: We know subtle changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the past ice ages. But the warming we’ve seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth’s orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity. The Sun doesn’t always shine at the same level of brightness; it brightens and dims slightly, taking approximately 11 years to complete one solar cycle. During each cycle, the Sun undergoes various changes in its activity and appearance. Levels of solar radiation go up or down, as does the amount of material the Sun ejects into space and the size and number of . These changes have a variety of effects in space, in Earth’s atmosphere and on Earth’s surface. The current solar cycle, Solar Cycle 24, began in December 2008 and is less active than the previous two. It’s expected to end sometime in 2020. Scientists don’t yet know with confidence how strong the next solar cycle may be. According to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the current scientific consensus is that long and short-term variations in solar activity play only a very small role in Earth’s climate. Warming from increased levels of human-produced greenhouse gases is actually many times stronger than any effects due to recent variations in solar activity. For more than 40 years, satellites have observed the Sun's energy output, which has gone up or down by less than 0.1 percent during that period. Since 1750, the warming driven by greenhouse gases coming from the human burning of fossil fuels is over 50 times greater than the slight extra warming coming from the Sun itself over that same time interval. As mentioned, the Sun is currently experiencing a lower level of sunspot activity. Some scientists speculate that this may be the beginning of a Grand Solar Minimum — a decades-to-centuries-long period of low solar activity — while others say there is insufficient evidence to support that position. During a grand minimum, solar magnetism diminishes, sunspots appear infrequently and less ultraviolet radiation reaches Earth. The largest recent event -- the “Maunder Minimum,” which lasted from 1645 and 1715 — overlapped with the “Little Ice Age” (13 to mid-19 century). While scientists continue to research whether an extended solar minimum could have contributed to cooling the climate, there is little evidence that the Maunder Minimum sparked the Little Ice Age, or at least not entirely by itself (notably, the Little Ice Age began the Maunder Minimum). Current theories on what caused the Little Ice Age consider that a variety of events could have contributed, with natural fluctuations in ocean circulation, changes in land use by humans and cooling from a less active sun also playing roles; overall, cooling caused by volcanic aerosols likely played the title role. Several studies in recent years have looked at the effects that another Grand Solar Minimum might have on global surface temperatures. These studies have suggested that while a grand minimum might cool the planet as much as 0.3 degrees C, this would, at best, slow down but not reverse human-caused global warming. There would be a small decline of energy reaching Earth; however, just three years of current carbon dioxide concentration growth would make up for it. In addition, the Grand Solar Minimum would be modest and temporary, with global temperatures quickly rebounding once the event concluded. Moreover, even a prolonged Grand Solar Minimum or Maunder Minimum would only briefly and minimally offset human-caused warming.

        "content": "10 min read NASA Science Editorial Team If you could ask a sea turtle why small increases in global average temperature matter, you’d be likely to get a mouthful. Of sea grass, that is. Of course, sea turtles can’t talk, except in certain animated movies. And while on-screen they’re portrayed as happy-go-lucky creatures, in reality it’s pretty tough to be a sea turtle, dude ( ), and in a warming world, it’s getting tougher. While the plight of sea turtles is illustrative, it’s a fact that all natural and human systems are sensitive to climate warming in varying degrees. To assess the likely impacts of global warming on our planet at various temperature thresholds above pre-industrial levels (considered to be the time period between 1850 and 1900), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in October released a Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 Degrees Celsius (2.7 Degrees Fahrenheit). The IPCC is the United Nations body tasked with assessing the science related to climate change. The report examined the impacts of limiting the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, and projected the impacts Earth is expected to see at both 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees Celsius warming above those levels. The 1.5-degree Celsius threshold represents the target goal established by the Paris Agreement, adopted by 195 nations in December 2015 to address the threat of climate change. Source: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5º Celsius (2.7º Fahrenheit) For a more detailed overview of selected highlights from the IPCC Special Report, see . The warmest extreme temperatures will be in Central and Eastern North America, Central and Southern Europe, the Mediterranean (including Southern Europe, Northern Africa and the near-East), as well as Western and Central Asia and Southern Africa. At 2 degrees Celsius warming, the deadly heatwaves India and Pakistan saw in 2015 may occur annually. People in river basins, especially in the Middle and Near East, will be particularly vulnerable. At 2 degrees Celsius warming, some places will see an increase in heavy rainfall events compared to at 1.5 degrees warming. This includes Eastern North America, which will see higher flooding risks. Other affected areas include the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes (Alaska/Western Canada, Eastern Canada/Greenland/Iceland, Northern Europe, Northern Asia) and Southeast Asia. At 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, 6 percent of the report's studied insects, 8 percent of plants and 4 percent of vertebrates will see their climatically determined geographic range reduced by more than half (map highlights areas where monarch butterfly populations are affected). At 2 degrees Celsius warming, those numbers jump to 18 percent, 16 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Warming of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius will lead to a reduction of rainforest biomass and will increase deforestation and wildfires. Trees at the southern boundaries of boreal forests will die. The IPCC Special Report states, with medium confidence, that at an increased level of warming between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius, instabilities in the Antarctic ice sheet and/or the irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet could lead to multi-meter (greater than 6 feet) sea level rise over a time scale of hundreds to thousands of years. Ocean oxygen levels will decrease, leading to more “dead zones” — areas where normal ocean waters are replaced by waters with low oxygen levels that won’t support most aquatic life. Ocean warming, acidification and more intense storms will cause coral reefs to decline by 70 to 90 percent at 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, becoming all but non-existent at 2 degrees warming. The risk of heat-related illness and death will be lower at 1.5 degrees Celsius warming than at 2 degrees. Cities will experience the worst impacts of heatwaves due to the urban heat island effect, which keeps them warmer than surrounding rural areas. Projected food availability will be less at 2 degrees Celsius warming than at 1.5 degrees in Southern Africa, the Mediterranean, the Sahel, Central Europe and the Amazon. In the United States, economic damages from climate change are projected to be large, with one 2017 study concluding the United States could lose 2.3 percent of its Gross Domestic Product for each degree Celsius increase in global warming. The report finds that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is expected to significantly reduce the probability of drought and risks related to water availability in some regions, particularly in the Mediterranean (including Southern Europe, Northern Africa and the Near-East), and in Southern Africa, South America and Australia. The report, prepared by 91 authors and review editors from 40 countries along with 133 contributing authors, cites more than 6,000 scientific references and includes contributions from thousands of expert reviewers around the world, including from NASA. NASA data were critical to enabling understanding of how each half degree of warming will impact our planet. NASA models contributed to the report’s projections, while NASA satellite with modern monitoring systems, many of which are from NASA, really lets us see what happens to the planet with an extra half a degree of warming much more clearly than in the past.” The report says that since the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased Earth’s global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a number that is currently increasing by 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) every decade. At that rate, global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels sometime between 2030 and 2052, with a best estimate of around 2040. Warming that’s already been introduced into the Earth system by human-produced emissions since the start of the pre-industrial period isn’t expected to dissipate for hundreds to thousands of years. That already “baked in” warming will continue to cause further long-term changes in our climate, such as sea level rise and its associated impacts. However, the report says that these past emissions alone are not considered likely, by themselves, to cause Earth to warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius. In other words, what we as a society do now matters. The urgency with which the world addresses greenhouse gas emission reductions now will help determine the degree of future warming; in essence, whether we’ll be hit by a climate change hardball or a wiffle ball. You might be thinking, “Why should I care if temperatures go up another half a degree or one degree? Temperatures go up and down all the time. What difference does it make?” The answer is, a lot. Higher temperature thresholds will adversely impact increasingly larger percentages of life on Earth, with significant variations by region, ecosystem and species. For some species, it literally means life or death. “What we see isn’t good – impacts of climate change are in many cases larger in response to a half a degree (of warming) than we’d expected,” said Shindell, who was formerly a research scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. “We see faster acceleration of ice melting, greater increases in tropical storm damages, stronger effects on droughts and flooding, etc. As we calibrate our models to capture the observed responses or even simply extrapolate another half a degree, we see that it’s more important than we’d previously thought to avoid the extra warming between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.” Shindell said the report was able to use scientists’ understanding from observations to assess how many more people would be at risk from the impacts of climate change with an additional half a degree of warming. “It’s hundreds of millions,” he said, “which makes clear the importance of keeping warming as low as possible.” , and its section, document what a 1-degree Celsius temperature increase has already done to our planet. The impacts of global warming are being felt everywhere, from rising sea levels to more extreme weather, more frequent wildfires, and heatwaves and increased drought, to name a few. Because our society has been built around the climate Earth has had for the past approximately 10,000 years, when it changes noticeably, as it has done in recent decades, people begin to take notice. Today, most people realize Earth’s climate is changing. A December 2018 report by Yale and George Mason Universities found that seven in 10 Americans think global warming is happening, with about six in 10 saying it is mostly caused by humans. We live in a world bound by the laws of physics. For example, at temperatures above 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), ice, including Earth’s polar ice sheets and other land ice, begins to melt and changes from a solid to a liquid. When that water flows downward into the ocean, it raises global sea level. Similarly, temperature plays a critical role in biology. We all know the average temperature of a healthy adult human is about 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). You don’t have to ask anyone running a fever of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit) if a couple of degrees matters. Our bodies are optimized to run at a certain temperature. According to most studies, humans feel most comfortable, are most productive and function best when the ambient temperature around us is roughly 22 degrees Celsius (71.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Vary that temperature by more than a few degrees in either direction and we seek to warm or cool ourselves if we can. Our bodies also make adjustments, such as sweating. When ambient temperatures become too extreme, the impacts on human health can be profound, even deadly. Plants and other animals have it tougher. While they also adjust to their external temperature environment through various mechanisms, they can’t just turn on an air conditioner or furnace like we can, and they may not be able to migrate. They survive within specific, defined habitats. For all living organisms, the faster climate changes, the more difficult it is to adapt to it. When climate change is too rapid, it can lead to species extinction. As greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase, the cumulative impact will be to accelerate temperature change. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius decreases the risks of long-lasting or irreversible changes, such as the loss of certain ecosystems, and allows people and ecosystems to better adapt. So just how may another half- or full-degree Celsius of warming affect our planet? In of our feature, we look at some of the IPCC special report’s specific projections. Hurricanes threaten North American coastlines every year, and they appear to be intensifying as climate changes. Similar storms can also hit colder regions to the far north, and new research suggests they will intensify, too. In findings published on Nov. 9, NASA scientists project spring Arctic cyclones will intensify by the end of this century […] One way that scientists monitor climate change is through the measure of sea ice extent. Sea ice extent is the area of ice that covers the Arctic Ocean at a given time. Sea ice plays an important role in reflecting sunlight back into space, regulating ocean and air temperature, circulating ocean water, and maintaining animal […] Ask your average resident of California, Oregon or Washington to name the natural hazard that concerns them most and sea level rise probably won’t bubble to the top of the list. After all, the region is better known for its wildfires, earthquakes, heat waves, and mudslides. But those who live along the coastline know better.

        "content": "9 min read NASA Science Editorial Team Ensuring the accuracy of Earth’s long-term global and regional surface temperature records is a challenging, constantly evolving undertaking. There are lots of reasons for this, including changes in the availability of data, technological advancements in how land and sea surface temperatures are measured, the growth of urban areas, and changes to where and when temperature data are collected, to name just a few. Over time, these changes can lead to measurement inconsistencies that affect temperature data records. Scientists have been building estimates of Earth’s average global temperature for more than a century, using temperature records from weather stations. But before 1880, there just wasn’t enough data to make accurate calculations, resulting in uncertainties in these older records. Fortunately, consistent temperature estimates made by paleoclimatologists (scientists who study Earth’s past climate using environmental clues like ice cores and tree rings) provide scientists with context for understanding today’s observed warming of Earth’s climate, which has no historic parallel. Over the past 140 years, we’ve literally gone from making some temperature measurements by hand to using sophisticated satellite technology. Today’s temperature data come from many sources, including more than 32,000 land weather stations, weather balloons, radar, ships and buoys, satellites, and volunteer weather watchers. To account for all of these changes and ensure a consistent, accurate record of our planet’s temperature variations, scientists use information from many sources to make adjustments before incorporating and absorbing temperature data into analyses of regional or global surface temperatures. This allows them to make “apples to apples” comparisons. Let’s look more closely at why these adjustments are made. To begin with, some temperature data are gathered by humans. As all of us know, humans can make occasional mistakes in recording and transcribing observations. So, a first step in processing temperature data is to perform quality control to identify and eliminate any erroneous data caused by such errors – things like missing a minus sign, misreading an instrument, etc. Next are changes to land weather stations. Temperature readings at weather stations can be affected by the physical location of the station, by what’s happening around it, and even by the time of day that readings are made. For example, if a weather station is located at the bottom of a mountain and a new station is built on the same mountain but at a higher location, the changes in latitude and elevation could affect the station’s readings. If you simply averaged the old and new data sets, the station’s overall temperature readings would be lower beginning when the new station opens. Similarly, if a station is moved away from a city center to a less developed location like an airport, cooler readings may result, while if the land around a weather station becomes more developed, readings might get warmer. Such differences are caused by how ground surfaces in different environments absorb and retain heat. Then there are changes to the way that stations collect temperature data. Old technologies become outdated or instrumentation simply wears out and is replaced. Using new equipment with slightly different characteristics can affect temperature measurements. Data adjustments may also be required if there are changes to the time of day that observations are made. If, for example, a network of weather stations adopts a uniform observation time, as they did in the United States, stations making such a switch will see their data affected, because temperature is dependent on time of day. Scientists also make adjustments to account for station temperature data that are significantly higher or lower than that of nearby stations. Such out-of-the-ordinary temperature readings typically have absolutely nothing to do with climate change but are instead due to some human-produced change that causes the station readings to be out of line with neighboring stations. By comparing data with surrounding stations, scientists can identify abnormal station measurements and ensure that they don’t skew overall regional or global temperature estimates. In addition, since the number of land weather stations is increasing over time, forming more dense networks that increase the accuracy of temperature estimates in those regions, scientists also take those improvements into account so data from areas with dense networks can be appropriately compared with data from areas with less dense networks. Much like the trends on land, sea surface temperature measurement practices have also changed significantly. Before about 1940, the most common method for measuring sea surface temperature was to throw a bucket attached to a rope overboard from a ship, haul it back up, and read the water temperature. The method was far from perfect. Depending on the air temperature, the water temperature could change as the bucket was pulled from the water. During the 1930s and ‘40s, scientists began measuring the temperature of ocean water piped in to cool ship engines. This method was more accurate. The impact on long-term ocean surface temperature records was to reduce the warming trend in global ocean temperatures that had been observed before that time. That’s because temperature readings from water drawn up in buckets prior to measurement are, on average, a few tenths of a degree Celsius cooler than readings of water obtained at the level of the ocean in a ship’s intake valves. Then, beginning around 1990, measurements from thousands of floating buoys began replacing ship-based measurements as the commonly accepted standard. Today, such buoys provide about 80% of ocean temperature data. Temperatures recorded by buoys are slightly lower than those obtained from ship engine room water intakes for two reasons. First, buoys sample water that is slightly deeper, and therefore cooler, than water samples obtained from ships. Second, the process of passing water samples through a ship’s inlet can slightly heat the water. To compensate for the addition of cooler water temperature data from buoys to the warmer temperature data obtained from ships, ocean temperatures from buoys in recent years have been adjusted slightly upward to be consistent with ship measurements. Currently, there are multiple independent climate research organizations around the world that maintain long-term data sets of global land and ocean temperatures. Among the best known are those produced by NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.K. Meteorological Office's Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, and Berkeley Earth, a California-based non-profit. Each organization uses different techniques to make its estimates and adjusts its input data sets to compensate for changes in observing conditions, using data processing methods described in peer-reviewed literature. Remarkably, despite the differences in methodologies used by these independent researchers, their global temperature estimates are all in close agreement. Moreover, they also match up closely to independent data sets derived from satellites and weather forecast models. One of the leading data sets used to conduct global surface temperature analyses is the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) surface temperature analysis, known as GISTEMP. GISTEMP uses a statistical method that produces a consistent estimated temperature anomaly series from 1880 to the present. A “temperature anomaly” is a calculation of how much colder or warmer a measured temperature is at a given weather station compared to an average value for that location and time, which is calculated over a 30-year reference period (1951-1980). The current version of GISTEMP includes adjusted average monthly data from the latest version of the NOAA/National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Global Historical Climatology Network analysis and its Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature data. GISTEMP uses an automated process to flag abnormal records that don’t appear to be accurate. Scientists then perform manual inspections on the suspect data. GISTEMP also adjusts to account for the effects of , which are differences in temperatures between urban and rural areas. The procedure used to calculate GISTEMP hasn’t changed significantly since the mid-1980s, except to better account for data from urban areas. While the growing availability of better data has led to adjustments in GISTEMP’s regional temperature averages, the adjustments While raw data from an individual station are never adjusted, any station showing abnormal data resulting from changes in measurement method, its immediate surroundings, or apparent errors, is compared to reference data from neighboring stations that have similar climate conditions in order to identify and remove abnormal data before they are input into the GISTEMP method. While such data adjustments can substantially impact some individual stations and small regions, In addition, results from global climate models are not used at any stage in the GISTEMP process, so comparisons between GISTEMP and model projections are valid. All data used by GISTEMP are in the public domain, and all code used is available for independent verification. Independent analyses conclude the impact of station temperature data adjustments is not very large. Upward adjustments of global temperature readings before 1950 have, in total, slightly century-scale global temperature trends. Since 1950, however, adjustments to input data have slightly increased the rate of global warming recorded by the temperature record by less than 0.1 degree Celsius (less than 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit). A final note: while adjustments are applied to station temperature data being used in global analyses, the raw data from these stations never changes unless better archived data become available. When global temperature data are processed, the original records are preserved and are available to anyone who wants them, at no cost, online. For example, the NOAA National Climatic Data Center's U.S. and global records may be accessed . The information will help people who live in coastal areas prepare for impacts caused by rising sea levels. Earth’s ocean is rising, disrupting livelihoods and infrastructure in coastal communities around the world. Agencies and organizations are working to prepare people as their world changes around them, and NASA information is helping these efforts.

For every 1,000 sea turtle eggs laid, only about one turtle reaches adulthood due to natural predators and other obstacles. Those that do make it face numerous threats from humans. For example, they’re hunted in some regions for their meat, eggs and shells. Their beach habitats get developed. Harmful marine debris and oil spills pollute their waters and beaches. Now, climate change is exposing sea turtles to even greater existential threats. Sea level rise and stronger storms will erode and destroy their beach habitats. Warming oceans will change ocean currents, potentially introducing sea turtles to new predators and harming the coral reefs some of them need to survive. Since the temperature of the beach sand that female sea turtles nest in influences the sex of their offspring during incubation, our warming climate may be driving sea turtles into extinction by creating a shortage of males, according to several studies.

        "content": "NASA isn't all about interplanetary exploration; in fact, the agency spends much of its time studying our home planet. This fun whiteboard animation series explains Earth science to the science-curious. Earth is a complex, dynamic system we do not fully understand. To learn more about it, NASA, as the agency with access to space, was tasked with launching the first weather satellite back in 1960. Today, NASA uses satellites, aircraft and even an occasional boat to study our planet's air, land and water. It's called \"Earth system science\" and we are trying to answer some big questions: How is the global Earth system changing? What causes these changes? How will Earth change in the future? And what we learn benefits society through applications such as weather forecasting, freshwater availability and disaster response. Aerosols are minute solid and liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere. Examples include desert dust, sea salt from ocean spray, volcanic ash, smoke from wildfires and emissions from the burning of coal and oil. These tiny particles affect weather and climate, cause hazy skies and can pose serious health hazards. Aerosols also can act as sites for chemical reactions, such as those that lead to the destruction of stratospheric ozone, i.e., the ozone hole. Clouds are complicated when it comes to climate science, as they both warm and cool Earth. NASA is studying these atmospheric masses of condensed water vapor with satellites and aircraft, and you can, too, with a citizen science app: . Located in the Arctic near the North Pole, the island of Greenland is covered by a massive ice sheet three times the size of Texas and a mile deep on average. Greenland is warming almost twice as fast as Antarctica, which is causing the ice to melt and raise global sea levels. NASA is monitoring Greenland’s ice sheet from space to the ocean floor to provide data for scientists studying the global impact of all this melting ice. For over 20 years NASA has been tracking the ocean's global surface topography to understand the important role it plays in our lives. Climate change is causing our ocean to warm and glaciers to melt, resulting in sea level rise. Since 1880, the global sea level has risen 8 inches; by 2100, it is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet. NASA doesn’t study just the stars and planets; it is also concerned about the soil beneath your feet. Studying the moisture in the top two inches of the soil from space with a satellite named \"SMAP\" can help weather forecasters predict flash floods, farmers grow more crops and communities plan for drought. Since 1978, NASA has been monitoring ocean winds via scatterometry, the data of which have improved weather and hurricane forecasts and helped us better understand global climate patterns. Knowing which way the wind is blowing over water is critical for industries such as shipping and fishing, and it helps predict unusual weather phenomena such as El Niño. The force of gravity not only keeps us from floating away, it also lets NASA study Earth’s water and ice from space. Using a pair of twin satellites named \"GRACE,\" we can monitor where our planet’s water is going, even when it is underground. Greenhouse gases are vital to life on Earth, but the growing concentration of certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, is throwing the planet's delicate balance out of whack. NASA is on the case, studying carbon dioxide on a global scale and its effects on our weather and climate. Earth's average temperature has risen over 1º F in the past century. It is projected to rise an additional 3º to 10º over the next 100 years. Data from NASA's global network of satellites, airborne missions and surface-monitoring systems is used to build climate models that help us understand the causes and effects of global warming. Before the Industrial Revolution, Earth’s climate changed due to natural events such as volcanic activity and solar energy variations. These natural events still contribute to climate change today, but their impact is very small compared to the growing levels of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere by humans burning fossil fuels. NASA’s ongoing Earth science missions, research and computer models help us better understand the long-term global changes occurring today through both natural and manmade causes. NASA doesn't explore just outer space! Since 1959, with the launch of the first weather satellite, NASA has been studying our home planet on a global scale. It monitors Earth's vital signs via satellites and airplanes, sends scientists to the far corners of the land and under the ocean, and develops computer models of Earth's climate processes. Why? Because Earth is the only planet that nearly eight billion people call \"home sweet home.\" NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery."

Milankovitch cycles include the shape of Earth’s orbit (its eccentricity), the angle that Earth’s axis is tilted with respect to Earth’s orbital plane (its obliquity), and the direction that Earth’s spin axis is pointed (its precession). These cycles affect the amount of sunlight and therefore, energy, that Earth absorbs from the Sun. They provide a strong framework for understanding changes in Earth’s climate, including the beginning and end of Ice Ages throughout Earth’s history. (You can learn more about Milankovitch cycles and the roles they play in Earth’s climate ). But Milankovitch cycles can’t explain all climate change that’s occurred over the past 2.5 million years or so. And more importantly, So how do we know Milankovitch cycles aren’t to blame? Even for Ice Age cycles, changes in the extent of ice sheets and atmospheric carbon dioxide have played important roles in driving the degree of temperature fluctuations over the last several million years. The extent of ice sheets, for example, affects how much of the Sun’s incoming energy is reflected back to space, and in turn, Earth’s temperature. Then there’s carbon dioxide. During past glacial cycles, the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere fluctuated from about 180 parts per million (ppm) to 280 ppm as part of Milankovitch cycle-driven changes to Earth’s climate. These fluctuations provided an important feedback to the total change in Earth’s climate that took place during those cycles. Today, however, it’s the direct input of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels that’s responsible for changing Earth’s atmospheric composition over the last century, rather than climate feedbacks from the ocean or land caused by Milankovitch cycles. Since the beginning of the Industrial Age, the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere has increased 50 percent, from about 280 ppm to 412 ppm (update: 421 ppm in 2023). Scientists know with a high degree of certainty this carbon dioxide is primarily due to human activities because carbon produced by burning fossil fuels leaves a distinct “fingerprint” that instruments can measure. Since 1850, Earth’s global average temperature has increased by over 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit). Furthermore, recent scientific assessments show that Earth is expected to warm another half a degree Celsius (almost a degree Fahrenheit) as soon as 2030. This relatively rapid warming of our climate due to human activities is happening in addition to the very slow changes to climate caused by Milankovitch cycles. Climate models indicate any forcing of Earth’s climate due to Milankovitch cycles is overwhelmed when human activities cause the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere to exceed about 350 ppm. Scientists know of no natural changes to the equilibrium between the amount of solar radiation absorbed by Earth and the amount of energy radiated back to space that can account for such a rapid period of global warming. The amount of incoming solar radiation has increased only slightly over the past century and is therefore not a driver of Earth’s current climate warming. Since 1750, the warming driven by greenhouse gases coming from the human burning of fossil fuels is over 50 times greater than the slight extra warming coming from the Sun itself over that same time interval. If Earth’s current warming was due to the Sun, scientists say we should expect temperatures in both the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and the next layer of the atmosphere, the stratosphere, to warm. Instead, observations from balloons and satellites show Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere have warmed but the stratosphere has cooled. There’s nothing cool about that. On a changing planet, where phenomena like severe hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires are becoming more severe, scientists need data to assess and model disaster impacts and to potentially make predictions about hazards. NASA’s C-20A aircraft is a significant asset that can carry key instruments for understanding the science behind these phenomena.

        "content": "8 min read NASA Science Editorial Team Our lives literally revolve around cycles: series of events that are repeated regularly in the same order. There are hundreds of different types of cycles in our world and in the universe. Some are natural, such as the change of the seasons, annual animal migrations or the circadian rhythms that govern our sleep patterns. Others are human-produced, like growing and harvesting crops, musical rhythms or economic cycles. Cycles also play key roles in Earth’s short-term weather and long-term climate. A century ago, Serbian scientist Milutin Milankovitch hypothesized the long-term, collective effects of changes in Earth’s position relative to the Sun are a strong driver of Earth’s climate, and are responsible for triggering the beginning and end of glaciation periods (Ice Ages). Specifically, he examined how variations in three types of Earth orbital movements affect how much solar radiation (known as insolation) reaches the top of Earth’s atmosphere as well as where the insolation reaches. These cyclical orbital movements, which became known as the Milankovitch cycles, cause variations of up to 25 percent in the amount of incoming insolation at Earth’s mid-latitudes (the areas of our planet located between about 30 and 60 degrees north and south of the equator). The Milankovitch cycles include: Let’s take a look at each . – Earth’s annual pilgrimage around the Sun isn’t perfectly circular, but it’s pretty close. Over time, the pull of gravity from our solar system’s two largest gas giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, causes the shape of Earth’s orbit to vary from nearly circular to slightly elliptical. Eccentricity measures how much the shape of Earth’s orbit departs from a perfect circle. These variations affect the distance between Earth and the Sun. Eccentricity is the reason why our seasons are slightly different lengths, with summers in the Northern Hemisphere currently about 4.5 days longer than winters, and springs about three days longer than autumns. As eccentricity decreases, the length of our seasons gradually evens out. The difference in the distance between Earth’s closest approach to the Sun (known as perihelion), which occurs on or about January 3 each year, and its farthest departure from the Sun (known as aphelion) on or about July 4, is currently about 5.1 million kilometers (about 3.2 million miles), a variation of 3.4 percent. That means each January, about 6.8 percent more incoming solar radiation reaches Earth than it does each July. When Earth’s orbit is at its most elliptic, about 23 percent more incoming solar radiation reaches Earth at our planet’s closest approach to the Sun each year than does at its farthest departure from the Sun. The total change in global annual insolation due to the eccentricity cycle is very small. Because variations in Earth’s eccentricity are fairly small, they’re a relatively minor factor in annual seasonal climate variations. – The angle Earth’s axis of rotation is tilted as it travels around the Sun is known as obliquity. Obliquity is why Earth has seasons. Over the last million years, it has varied between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees with respect to Earth’s orbital plane. The greater Earth’s axial tilt angle, the more extreme our seasons are, as each hemisphere receives more solar radiation during its summer, when the hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and less during winter, when it is tilted away. Larger tilt angles favor periods of deglaciation (the melting and retreat of glaciers and ice sheets). These effects aren’t uniform globally -- higher latitudes receive a larger change in total solar radiation than areas closer to the equator. It was last at its maximum tilt about 10,000 years ago and will reach its minimum tilt about 10,000 years from now. As obliquity decreases, it gradually helps make our seasons milder, resulting in increasingly warmer winters, and cooler summers that gradually, over time, allow snow and ice at high latitudes to build up into large ice sheets. As ice cover increases, it reflects more of the Sun’s energy back into space, promoting even further cooling. – As Earth rotates, it wobbles slightly upon its rotational axis, like a slightly off-center spinning toy top. This wobble is due to tidal forces caused by the gravitational influences of the Sun and Moon that cause Earth to bulge at the equator, affecting its rotation. The trend in the direction of this wobble relative to the fixed positions of stars is known as . The cycle of axial precession spans about 25,771.5 years. Axial precession makes seasonal contrasts more extreme in one hemisphere and less extreme in the other. Currently perihelion occurs during winter in the Northern Hemisphere and in summer in the Southern Hemisphere. This makes Southern Hemisphere summers hotter and moderates Northern Hemisphere seasonal variations. But in about 13,000 years, axial precession will cause these conditions to flip, with the Northern Hemisphere seeing more extremes in solar radiation and the Southern Hemisphere experiencing more moderate seasonal variations. Precession does affect seasonal timing relative to Earth's closest/farthest points around the Sun. However, the modern calendar system ties itself to the seasons, and so, for example, the Northern Hemisphere winter will never occur in July. Today Earth’s North Stars are Polaris and Polaris Australis, but a couple of thousand years ago, they were Kochab and Pherkad. There’s also . Not only does Earth wobble on its rotational axis, but Earth’s entire orbital ellipse – that is, the oval-shaped path Earth follows in its orbit around the Sun — also wobbles irregularly, primarily due to its interactions with Jupiter and Saturn. The cycle of apsidal precession spans about 112,000 years. Apsidal precession changes the orientation of Earth’s orbit relative to the ecliptic plane. The combined effects of axial and apsidal precession result in an overall precession cycle spanning about 23,000 years on average. The small changes set in motion by Milankovitch cycles operate separately and together to influence Earth’s climate over very long timespans, leading to larger changes in our climate over tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Milankovitch combined the cycles to create a comprehensive mathematical model for calculating differences in solar radiation at various Earth latitudes along with corresponding surface temperatures. The model is sort of like a : it can be run backward and forward to examine past and future climate conditions. Milankovitch assumed changes in radiation at some latitudes and in some seasons are more important than others to the growth and retreat of ice sheets. In addition, it was his belief that obliquity was the most important of the three cycles for climate, because it affects the amount of insolation in Earth’s northern high-latitude regions during summer (the relative role of precession versus obliquity is still a matter of scientific study). He calculated that Ice Ages occur approximately every 41,000 years. Subsequent research confirms that they did occur at 41,000-year intervals between one and three million years ago. But about 800,000 years ago, the cycle of Ice Ages lengthened to 100,000 years, matching Earth’s eccentricity cycle. While various theories have been proposed to explain this transition, scientists do not yet have a clear answer. Milankovitch’s work was supported by other researchers of his time, and he authored numerous publications on his hypothesis. But it wasn’t until about 10 years after his death in 1958 that the global science community began to take serious notice of his theory. In 1976, a study in the journal Science by Hays et al. using deep-sea sediment cores found that Milankovitch cycles correspond with periods of major climate change over the past 450,000 years, with Ice Ages occurring when Earth was undergoing different stages of orbital variation. Several other projects and studies have also upheld the validity of Milankovitch’s work, including research using data from ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica that has provided strong evidence of Milankovitch cycles going back many hundreds of thousands of years. In addition, his work has been embraced by the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Scientific research to better understand the mechanisms that cause changes in Earth’s rotation and how specifically Milankovitch cycles combine to affect climate is ongoing. But the theory that they drive the timing of glacial-interglacial cycles is well accepted. On a changing planet, where phenomena like severe hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires are becoming more severe, scientists need data to assess and model disaster impacts and to potentially make predictions about hazards. NASA’s C-20A aircraft is a significant asset that can carry key instruments for understanding the science behind these phenomena.

The aims to bring EU legislation in line with the 2030 goal. The impacts of the 2022 gas and energy security crisis highlighted the importance of transitioning faster towards a clean and secure EU energy system. Under the wider umbrella of the European Green Deal, Europe's 2030 policy ambitions include: To accelerate this transition, Europe must ensure that investments and finance support sustainability. Energy and mobility sectors especially must distance themselves from unsustainable technologies. 6% of global emissions are released by the EU 37% reduction in EU emissions achieved in 2023 compared to 1990 levels 55% is the EU reduction target by 2030 compared to 1990 levels Total net greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union , marking significant progress towards climate neutrality for the EU.

        "content": "All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. The ozone layer sits in the stratosphere between 15 km and 30 km above the earth and shields us and other living things from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. Ozone layer depletion could have serious effects on human health and the environment. occurs over both hemispheres of the Earth. However, this phenomenon is more pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere (Antarctica) than in the Northern Hemisphere (Arctic). This is the case because the formation of the ozone hole is directly linked to the stratosphere's temperature. Once temperatures drop below -78°C, polar stratospheric clouds tend to form, which exacerbate ozone depletion. In the Antarctic, long presence of low is stimulating their formation, whereas the Arctic is characterised by larger year-to-year meteorological variability. Dobson Units (DU) measure how much ozone is in the air above us. On a global scale, the average total ozone concentration is typically around 300 DU. Ozone levels tend to be higher near the poles and lower at the equator. Generally, the ozone hole is defined as the area for which ozone column values amount to 220 Dobson Units (DU, marked by the thick contour line in Figure 1) or less (represented in blue colours in Figure 1). This is only apparent in the southern hemisphere. Here, the largest historical extent of the ozone hole — 28.4 million square kilometres (Figure 1) — occurred in September 2000. This area is equivalent to almost seven times the territory of the EU. Please select a resource that has a preview image available. This year's ozone hole over the Southern Hemisphere had a maximum area of 21.9 million km² at the end of September (Figure 2), making it the smallest ozone hole since 2020. Data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) already indicated an unusually large and persistent ozone hole over the Antarctic in the period from 2020 to 2022 for which the drivers are currently still subject to research. While UNEP's scientific assessment report projects that global stratospheric ozone will return to 1980 levels around 2040, the behaviour of the southern ozone layer contrasts with observations in the past 40 years. Nonetheless, CAMS researchers expect to see a full recovery of the ozone hole by mid-century. Please select a resource that has a preview image available. When it comes to the identification of drivers of ozone depletion, the complex interaction of chemical and meteorological factors makes it difficult to attribute ozone hole evolution to a single individual component. One aspect is the strength of the polar vortex. For instance, the strength of the polar vortex in 2021 exceeded all other years which resulted in a large ozone hole. In late 2023, the ozone hole was unusually persistent during November, remaining over 14.2m2, roughly the area of Antarctica, until early December, closing on 20 December 2023 being the third longest-lived ozone hole, after the years 1999 and 2020 closing 27 December. In 2024, a highly disrupted southern polar vortex during austral winter contributed to late depletion of ozone starting in late August. Under normal meteorological conditions the hole begins to form in mid to late August and closes towards the end of November. Overall, the evolution of the 2024 ozone hole appears to be like the one in 2022. Another facet which acts as a driver to the ozone hole’s size is stratospheric temperature, with warmer temperatures leading to a smaller ozone hole, such as in 2019 and 2024 (CAMS, 2024 - see the list of scientific references). Two episodes of sudden stratospheric warming in July 2024 added to the above-mentioned phenomenon. When the polar vortex is weak, with higher temperatures and slower winds than usual in the stratosphere, ozone depletion process is weaker, leading to ozone columns above 220 Dobson units (DU). Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) cannot directly be attributed to a larger ozone hole, as they exert a dual effect. While GHGs are thought to lead to warmer temperatures, they tend to have a cooling effect in the middle and upper stratosphere which reduces the temperature exchange between the different layers of Earth's atmosphere. This stratospheric cooling effect is generally positively associated with ozone recovery, except for the polar regions. Here, very low temperatures can lead to an increase in the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, which facilitate ozone depletion as explained above. The ozone hole can also be periodically influenced by volcanic eruptions and forest wildfires, perturbing chemical and dynamic processes which in return affect stratospheric ozone amounts. the eruption of the Hunga Tonga - Hunga Ha’apai volcano in early 2022, that injected huge amounts of water vapour into the stratosphere, might also have influenced the extent and intensity of ozone depletion in 2023. Finally, smoke-charged vortex (SCV) resulting from wildfires transport aerosols into the stratosphere, and this leads to both depleting and increasing the ozone layer stemming from different chemical reactions at different atmospheric layers, depletion being the bigger part (Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, 2024 - see the list of scientific references). With the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires driven by global warming, the formation of SCVs and their impact on the stratosphere could become more common, posing a threat to the ozone layer. The new findings by researchers of the Max Planck Institute highlight that natural events, exacerbated by climate change, pose additional risks to this fragile stratospheric layer. Since current observations show that the size and persistence of the ozone hole are largely dynamically driven, the urgence of continuing global efforts under the Montreal Protocol to ensure a swift recovery of the ozone layer and mitigating climate change remain key.

Some sources are widespread, like transport and agriculture, whereas others are linked to a specific place, like a factory or power plant. Chemicals, dust, noise and radiation are pollutants that can alter air, water and soil in a way that makes them harmful to our health and environment.

In addition, the presence of accessible, high-quality green spaces in cities supports physical and mental health and social well-being.

Ageing populations, increasing affluence and changing climate are expected to change demands for buildings’ particular uses in Europe, the EEA report notes. More buildings are likely to be needed in cities, and buildings need to contribute to environment and climate solutions, including energy saving and production, protection from climate hazards, and restoring nature. The EEA report ‘ ’ highlights the to adapt European cities to climate change and provides an they are taking. As European cities increasingly feel the , such as heatwaves and floods, there is a clear case for , the EEA report states. Cities have an essential role in the implementation of adaptation actions. European cities are adapting to climate change through a wide range of , including urban planning and building codes, economic incentives and insurance, early-warning systems and information campaigns. Emerging for adaptation include promoting urban agriculture, creating more liveable public spaces and protecting cultural heritage. They are also increasingly implementing , which are included in 91% of local adaptation plans analysed in the report. Europe is a highly urbanised continent. The urban landscape of Europe is heterogenous and characterised by a diversity of mostly small and medium cities. Despite this diversity, it is clear that cities will need to play a key role in achieving sustainability in Europe. With the support of urban stakeholders, the EEA developed a conceptual model and selected to assess the role of cities in urban transitions towards environmental sustainability, within the broad European Green Deal framework and the EU Urban Agenda. Cities have an outsized environmental impact, both positive and negative. On the one hand, urban sprawl encroaches on natural habitats and generates large amounts of pollution. On the other hand, resource use is typically more efficient and large-scale infrastructure projects can result in a lower environmental impact per person. As such, the importance of effective urban planning is hard to overstate. Every decision about how we use the land in urban spaces can either improve peoples’ lives and reduce our impact on the environment or have precisely the opposite effect. The suite of products gives users access to detailed land cover/land use maps for 788 Functional Urban Areas across Europe, as well as additional street tree maps, building block height measurements, and population estimates. These products provide information necessary for urban planners to make informed, data-driven decisions about things like green spaces, transportation networks, and emergency response plans. In cities, the ground is often covered by asphalt, pavement and buildings, which . The temperature is higher and that becomes dangerous for health. This is the urban heat island effect. Increasingly frequent, long and intense in combination with an and growing mean that more vulnerable populations are exposed to high temperatures, particularly in southern and central Europe. Reducing the health impacts of heat requires implementing a wide range of solutions, including effective , creating more green and shaded areas in cities, appropriate building design and construction, and adjusting working times and conditions so people are less exposed.

        "content": "All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. EU environment and climate policies have delivered substantial benefits over recent decades, such as cleaner air and water. Nevertheless, Europe, as well as the rest of the globe, is facing environmental challenges of unprecedented scale and urgency. Europe faces in areas such as biodiversity loss, resource use, climate change impacts and environmental risks to health and well-being. The continent continues to and contribute more to environmental degradation than other world regions. Policy measures targeted at nature protection have delivered , but many problems persist and some are getting worse. For example, reduced pollution has improved , but only achieved ‘good’ or ‘high’ a measure of aquatic ecosystem health, under EU’s Water Framework Directive and only 29% achieved ‘good’ over the 2015-2021 period, according to data reported by EU Member States. Land management has improved, but l continues to increase, damaging habitats and biodiversity. 75% of Europe’s ecosystem area is exposed to levels, causing eutrophication. The impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems are expected to intensify, while activities such as agriculture, fisheries, transport, industry and energy production continue to cause biodiversity loss, resource extraction and harmful emissions. Although good progress has been made towards from industry, transport and households — reducing the number of deaths linked to air pollution as a result, over 10% of annual in the EU are related to environmental pollution. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that citizens’ health is being by hazardous chemicals. The suggests that the current rate of progress will to meet 2030 and 2050 . Europe has made progress in relation to resource efficiency and the . has remained relatively stable and as the gross domestic product has increased. Total EU water abstraction . As set in the , Europe is committed to becoming a climate-neutral continent by 2050. Faced with the sustainability challenges above, achieving sustainability requires a complete transformation of key systems — the way we produce our food, we produce and consume goods, we move and build our cities, while boosting nature’s resilience and preparing for the impacts of climate change. Europe has achieved some progress towards its environmental targets, but more efforts are needed to reach climate neutrality and zero pollution targets for 2050. Habitats and species are under immense pressure. Europe is the continent with the most ambitious climate and environmental policies, gathered under the EU’s European Green Deal umbrella. The European Green Deal is set to transform the EU into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy, ensuring: European Green Deal priorities include: By working on these key areas, the EU will improve the health and quality of life of citizens, address environmental problems and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. we publish our flagship report: ). The sixth SOER identified serious gaps between the state of the environment and existing EU near‑ and long‑term policy targets. While European environment and climate policies have helped to improve the environment over recent decades, Europe is not making enough progress and the outlook for the environment in the coming decade is not positive, according to the ‘ (SOER 2020)’ report. According to the largest assessment on the health of Europe’s water bodies, published by the EEA, Europe is not on track to meet its targets to improve the health of waters under EU rules. Better water management is key to improve water resilience, to alleviate pressures on water and to ensure European citizens, nature and industry have enough good-quality water. is the impacting both surface and groundwaters, according to the EEA report ‘ ’. This results from water use and pollution from the intensive use of nutrients and pesticides, according to Member States’ own monitoring. Agriculture is by far the highest net water consumer in Europe and, without changes in practices, demand from irrigated agriculture is likely to increase with climate change. protected areas of land covered by protected areas habitats protected under EU law of Europe's seas covered by protected areas species and habitats protected under EU law Soil degradation threatens our competitiveness, food security, agricultural productivity, biodiversity, and resilience to extreme weather events and climate change. Joint efforts at EU, national, and local level focus on restoring soil health. Launched at the EU Soil Observatory Stakeholder Forum, the report assesses the state of soil degradation across the EU and other countries in the European Economic Area, including Ukraine, Türkiye, and the Western Balkans. The report shows alarming status and trends, with soil degradation getting much worse in recent years, and highlights the need for immediate action to reverse this trend. The State of Soils in Europe report is a collaboration between the and the . The is a cornerstone of the EU’s ambitions to improve the well-being and health of citizens and future generations under the . It sets out the vision that by 2050, the EU should have reduced pollution to the extent that it no longer harms human health and natural ecosystems. This is translated into key 2030 to reduce pollution at source. We produced our first zero pollution monitoring assessment to assess progress towards these targets. Good progress has been made towards from industry, transport and homes — reducing the number of premature deaths linked to air pollution as a result. At the same time, Europe has been maintaining and improving its bathing and drinking and reducing the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Encouraging trends are also taking place in r , although the resulting positive impact on the environment is yet to be seen. The EU (EAP) builds on the European Green Deal and sets the framework for EU environmental policy until 2030. The European Environment Agency’s (EEA) first monitoring report on the Programme shows that the EU may not meet most of the monitoring targets outlined in the European Commission’s 8th EAP Monitoring Communication. The report takes stock of progress towards Europe’s key environment and climate goals, based on 28 indicators and monitoring targets. According to the EEA analysis, the EU may not meet the majority of the targets by 2030. The situation looks particularly challenging when it comes to the 8 EAP priority objective of reducing environmental and climate pressures related to production and consumption. This includes targets on energy consumption, rate of circular material use, and share of area under organic farming, which all look very unlikely to be achieved by 2030."

There is no “silver bullet”, no one-size-fits-all solution, when it comes to sustainability transitions. For a , for example, the introduction of the electric motor is not enough. New electric cars would still imply substantial . The fundamental issue is not how to create a more sustainable car, but rather for point to-point mobility and for social interaction and access to goods and services: from car-sharing schemes, driverless cars and a shift to alternative modes of transport (e.g. walking, cycling) to improved spatial planning and novel communication technologies that can reduce the need for mobility (e.g. teleworking) The European Union and its Member States are at the forefront of proposing and implementing sustainability solutions, be it by government initiatives or by grass-root movements: By embracing sustainability transitions, demonstrating solutions and seizing related opportunities, Europe can lead the global effort for change. The European Union is committed to using innovation to achieve a sustainable economy and becoming the first climate neutral continent, by 2050. The announced by the Commission is one of the world's largest funding programmes (up to EUR 38 billion) for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies and will contribute to greenhouse gas reduction. In the EU, polluters have to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions via the Emissions Trading System (ETS). The money raised via the ETS is reinvested into the Innovation Fund. is the EU’s key funding programme for research and innovation with a budget of EUR 95.5 billion. It tackles climate change, helps to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and boosts the EU’s competitiveness and growth. These initiatives are framed within the and are complemented by a wide set of policies and measures, including on zero pollution, food, mobility, energy and circular economy. How can Europe stay the course on sustainability amid shocks and crises? How do we anchor environment and climate priorities with other emerging ones like security, competitiveness and fairness without losing sight of the long-term sustainability objective of ‘living well within the limits of our planet’? Our new strategic foresight report calls for the need to further align European economic, social and security policies with the climate and environmental objectives. Failing to do so would put the coherence of EU’s strategic agenda at risk, hamper implementation of crucial climate, environment, and sustainability objectives, and reduce Europe’s ability to deal with ongoing multiple shocks and crises. The ‘ ’ report highlights the need to take a broader view on such priorities as . It recognises that Europe’s socio-economic systems and wellbeing of its citizens depend crucially on a healthy and resilient natural environment, a stable climate and long-term sustainable use of resources. Global pandemic, war, inflation and other shocks and crises have tested the European Green Deal and its ambition of building a climate-neutral and sustainable economy. Two new EEA reports discuss how Europe can respond to the pressing and complex societal challenges while moving towards long-term sustainability goals. The ‘ ’ explores the emerging concept of transformative resilience and how it can be useful for anticipating and responding to shocks while speeding up positive change in key areas of energy, circular economy and just transition. The — ’ discusses how many interconnected crises challenge traditional models of problem-solving and decision-making. The report points out that is still mixed. The EEA report ‘Just sustainability transitions – From concept to practice’ addresses key questions for as Europe moves ahead towards the goals of the European Green Deal. The report offers to better understand and govern just transitions. Delivering justice in Europe’s sustainability transition is multi-dimensional. It requires efforts to of climate and environmental policies across society, as well as of pollution and climate risks for places and people. At the same time, it also requires , enabling vulnerable groups to participate and recognising and engaging with different perspectives and cultures, the EEA report argues. Strategic approaches are increasingly used to explore possible futures and their implications for policy and planning. Considerable progress in the in the EU was made in 2022, with being electric vehicles. Totalling close to two million electric car registrations in one year, up from 1,74 million in 2021. The number of on European roads also continued to grow, reaching a share of 5.5% of new registrations in 2022.

For example, changes like moving away from owning a car towards ridesharing or using public transportation can be difficult to adopt for individuals, and car producers could lobby against the new solutions. Strong coordination is needed among the international community.

Growth is culturally, politically and institutionally ingrained. what is meant by growth and progress and their meaning for global sustainability. The various communities that live simply can offer inspiration for social innovation. The European Green Deal and other political initiatives for a sustainable future require not only technological change but also changes in consumption and social practices. While global food chains, market competition, industrial processes and increasing productivity have turned agriculture into a profitable economic sector, it is also one of the biggest contributors to environmental and sustainability challenges in Europe and worldwide. Considering these new challenges, it is even more urgent to rethink agriculture and food systems to make them resilient and sustainable. We should also be asking broader questions.

Man-made ozone-depleting substances destroy the protective ozone layer and, in 1987, the international community established the Montreal Protocol to cut their consumption and production. To fulfil its obligations under the Montreal Protocol, the EU has adopted the more ambitious EU Ozone Regulation. This online data viewer contains information on ozone-depleting substances in the EU, based on aggregated data reported by companies since 2006 under the Ozone Regulation. In 1989, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer entered into force. Its objective is to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production of . The protocol covers around 100 individual substances with a high , including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride (CTC), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), bromochloromethane (BCM) and methyl bromide (MB), all of which are referred to as ‘controlled substances’. Within the European Union (EU), the use of and trade in substances is regulated by Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (known as the ). This regulation stipulates that all companies producing controlled substances or importing them into and/or exporting them out of the EU, as well as feedstock users, process agent users and destruction facilities, must report their activities concerning controlled substances annually. The Ozone Regulation also encompasses five additional ODS that are not covered by the Montreal Protocol. These ‘new substances’ are halon 1202, methyl chloride (MC), ethyl bromide (EB), trifluoroiodomethane (TFIM) and n-propyl bromide (n-PB). Producers, importers and exporters also have to report their activities for these new substances and will cover three additional ozone-depleting substances. The European Environment Agency (EEA) is responsible for collecting, archiving, checking and aggregating information contained in these company reports. The EEA also supports the companies in fulfilling their reporting obligations. The data reported on production, imports and exports are presented to parties to the Montreal Protocol in order to monitor progress in phasing out ODS in compliance with the Protocol. In 2024, 191 companies reported on their 2023 activities under the Ozone Regulation. The EU has already achieved its phase-out goals under the Montreal Protocol and reports on the uses that are still allowed. This online data viewer summarizes the most recent data reported by companies under the Ozone Regulation and looks at trends since 2006. Data from 2012 onwards were also updated, based on reports resubmitted after the reporting deadlines for these years. Since the potential to harm the ozone layer varies among substances, results are expressed in both metric tonnes and ODP tonnes (see definition of ODP or ozone depleting potential in the terminology below). The observed trends can differ significantly depending on the unit used. Controlled substances with a relatively high ODP (e.g. CFCs and CTC) exhibit a different trend from those with a relatively low ODP (e.g. HCFCs). Consumption is an aggregated parameter calculated for data reported under the Montreal Protocol (see Box 1 below). It integrates the statistics on imports, exports, production and destruction of controlled substances into one single metric, excluding non-virgin imports and exports. Amounts that are produced and imported for feedstock use within the EU and process agent use are not included in consumption figures, in line with calculations applied under the Montreal Protocol. New substances listed in Annex II to the Ozone Regulation are also excluded from consumption data. In brief, consumption (which only applies to controlled substances) is calculated as follows: with In 2023, the consumption of controlled substances was positive, amounting to 1,306 metric tonnes, up from -2,954 metric tonnes in 2022. The positive consumption level is the result of significant stocks of quantities for ‘Feedstock outside the EU’ which are not reflected in total exports. The single activities that contribute to ODS consumption are shown in the figure below. If the sum of production and imports exceeds the sum of exports and destruction, the consumption is positive, and vice versa. In recent years, the consumption of controlled substances has largely been driven by CTC, HCFCs and CFC consumption. Expressed in ODP tonnes, consumption in 2023 amounted to 1,778 ODP tonnes, up from -3,165 ODP tonnes in 2022. In 2023, imports of controlled virgin substances into the EU amounted to 3,593 metric tonnes, which represents a 2% decrease compared to 2022. The imported controlled substances were almost entirely virgin substances and 80% of them were imported from China. Around 79% of the imported virgin quantities were HCFCs, followed by BCM and halons. Controlled virgin substances were almost exclusively imported for feedstock use. Imports of controlled non-virgin substances amounted to about 2% of total imports. Expressed in ODP tonnes, imports of virgin halons and HCFCs were largest. When expressed in ODP tonnes, imports are showing an increasing trend, up from 1,934 ODP tonnes in 2021 to 3,061 ODP tonnes in 2023. This is mainly due to increased import of Halons for feedstock use, which exhibit significant ODP. In 2023, exports of controlled virgin substances from the EU amounted to 27,274 metric tonnes. Overall, exports decreased by 31% compared to 2022. CTC accounted for the largest quantities of exported virgin substances (89% of total exports when expressed in metric tonnes), followed by HCFCs (11% of total exports). Both CTC and HCFCs were mainly exported for feedstock use outside the EU. ODS quantities were mainly exported to the United States (89%) and Great Britain (7%). Since almost no CTC was imported in 2023, the exported quantities were mainly produced in the EU or taken from stocks which had accumulated from previous years. Looking at ODP tonnes, exports decreased by 7%. In terms of proportions, exports of virgin CTC were also largest (99% of total exports when expressed in ODP tonnes). Similar to imports, controlled non-virgin substances were exported out of the EU to a much lesser extent than controlled virgin substances. In 2023, non-virgin substances compose less than 1% of total exports when expressed in metric tonnes. In 2023, the production of controlled substances in the EU amounted to 157,006 metric tonnes, a 20% decrease compared with 2022. Thereof, 32,599 metric tonnes are relevant for consumption. The quantities produced included mostly production of HCFCs, CTC and TCA. Only minor quantities of BCM, halons, CFCs and HBFCs, and no MB, were produced. In terms of metric tonnes, production for feedstock use inside the EU decreased by 20%, and production for process agent use showed a decrease in 2023 compared with 2022 as well. Production for other uses in metric tonnes, as accounted for in the estimation of the consumption of controlled substances (see Box 1 above and the section on consumption), decreased by 21% in 2023 compared with 2022. Expressed in ODP tonnes, production of CTC and HCFCs was largest (81% and 9% of total production, respectively). Controlled substances were mainly produced for feedstock use inside the EU (79% of the produced quantity in metric tonnes). In 2023, 4,020 metric tonnes of controlled substances were destroyed in total, an 16% decrease compared with 2022. The largest quantities destroyed were of CTC, CFCs and HCFCs (82%, 9% and 7% of total destruction, respectively). Expressed in ODP, destruction amounted to 4,064 ODP tonnes and decreased by 20% compared to the year before. The largest quantities destroyed were of CTC, CFCs and halons (90%, 9% and 1% of total destruction, respectively). A number of ODS serve as feedstock for the manufacture of other products such as refrigerants, foam blowing agents, polymers, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. In 2023, feedstock use amounted to 130,112 metric tonnes, a 17% decrease compared with 2022. Feedstock availability was 129,561 metric tonnes in 2023, down by 17% from 2022. Overall, feedstock availability, which is calculated as the sum of the production for feedstock use inside the EU and the imports for feedstock use inside the EU, was therefore at a comparable level to feedstock use, indicating that the EEA reporting systems covers all relevant undertakings from the supply as well from the production side. In 2022, the emission from feedstock uses was 0.04% of the reported make-up. The 2023 average emission rate was slightly higher than the emission rate in 2022 and also marginally higher than the average emission rate obtained from earlier years (2016 to 2022). A process agent is a substance that either facilitates or inhibits a chemical reaction in an industrial process. In 2023, total and emissions stayed well below restrictions imposed by both the Montreal Protocol and the Ozone Regulation. The Ozone Regulation is more stringent than the rules of the Montreal Protocol and encompasses new substances (halon 1202, n-PB, EB, TFIM and MC). In 2023, the production of new substances amounted to 614,362 metric tonnes, a 17% decrease compared with 2022. Production of new substances is therefore at its lowest level since 2009. The production of new substances was almost exclusively for feedstock use and related to MC (more than 99% of total production), n-PB and EB. Expressed in ODP tonnes, the production of MC was also largest (99% of total production). In 2023, the production of new substances was about four times higher than the production of controlled substances expressed in metric tonnes. However, when expressed in ODP tonnes, the production of new substances was around one fifth the production of controlled substances in the same year. This is because new substances, on average, have significantly lower ODP than controlled substances. ODS are substances, mainly compounds containing chlorine and/or bromine, that reach the stratosphere of the Earth and whose breakdown products react with the stratospheric ozone. This reduces the concentration levels of ozone in that region of the atmosphere (commonly known as the ozone layer) and thus the capacity of the atmosphere to filter ultraviolet light. Most known ODS are regulated under the Montreal Protocol. Controlled substances are ODS that are listed in Annex I of the Ozone Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009) and are subject to the reporting obligation of Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol. The term ‘mixtures’ refers to gas mixtures consisting of multiple substances, at least one of which is a controlled substance. Destruction facilities are required to report the quantities of individual substances destroyed each year. In certain cases, however, companies were only able to report on the destruction of mixtures of controlled substances with an unknown composition. Therefore, these mixtures are not included in the data presented in this online data viewer and are not reported under the Montreal Protocol. The term ‘new substances’ refers to the five additional substances covered by the EU Ozone Regulation that are not included within the scope of the Montreal Protocol: halon 1202, n-propyl bromide (n-PB), ethyl bromide (EB), trifluoroiodomethane (TFIM) and methyl chloride (MC). Companies in the EU are obliged to report on the import, export and production of these substances in line with the Ozone Regulation’s higher level of ambition than that of the Montreal Protocol. New substances should not be confused with virgin substances (see below). These are substances that have been produced and have not been previously used. Newly produced substances are, by definition, virgin. These are substances that have been previously used and subsequently recovered from products and equipment, and/or been recycled or reclaimed. A number of ODS serve as chemical building blocks for the manufacture of other chemicals (i.e. as ‘feedstock’). They are used (directly or indirectly) for the manufacture of a diverse range of products including refrigerants, foam blowing agents, solvents, polymers, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. A process agent is a substance that either facilitates a chemical reaction or inhibits an intended chemical reaction in an industrial process. Make-up is the quantity of virgin, recovered or reclaimed controlled substances that has not been used in the process cycle before, and that is fed into the process cycle for the first time. For feedstock and process agent uses of controlled substances, make-up has to be reported, including the emissions generated during their use. The ozone-depleting potential (ODP) of a substance refers to the relative amount of ozone depletion caused by it. It is the ratio of the impact on ozone of the emission of a chemical substance to the impact of a similar emission by mass of CFC-11. The quantity in metric tonnes of a particular controlled substance is multiplied by its ODP to give its overall potential to deplete the ozone layer. For instance, 1 metric tonne of CFC-11 corresponds to 1 ODP tonnes (as its ODP is equal to 1), whilst for bromotrifluoromethane or halon 1301 (with an ODP = 10), 1 metric tonne corresponds to 10 ODP tonnes. The ODPs of controlled and new substances are listed in Annexes I and II of the Ozone Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009). Some new substances have a range, rather than a single ODP value. In this online data viewer, the highest value of the ODP value range is used."

The report is the first of the series to be published annually until 2030. According to the EEA analysis, the EU may not meet the majority of the targets by 2030. The situation looks particularly challenging when it comes to the 8 EAP priority objective of reducing environmental and climate pressures related to production and consumption. This includes targets on energy consumption, rate of circular material use, and share of area under organic farming, which all look very unlikely to be achieved by 2030. However, the EEA report shows that the outlook of achieving several other 2030 monitoring targets looks positive. For instance, it is very likely that the share of green economy in the whole economy will continue to increase and that premature deaths attributable to exposure to fine particulate matter will decline in line with the zero-pollution action plan aim. The EEA report also examines some of the conditions that can enable meeting the 8 EAP objectives. Overall, the outlook for putting these conditions in place by 2030 is positive, but phasing out fossil fuel subsidies without delay seems unlikely as most EU Member States still lack concrete plans to do so, the EEA report notes. Our analysis shows that Member States need to urgently strengthen actions to meet Europe’s environment and climate ambitions by 2030. This includes full implementation of current laws, increased investments in future-proof technologies and making sustainability a central element in all policies. The EEA report concludes that a number of the 8 EAP monitoring targets reflect the high ambitions of the European Green Deal and that Member States may need more time to take measures to achieve them. At the same time, several of the targets require two to nine times faster pace of progress until 2030, compared with progress over the past 10 years. Overall, stronger implementation of existing legislation by the Member States, bringing forward additional policies and measures when necessary, and mainstreaming environment and climate policies into other policy areas are urgently needed, the EEA report states. The 8 EAP monitoring targets and indicators The EEA will assess progress towards the 8 EAP priority objectives annually and use the results of the 8 EAP monitoring reports in its upcoming flagship report on the state and outlook of the European environment, due for publication in 2025."

Greenhouse gas emission intensity of power generation in the European Union has returned to the overall decreasing trend of the past decades.

Generating one kilowatt hour is estimated to have emitted, on average, 19% less CO in 2023 than in 2022 and 35% less than a decade ago. Climate and energy policies have effectively lowered carbon-intensive electricity supply over time, resulting in less coal use, more renewables and a more efficient EU generation mix. The EU electricity sector is expected to provide one of the most significant contributions to by 2030 and be a cornerstone for the Union to reach net climate neutrality by 2050, according to behind the joint targets. For that to happen, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity of the sector needs to fall drastically through the end of this decade. In 2023, the EU’s electricity sector was estimated to be 58% less GHG intensive than it was in 1990 and 19% less thank 2022. Hydro and nuclear power returned to average generation levels, solar and wind power continued their growth and coal generation resumed its long-term decline. Electricity generation experienced a (3%, compared with , partly linked to a lower production in specific EU industrial sectors. Until 2010, the need to comply with industrial emissions legislation, such as the and the shift from fossil fuels to renewable electricity sources drove of EU electricity supply. As of 2010, the decrease has been almost exclusively due to the transition from fossil fuels to renewable electricity sources, with prices for emission allowances under the increasing, especially since 2019. To reduce the EU’s net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 (compared with 1990) and reach by 2050, electricity generation across the EU needs to decarbonise faster. Figure 1 visualises indicative intensity levels that would be consistent with the EU’s climate targets. Today’s geopolitical context further calls for a to replace gas, coal and oil use in power supply, heating and transport. This would also contribute to improved energy security and reduced electricity prices in the longer term. Additional policies and measures are needed to deploy renewable generation sources faster, provide incentives to users to save energy and participate actively in the electricity market, and ensure an optimised build out of electricity infrastructures across the European Union. The of electricity production differs significantly between Member States. Estonia, Poland, Cyprus and Bulgaria are estimated to have had the highest electricity generation carbon intensity in 2023. This is due to the use of solid fossil fuels, relatively few renewables and limited, or no, nuclear sources in their national electricity mixes. In eight additional Member States, the carbon intensity was higher than the EU average (Czechia, Greece, Germany, Malta, the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy and Romania). Yet, the GHG intensities for electricity production were lowest in Sweden, Luxembourg and Finland, because of their high share of low-carbon electricity sources (renewables and nuclear power). For , estimates show the highest rates of decarbonisation in electricity production over the 1990-2023 period in Luxembourg (87% decrease), Denmark (86%), Slovakia (82%) and Latvia (81%). In non-EU EEA countries, all electricity produced in Iceland and most produced in Norway comes from renewable sources, therefore their GHG emission intensities are very low. Türkiye has a relatively high GHG emission intensity of electricity generation. The CO emission intensity is calculated as the ratio of CO emissions from electricity generation and gross electricity generation. The GHG intensity of total electricity generation is taken as the ratio of CO equivalent emissions from all electricity production (both from main activity producers and auto-producers) to total electricity generation, including electricity from nuclear plants and renewable sources. For main activity producers, the CO e emissions from electricity generation only (i.e. excluding emissions resulting from heat production), were estimated as follows: a) Estimating the transformation input for gross heat production by formula: . b) Estimating the transformation input for electricity generation by subtracting the estimated transformation input for gross heat production from total transformation input for electricity and heat generation, by formula ; c) Multiplying the ratio of b) and the transformation input for electricity and heat generation (ESTAT codes TI_EHG_MAPE_E, TI_EHG_MAPCHP_E, and TI_EHG_MAPH_E) to total CO e emissions from public electricity and heat production (1A1a from the EEA data viewer). Formula: . The reported CO e emissions in class 1A1a do not include CO e emissions from autoproducers. Emissions from electricity generated by autoproducers were estimated by multiplying the ratio of the energy input for autoproducers and the energy input for main activity producers by the CO e emissions from main activity producers (as calculated in steps a-c above). The energy input for electricity generation by autoproducers was estimated using the same method as for main activity producers (a and b above) using the ESTAT codes GHP_APH and GHP_APCHP for gross heat production and TI_EHG_APE_E, TI_EHG_APCHP_E, and TI_EHG_APH_E for transformation input for electricity and heat production. A zero CO e emission factor was applied to nuclear power and to renewables (including the biodegradable fraction of municipal solid waste), as the method does not take into account life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. This applies also to solid biofuels: in accordance with the United Framework Convention on Climate Change Reporting Guidelines, biofuel-related emissions have to be reported as a memorandum item in greenhouse gas emission inventories, with the assumption being that harvesting emissions would be shown as changes in carbon stocks in the land use, land use change and forestry sector, not in the energy sector. This should not be interpreted, however, as an endorsement of default carbon neutrality or the sustainability of biofuels. The denominator of the GHG intensity of total electricity production is the sum of electricity produced from main activity producers (ESTAT: GEP_MAPE and GEP_MAPCHP) and autoproducers (ESTAT: GEP_APE and GEP_APCHP). Calculation Formula: (CO e * ((ei_MAP – dh_MAP)/ei_MAP))*((ei_AP-dh_AP)/(ei_MAP-dh_MAP))+CO e*((ei_MAP–dh_MAP)/ei_MAP)))/(GEP/85.98), where: The EU aims to be climate-neutral (i.e. its economy will emit net-zero greenhouse gas emissions) by 2050. This objective is at the heart of the European Green Deal and in line with the EU's commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement. Decarbonising electricity supply, for instance by substantially accelerating the deployment of renewable energy sources to achieve a share of almost 70% in electricity generation by 2030 and over 80% by 2050, is critical to achieving this objective.

The index is also for mobile phones in all EU languages. Air pollution from large European industry continues to cause significant damage to the environment, climate and people’s health. The analysis shows that just a small fraction of the most polluting facilities — many of them coal power plants — causes half of the total damage.

The report notes that Europe has already made significant progress over the past two decades in terms of climate change mitigation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Signs of progress are also evident in other areas, such as tackling air and water pollution and the introduction of new policies to tackle plastic waste and bolster climate change adaptation and the circular and bio-economy. Furthermore, the EU’s sustainable finance initiative is the first of its kind on the role of the financial sector in driving the necessary shift to a sustainable future. While these achievements are significant, Europe will not achieve its sustainability vision of ‘living well within the limits of the planet’ by continuing to promote economic growth and seeking to manage the environmental and social impacts. The report urges European countries, leaders and policymakers to seize the opportunity and use the next decade to radically scale up and speed up actions to put Europe back on track to meeting its medium and longer-term environmental policy goals and targets to avoid irreversible change and damage. The current range of European policy actions provide an essential foundation for future progress but they are not enough. Europe needs to do things better, it needs to address certain challenges differently, and it needs to rethink its investments. Achieving Europe’s goals will require better implementation and improved coordination between current policies. It will also need additional policy actions to achieve fundamental change in the key systems of production and consumption that underpin our modern lifestyles, such as food, energy and mobility, which have substantial environmental impacts. The report also stresses the importance of how governments can enable a transition to sustainability and the need to address things differently. For example, Europe should rethink how it uses existing innovations and technologies, how production processes could be improved, how research and development into sustainability could be fostered and how changes in consumption patterns and ways of living could be stimulated. Lastly, achieving such change will require investing in a sustainable future and stopping using public funds to subsidise environmentally damaging activities. Europe will gain immensely from such a change in investment priorities because of the economic and social opportunities that it can create. At the same time, it will be crucial to listen to public concerns and ensure widespread support for such a shift — a socially fair transition. The State of the Environment Report is perfectly timed to give us the added impetus we need as we start a new five-year cycle in the European Commission and as we prepare to present the European Green Deal. In the next five years we will put in place a truly transformative agenda, rolling out new clean technologies, helping citizens to adapt to new job opportunities and changing industries, and shifting to cleaner and more efficient mobility systems and more sustainable food and farming. There will be multiple benefits for Europe and for Europeans if we get this right, and our economy and our planet will be winners too. This is an urgent global challenge, and a unique opportunity for Europe ‘Europe’s environment is at a tipping point. We have a narrow window of opportunity in the next decade to scale up measures to protect nature, lessen the impacts of climate change and radically reduce our consumption of natural resources. Our assessment shows that incremental changes have resulted in progress in some areas but not nearly enough to meet our long-term goals. We already have the knowledge, technologies and tools we need to make key production and consumption systems such as food, mobility and energy sustainable. Our future well-being and prosperity depend on this and our ability to harness society wide action to bring about change and create a better future,’ Overall environmental trends in Europe have not improved since the last EEA state of the environment report in 2015. The assessment notes that while most of the 2020 targets will not be achieved, especially those on biodiversity, there is still a chance to meet the longer-term goals and objectives for 2030 and 2050. Europe has made important gains in resource efficiency and the circular economy. But recent trends highlight a slowing down of progress in areas such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, industrial emissions, waste generation, improving energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy. Looking ahead, the current rate of progress will not be enough to meet 2030 and 2050 climate and energy targets. Protecting and conserving European biodiversity and nature remains the biggest area of discouraging progress. Of the 13 specific policy objectives set for 2020 in this area, only two are likely be met: designating marine protected areas and terrestrial protected areas. Looking ahead to 2030, if current trends continue, they will result in further deterioration of nature and continued pollution of air, water and soil. Climate change, air and noise pollution impacts on the environment and human health are also still of concern. Exposure to fine particulate matter is responsible for around 400 000 premature deaths in Europe every year, affecting central and eastern European countries disproportionally. There is also growing concern over hazardous chemicals and the risks they pose. Looking ahead, the prospects for reducing environmental risks to health would be improved with better integration of environment and health policies. Achieving Europe’s low carbon and sustainability vision is still possible. The report outlines seven key areas where bold action is needed to get Europe back on track to achieve its 2030 and 2050 goals and ambitions. The European environment – state and outlook 2020 is published by the EEA every five years as mandated in its regulation. SOER 2020 is the 6th SOER published by the EEA since 1995. It offers solid, science-based insights on how we must respond to the huge and complex challenges we face, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and air and water pollution. SOER 2020 has been prepared in close collaboration with the EEA’s European Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet). The report draws on the Eionet’s vast expertise of leading experts and scientists in the environmental field, across the EEA’s 33 member countries and six cooperating countries. , please go to or scan the QR code.

Not long after the new coronavirus arrived in Europe, the EEA published Drivers of change of relevance for Europe’s environment and sustainability. The report’s main key message is bold: the desirable normal does not exist. Public participation in environmental decision-making is a legal right in Europe. This principle was established two decades ago by the Aarhus Convention. Since then, it has been increasingly recognised that participation is not only a matter of justice and democracy but also a practical necessity for transitioning into sustainability. This briefing focuses on different forms of public participation from a sustainability transitions perspective, highlights its core tenets, principles and pitfalls. The ways in which societies, institutions and citizens relate to and value nature have played a key role in the interconnected biodiversity, climate change, natural resource and health crises we face. This briefing explores how to reframe the relationships between humans and nature. It examines how holistically understanding humans’ deep interconnection with other life forms and ecosystems could lead to new motivations to protect nature and accelerate the societal transformation we need to live well within the limits of the planet. While global food chains, market competition, industrial processes and increasing productivity have turned agriculture into a profitable economic sector, it is also one of the biggest contributors to environmental and sustainability challenges in Europe and worldwide. This briefing reflects on what makes agriculture unsustainable today — and the types of agriculture we may want to preserve and support. This briefing reflects on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. It asks how these lessons can be applied to our quest for sustainability and how we can govern our societies in a way that respects planetary health as a precondition for human and economic health Innovation is both a primary source of systemic environmental and sustainability challenges and an essential element in society’s response to such challenges. Technological innovation, which is a policy priority across Europe, has historically been a major ‘driver of change’ for society and the ecosphere. Although technological innovations deliver a multitude of benefits, they are also associated with significant collateral hazards and new challenges. Economic growth is closely linked to increases in production, consumption and resource use and has detrimental effects on the natural environment and human health. It is unlikely that a long-lasting, absolute decoupling of economic growth from environmental pressures and impacts can be achieved at the global scale; therefore, societies need to rethink what is meant by growth and progress and their meaning for global sustainability.

For several decades, the European Union (EU) has had air quality in place for key air pollutants in the . If levels exceed these binding standards, Member States should prepare air quality plans to address the sources responsible and ensure compliance. Although these values were based on the 2005 WHO air quality guidelines, they also reflected the technical and economic feasibility of their attainment across EU Member States. The EU air quality standards are therefore less demanding than the 2005 WHO air quality guidelines.

Having a look at the past trend, from 2005 to 2020, premature deaths in the EU attributable to PM exposure above the WHO guideline level fell by 45% (see ). Should air quality continue to improve at this rate and the number of premature deaths continue to fall at a comparable rate in the future, the target would be achieved by 2026. However, this estimation is based purely on the assumption that the observed trend will continue. It is not a projection, since it does not factor in any recent policy developments or additional efforts taken to improve air quality since 2020. To estimate premature deaths, all-cause (natural) mortality is considered in people over 30 for concentrations above the 2021 WHO guideline level of 5 µg/m , assuming a linear increase in the risk of mortality of 8% for a 10 μg/m increase in concentrations of PM . The evolution in the number of premature deaths is based on the continuation of the past rate of reduction in premature deaths. Continuously reducing particulate matter concentrations in ambient air over the next decade will be challenging. To meet the target, Member States will need to fully implement their national air pollution control programmes (NACPCs), as well as measures needed to reach the 2030 climate and energy targets ( ). In terms of exposure, an increasingly ageing and urbanising European population counteracts some of the health gains associated with the reduction in ambient air pollution concentrations. Firstly, older people are more sensitive to air pollution. Secondly, a higher rate of urbanisation typically means that more people are exposed to PM concentrations, which tend to be higher in cities. The WHO refer to concentrations of key air pollutants above which adverse health effects are known to occur. They offer quantitative, health-based recommendations for air quality management and provide an evidence-based tool for policy makers working on air quality. The WHO air quality guidelines also include ‘interim targets’ — levels associated with a qualified reduction in the risk to health — that inform the development of pollution reduction policies that are achievable in realistic timeframes in highly polluted areas. WHO recommends that ‘the interim targets be regarded as steps towards the ultimate achievement of air quality guideline levels in the future, rather than as an end target’. Since 2014, the EEA has been estimating mortality due to exposure to air pollution, with support from our European Topic Centres. Mortality is the most serious health outcome of exposure to air pollution, with robust scientific evidence of causality and for which data are more widely available. At the same time, studies increasingly show that ambient air pollution is also associated with morbidity due to several chronic conditions, such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( ). As a result, the share of morbidity in the total burden of disease for selected diseases is considerable. Concentration-response functions are used to attribute a health risk to exposure to air pollution. These functions are based on epidemiological studies and estimate the increase in risk per unit of concentration of a certain air pollutant. As an example, the concentration-response function for mortality from exposure to PM used in this briefing assumes a linear increase in the relative risk of mortality of 8% per 10 µg/m increase in the annual mean concentration of PM (as recommended in ). So far, the EEA used the concentration-response functions for mortality recommended by WHO in their 2013 report on the . In this briefing, EEA applies for the first time the concentration-response functions for mortality set out in the . For both PM and O the risk of mortality associated with incremental increases in concentrations is now higher, while for NO the associated risk is slightly lower. An increased risk of mortality will increase the estimates of premature deaths per unit of air pollution, while a decreased risk will do the opposite. An additional change to the method of calculating mortality has to do with the range of concentrations considered. Until 2021 and based on the , all concentrations were considered for PM ; only concentrations above 20 µg/m were considered for NO and only concentrations above 70 µg/m for O . Following the , the main analysis presented in this briefing calculated mortality for concentrations above 5 μg/m for PM and above 10 μg/m for NO . These values correspond to the new air quality guideline levels, below which the level of uncertainty surrounding the concentration-response functions is higher. This change reduces premature death estimates, since health impacts below the WHO guideline levels are not accounted for (although they are considered in a sensitivity analysis). Regarding O , the concentration from which premature deaths are calculated remains unchanged at 70 µg/m . Note that the estimates of premature deaths presented here may differ from others calculated at national and European levels due to differences in methodological choices. As an example, the estimated number of premature deaths presented in this assessment is higher than those presented in the Study to support the impact assessment for a revision of the EU Ambient Air Quality Directives ( ). The kinds of methodological choices that can affect estimates of premature deaths include: The EEA uses concentration maps with the same resolution and applies the same assumptions for all of Europe, enabling a robust comparison across European countries. For morbidity, years lived with disability (YLD) were estimated for ten pollutant-disease pairs. For these pairs, scientific evidence of an association between exposure to a specific air pollutant and the disease is robust and enough data for the estimations were available. Morbidity was calculated for the European countries for which health data was also available. The number of countries varied between 23 and 35, depending on the disease. For PM , morbidity was estimated for: For NO , morbidity was estimated for: For O , estimates were calculated for the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases. In 2020 in the EU-27: In 2020 in Europe (please see the countries considered in tables 2 and 3): It is important to note that the numbers of premature deaths presented here do not capture possible additional deaths caused by exposure to PM and NO concentrations below the respective 2021 WHO guideline levels (for which the scientific evidence is less certain than for health impacts above the WHO guideline levels). Furthermore, there is no evidence of a threshold below which air pollution does not impact health. With this in mind, EEA has also performed a sensitivity analysis of premature deaths for exposure to PM and NO at concentrations above 0 µg/m . For O , premature deaths were calculated for exposure to concentrations above 20 µg/m . This enables comparison with results in previous EEA assessments on the impact of air pollution on health (where the old methodology was used). The level of uncertainty around these estimates is higher than for the estimates of health impacts presented above. Table 1 presents the potential additional premature deaths and potential total premature deaths by pollutant for the EU-27 and for the larger number of European countries included in the assessment. The EEA table presents, for all considered countries and the different aggregations, the estimates from 2005 to 2020 of the premature deaths attributable to exposure to PM , NO and O . It takes into account the methodology used until last year, the current methodology and the one used for the sensitivity analysis. presents the total country population, the population-weighted mean concentrations and the estimated number of attributable premature deaths by country in 2020. presents the YLL and YLL per 100,000 inhabitants associated with exposure to PM , NO and O concentration levels in 2020. When comparing 2020 to 2019, the number of premature deaths attributable to air pollution increased for PM but decreased for NO and O . Apart from the changes in concentrations and demographics, the number of premature deaths was also influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 incremented the number of natural deaths in 2020. For PM , falls in concentrations were counteracted by an increase in deaths due to the pandemic. In the case of NO , significant falls in concentrations were seen as a direct result of reductions in road transport during COVID-19 lockdowns ( ). The impact lower concentrations had in terms of reducing mortality countered the excess deaths due to COVID-19. The sections below provide information at country level on the health impacts of key pollutants For PM , the highest absolute numbers of premature deaths in 2020 were seen in Italy, Poland, Germany, Romania and Spain, in order of decreasing rank. When considering YLL per 100,000 inhabitants, the highest relative numbers were observed in central and eastern European countries. This is where the highest concentrations of PM were also observed; namely, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Bulgaria, in order of decreasing rank. The lowest relative health impacts due to PM exposure were seen in countries situated in the north and north-west of Europe, including Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia. For NO the highest absolute numbers of premature deaths in 2020 were seen in Türkiye, Italy, Germany, Spain and France, in order of decreasing rank. When considering YLL per 100,000 inhabitants, the highest relative numbers were observed in Bulgaria, Türkiye, Romania, Greece and Serbia, in order of decreasing rank. The lowest relative health impacts due to NO exposure were seen in Estonia, Iceland, Finland, Sweden and Denmark. The countries with the highest absolute numbers of premature deaths in 2020 due to exposure to O were Italy, Germany, France, Spain and Türkiye, in order of decreasing rank. The countries with the highest rates of YLL per 100,000 inhabitants were Albania, Montenegro, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia, in order of decreasing rank. The countries with the lowest relative impacts were Iceland, Finland, Ireland, Norway and Sweden. The following section presents estimates of morbidity for the diseases that entail the most significant health burden; namely, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for PM and diabetes mellitus (also known as Type 2 diabetes) for NO . For O , the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory disease in adults aged 65 was used as a proxy for morbidity. These results are based on the ETC/HE report. Estimating the morbidity related environmental burden of disease due to exposure to PM , NO and O in outdoor ambient air ( ). It estimated the morbidity associated with ten pollutant-disease pairs in 2019. For these pairs, the scientific evidence of an association between exposure to a specific air pollutant and the disease is robust and enough health data for the calculations were available. In 2019, the morbidity effects of in adults aged 25 and above resulting from exposure to in 30 European countries was estimated at 175,702 YLD. The highest absolute burden was seen in Germany with 38,460 YLDs; in contrast, the lowest was in Iceland with less than 10 YLDs. When accounting for population, the highest rates were seen in Serbia (90 YLD per 100,000 inhabitants), Lithuania (85 YLD per 100,000 inhabitants) and Croatia (81 YLD per 100,000 in habitants). The lowest rates were seen in Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Iceland (see Figure 2). In 2019, the morbidity effects of in adults aged 35 and above resulting from exposure to in 31 European countries was estimated at 175,070 YLDs. The highest absolute burden from diabetes mellitus was seen in Türkiye, with 54,186 YLDs. The lowest was in Iceland with 18 YLDs. When accounting for population, the highest rates were seen in Türkiye (146 YLDs per 100,000 inhabitants), Cyprus (76 YLDs per 100,000 inhabitants) and Greece (61 YLDs per 100,000 inhabitants). The lowest rates were seen in Estonia, Sweden and Denmark (see Figure 3). For O , the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory disease in adults aged 65 and above was used as a proxy for morbidity (since no study was identified linking the incidence or prevalence of diseases to exposure to O ). In 2019, a total of 12,253 hospital admissions were attributable to exposure to O across 23 European countries. The highest absolute number of hospital admissions was estimated for Italy (3,059) and the lowest number for Iceland (<10). The highest numbers of hospital admissions by population attributable to exposure to O were seen in Austria (29 per 100,000 inhabitants), Spain (28 per 100,000 inhabitants) and Italy (22 per 100,000 inhabitants). The lowest rates were observed for Iceland, Latvia and the Netherlands (Figure 4).

Briefing This narrative is part of a series called ‘ ’ published by the EEA’ Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a year of involuntary as well as voluntary change. While there is still no consensus on how the infectious agent SARS-CoV-2 emerged, the study by Cheng et al. (2007) has been put forward as an example of an early warning. They wrote: Coronaviruses are well known to undergo genetic recombination, which may lead to new genotypes and outbreaks. The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. The possibility of the re-emergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored (Cheng et al., 2007, p.683). Human progress depends on the ability and willingness to learn from the past. The way early warnings of environmental and human hazards emerge, and how they are dealt with, provides us with many ‘late’ lessons (EEA, 2001, 2013). These lessons can help pave the way towards more resilient and better-prepared societies. Previous EEA reports describe cases of unintended environmental hazards caused by the use of chemicals or other activities (EEA, 2001, 2013). These late lessons mainly highlight the need for precautionary approaches and how to strike a balance between desired economic opportunities and uncertain environmental harm. Plagues and pandemics have occurred throughout human history (Waltner-Toews, 2020). However, today’s globalised societies and economies, and the way we interact with the natural environment, affect the way pandemics develop. There is little doubt that new pathogens are often created at the interfaces between wild and domestic animals and humans, and that these sometimes manifest as zoonotic disease (Figure 1). According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2020), ‘60 per cent of known infectious diseases in humans and 75 per cent of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic’, while at least six outbreaks of novel coronaviruses were observed in the last century. Several interacting drivers underpin the emergence of zoonotic diseases by creating novel and diverse contacts among wildlife, livestock and people. These include (1) population growth and rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation, (2) increasing demand for animal protein, with a consequent increase in exploitation of wildlife, agricultural intensification and trade, (3) inadequate husbandry practices and (4) poorly managed informal wildlife and fresh produce markets, and industrial meat processing plants (UNEP, 2020). It is also clear that today’s high levels of international trade and travel make pathogens spread faster, as ‘diseases can now move around the world in periods shorter than their incubation periods’ (UNEP, 2020). : EEA (2020a), adapted from Jones et al. (2013) More attention is also being paid to these complexities in policy fields outside epidemiology and public health, as health crises like COVID-19 have far-reaching implications for people and society at large. The Council of Europe recently addressed the relationship between pandemics and democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law. It reminds us that the COVID-19 crisis should not be used as a pretext for restricting the public’s access to information, and that emergency measures taken by Member States should not undermine EU’s founding values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Council of Europe, 2020). One positive thing that we’ve learned from COVID-19 is that contemporary societies are in fact able to ‘act with necessary force’ when required (Mahmood and Sanchez, 2020). New regulations can be quickly enforced, with certain social practices and economic activities even being prohibited. Airports, restaurants, sports arenas and schools can be closed overnight if the reason is considered legitimate (at least when it is seen as temporary). EU Member States have willingly taken measures against COVID-19 that have had enormous economic costs, along with creating the risk of economic recession and severe unemployment. The global community will need years, if not decades, to assess the full extent of COVID-19 and its implications for our society, including its impacts on inequalities, health and the well-being of citizens (EEA, 2020b). Unprecedented national lockdowns, travel restrictions and the closing of national borders in the first half of 2020 and since have led to short-term improvements in the environment in Europe. Reductions in traffic, shipping and aviation led to sudden improvements in air quality and noise levels, with the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO ) in some cities declining by up to 60% compared with the same period in 2019 (EEA, 2020c). The pandemic also had the immediate effect of encouraging people to choose more active modes of travel. The increase in cycling in particular has prompted cities to become more bike friendly, including by introducing new cycling infrastructure (Kraus and Koch, 2021; Nikitas et al., 2021). A reduction in human activity gave habitats the chance to recover and species the opportunity to occupy new spaces and niches (EEA, 2020d). Moreover, preliminary data show that EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decreased by 10% from 2019 to 2020 (EEA, 2021a). As a society, we should learn from past experiences. The 2008-2009 financial crisis led to lower emissions, but the effect was short-lived (Peters et al., 2012). Now, once again, the imperative to emerge from economic recession and the apparent resilience of unsustainable political and economic priorities provide little hope that the post-corona planet will be more sustainable, unless there is an active and conscious change in social and economic practices. : EEA (2021c) During the pandemic, we have struggled with and learned to cope with the crisis. For a time, we changed our daily actions and reoriented our priorities, valued things differently and perhaps appreciated the natural world around us more. Yet, the question remains as to whether we have changed in any fundamental way. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the systemic frailty of our global economy and society (EEA, 2020e). It is not going too far to say that we are currently living in a world characterised by multiple global crises: a health crisis, an economic and financial crisis, a climate crisis and a crisis in nature (EEA, 2020e). One thing that the history of pandemics has taught us is that more pandemics should be expected (Waltner-Toews, 2020) and we should at the very least be prepared. ‘COVID-19 is not only a wake-up call, it is a dress rehearsal for the world of challenges to come […] The pandemic has taught us that our choices matter. As we look to the future, let us make sure we choose wisely.’ A. Guterres (2020), Secretary-General of the United Nations Taking the early warning from Cheng et al. (2007) seriously would mean considering a range of measures globally, including tackling illegal wildlife trade, closing down illegal food markets, tightening the regulation of industrial meat production, changing social and cultural food practices and, ultimately, changing unsustainable patterns of consumption, urbanisation and natural habitat destruction (IPBES, 2020). As highlighted by the OECD (2021), returning to business as usual would mean missing a vital opportunity to tackle underlying and interconnected environmental, economic, social and relational challenges that pre-date COVID-19. A well-being approach could guide the process of ‘building back better’ (OECD, 2021), especially if underpinned by the realisation that environmental health is a prerequisite for public health. We do not lack knowledge or ideas for action. The limiting factor is agency, the agency to address the driving forces underpinning this and other global crises. The next crisis, whatever form it takes, is likely to reveal itself for what it is: yet another symptom of the same underlying problem — unsustainable human production and consumption (EEA, 2020e). It is this chronic problem that continues to express itself in challenges that are framed either as ‘issues’ — to be addressed in premeditated policy cycles — or as ‘crises’ — requiring extraordinary and emergency measures (Lakoff, 2017). Therefore, our societies’ governance approaches should address not only the underlying roots of the problems themselves, but also the increasingly frequent or even simultaneous emergence of what we used to think of as exceptional crises. To address the sustainability problem we face, social and economic practices must change across different levels and aspects of society: the way we live our lives and the way we eat, move and power our societies cannot remain the same. While enduring COVID-19 lockdowns, French anthropologist and philosopher Bruno Latour proposed an exercise of reflection (Latour, 2020). He suggested that we consider which suspended activities we would like to see gone for good and which we would like to resume; which brand-new activities or habits we would like to develop in the aftermath of the pandemic; and how workers or entrepreneurs disenfranchised by a reshaped economy might be helped to transition into other, more sustainable or more resilient roles or activities. While this exercise can be performed individually, it also gives rise to fundamental questions that deserve attention at institution level. Given the wide recognition that sustainability transitions depend on certain practices being phased out (EEA, 2019), the exercise could even serve as inspiration for the further development and implementation of the European Green Deal. COVID-19 triggered sudden and forceful action. Emergencies have their own dynamics and risks, not least to democracy and legality. Yet, we have seen that, where there’s a will, there’s a way. Reflecting on the unprecedented mobilisation and impact of responses to COVID-19 can inspire new ways of thinking and help humanity to seize the moment and make a change. If we can temporarily shut down parts of society to survive the threat of COVID-19, it seems entirely reasonable that we can make significant societal changes to prevent COVID-22, -25 or -30, not to mention the other threats due to climate change and environmental degradation that we will most likely face.

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. News The EEA briefing ‘ ’ reflects on how social and technological innovation could contribute to more sustainable societies by avoiding technology-sourced, man-made environmental problems, and by shifting emphasis from technology-driven to people-driven solutions. New governance mechanisms and balancing experimentation and precaution can channel the potential of different types of innovation towards sustainability. Many sustainability-driven technologies promise positive outcomes, but the consequences of such innovations are difficult to anticipate, the EEA briefing points out. For example, large-scale production of first-generation biofuels resulted in deforestation and other land use changes that affected ecosystems and biodiversity. Problems arise also when improved efficiency leads to increased consumption or when technological innovations lead to lock-ins and path dependency. The EEA briefing argues for an innovation governance that enables citizens and societies to participate and engage in positive, transformative change beyond consumer choices. The new briefing is part of the ‘ ’ series, which brings new perspectives to the fore that could trigger change in the way we think and act towards sustainability. , please go to or scan the QR code.

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Article Europe, like the rest of the world, is facing an unprecedented public health crisis, quickly spreading across the continent. News channels report regular updates on the number of people who are affected and lost their lives. European and national authorities have been implementing drastic measures to limit and slow down the spread of Covid-19. Restrictions on travelling, commuting and social gatherings are severely impacting several key economic sectors. Many flights are cancelled, and schools, restaurants and borders are closing. The term ‘lock-down’ captures the new reality in many European countries. A The first and foremost priority is to minimise the impacts on Europeans’ health and ensure the best possible provision of health services to those affected, followed by ensuring well-being, including jobs and livelihoods. In this difficult period, the EEA has been asked on many occasions about the impact of Covid-19 measures on the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions. One of the unintended outcomes of such abrupt socio-economic shocks may be extra reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. . In many of our reports, we have underlined the link between the economic performance of some sectors and environmental impacts. This current crisis is expected to have a strong effect on production and consumption patterns, such as reducing demand on mobility, including international aviation and daily commuting by private cars. However, to have a clearer understanding of the extent, the duration, as well as some expected and unexpected effects, we need to analyse the data in various domains after we get out of the crisis. The EEA is planning to assess these links and will share the results of such analysis in due course. However, without a fundamental transformation of our production and consumption systems, any emission reduction triggered by such economic crises is likely to be short-lived and come at an extremely high cost to society. Europe aims to achieve climate neutrality through gradual and irreversible emission reductions and by setting long-term objectives to build a resilient economy and a resilient society, and not through disruptive shocks. This current crisis shows why we also need the transition to be a just one, offering new opportunities and support to those most affected. Earlier this month, the European Commission proposed the , which aims to establish a long-term framework, complementing existing legislation, to achieve climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050. The European Union already has one of the most ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, supported by a comprehensive legislative package. What makes this proposal unique is that it makes climate neutrality by 2050 a legally binding target. When adopted, the European Union and its Member States will be required by law to comply and take the necessary measures to achieve it. The European Union has been reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the last three decades. The EEA's shows that in 2018, EU greenhouse gas emissions were 23.2% below 1990 levels. It also asserts that extra effort and additional measures are needed to achieve the current 2030 target, set as ‘at least 40% reduction below 1990 levels’. Despite these reductions, the Europe’s Environment — state and outlook 2020 ( ) report concludes that to tackle environmental degradation and climate change, we need to transform fundamentally the way we produce and consume goods and services. These findings confirm the urgent need for speeding up and scaling up transitions in key systems, including energy, food and mobility. The European Climate Law proposal, which is one of the key components of the European Green Deal, is put forward against this background and raises the EU’s ambition level even higher. The proposal requires the European Commission to review the current 2030 target and ‘explore options for a new 2030 target of 50 to 55% emissions reductions compared to 1990’. It also outlines how . In addition to mitigation efforts, the proposal foresees regular assessments of climate adaptation measures. These climate objectives cannot be achieved without tackling the overarching sustainability challenge. Just as the European Commission is coming forth with other initiatives under the European Green Deal umbrella, including on circular economy, biodiversity and sustainable finance, our work addresses a number of areas to support sustainability transitions. Even if it results in significant temporary reductions in emissions, Covid-19 is and will remain a serious public health crisis. Covid-19 and its multiple impacts on our society cannot in any way be perceived as an event with positive outcomes. Even those of us who, based on our expertise and knowledge, have been vocal and calling for serious changes in our systems of production and consumption, should not see the massive shut down of our society as an acceptable solution to urgent and systemic sustainability challenges. The question remains: ? I think we can. In my opinion, a socially just transition planned and implemented over a long term is the only way forward to build a resilient society with a strong and sustainable economy. Moreover, the investments we will make to mitigate the economic impacts of this crisis should be, and can be, fully aligned with our long-term sustainability goals. Even during these trying times, the European institutions have confirmed their strong commitment to the long-term objectives of the European Green Deal. This will require strong partners, and that is exactly what the EEA aims to be. EEA Executive Director Editorial published in the , please go to or scan the QR code.

Definitions of key general terms and concepts are provided, followed by definitions of specific terms used as part of the EEA’s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability. (to urban environmental sustainability transitions) Difficulties that may be preventing some cities from reaching their sustainability potential or from overcoming long-standing economic, institutional and cultural challenges leading to suboptimal environmental outcomes and preventing more radical change from taking place. Key qualities that contribute to urban environmental sustainability. Depending on the context and enabling factors, different building blocks will be the inputs required to transition towards urban environmental sustainability. One of the four main components of the EEA’s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks). A model of production and consumption that aims to maintain the value of products, materials and resources for as long as possible by returning them to the product cycle at the end of their use while minimising the generation of waste. A large and densely populated urban settlement. A city is defined in relation to a political level (administrative boundary) and a densely populated ‘urban centre’ (population > 50 000). A circular model of resource management in which products, materials, built assets and land are kept in use while maintaining their value. It also means minimising waste generation. The additional benefits above and beyond the direct benefits intended from the main action or measures to improve urban environmental sustainability. Sometimes referred to as ‘multiple benefits’ or ‘synergies’. One of a range of terms describing formations of cities that are used in the literature and by different organisations. Compact cities have a range of potential benefits, including dense development patterns, better accessibility to local services and jobs, short intra-urban distances and public transport systems that make positive contributions to the efficiency of infrastructure investments, reductions in energy consumption and CO emissions, knowledge diffusion and economic growth. A way of breaking down the complex concept of urban environmental sustainability into its key components and interrelationships to help provide the EEA with a clear structure for its thinking, including in terms of: The range of current and historical physical, social and institutional characteristics that create and shape the setting in which a specific city exists, develops and functions. Each city’s context has a considerable influence on its transition to urban environmental sustainability. One of the four main components of the EEA’s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks). Factors that encourage cities to transition to urban environmental sustainability and facilitate some cities to reach their sustainability potential. Factors that lead to positive environmental outcomes and support more radical change. Relatively high-level forces that, based on their level of availability, facilitate (drivers) or hinder (barriers) the transition towards urban environmental sustainability. One of the four main components of the EEA’s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks). Consists of a city and its commuting zone. Functional urban areas therefore consist of a densely inhabited city and a less densely populated commuting zone whose labour market is highly integrated with the city. A strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services (as defined by the European Commission’s communication on green infrastructure — EC, 2013). Green infrastructure is present in both rural and urban settings. In urban areas, many different features may be part of green infrastructure (e.g. parks, gardens, grassy verges, green walls or green roofs) in so far as they are part of an interconnected network and are delivering multiple ecosystem services. These green urban elements (or blue if aquatic ecosystems are concerned) may be found within the city and in its peri-urban area. The outcome of the economic stimulus packages and recovery plans that governments have put in place to bring about a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that is both green and inclusive. This will, for example, create opportunities for income, jobs and growth, and at the same time accelerate action on medium- and long-term environmental goals, both national and global. A range of perspectives on urban environmental sustainability that represent priority issues/concerns reflecting the EEA’s environmental remit and that can be used to guide/focus assessment and analysis. One of the four main components of the EEA’s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks). An urban reform movement that gained prominence in the 1990s and seeks to promote urban qualities that reformers have been seeking for over a century: vital, beautiful, just, environmentally benign human settlements. Nexus— the interlinkages and interrelationships between two or more systems (e.g. food and energy) or policy areas relevant to urban environmental sustainability. Nexus analysis— the identification and analysis of the interactions, interrelationships and interdependencies among sectors and policies or other interventions. Nexus approach— the consideration of two or more urban policy areas in order to address a specific urban environmental sustainability problem or to advance a policy objective. By identifying priority synergies, co-benefits and trade-offs, opportunities can be identified for better coordinated and integrated policymaking and action. The achievement of a fulfilled human life in cities. It can be highly subjective and dependent on people’s individual circumstances and comprises both material (e.g. food, water and energy security) and non-material (e.g. equity, freedom of choice, enjoyment of natural beauty) dimensions. The capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems to reduce their exposure to, prepare for, cope with, recover better from, adapt to and transform, as necessary, in response to the impacts of climate change. Buildings that have high levels of energy and resource efficiency and reduce environmental impacts across their life cycle. Their users enjoy better health and well-being and productivity gains. In turn this translates into cost savings The way in which cities and national governments can foster more growth that protects environmental quality and creates thriving, low-carbon and climate‑resilient communities that promote economic vitality, health, well-being and social inclusion. Sustainable, large-scale changes in complex adaptive systems (e.g. cities) and their underlying structures and supporting mechanisms (e.g. policies, routines, relationships, resources, power structures and values). An antonym of co-benefits. Disbenefits that arise that have to be weighed up against the direct benefits intended from the main action or measures to improve urban environmental sustainability. The fundamental and structural changes in urban systems through which persistent environmental and societal challenges are addressed. The ease with which people can reach goods, services and activities and connect with one another. In urban areas, accessibility is considered high when households can reach a wide variety of destinations in a short time and at a low cost per unit of travel. Areas, including cities but also smaller urban settlements and suburban areas, developed for residential, industrial or recreational purposes. Urban sustainability from an environmental perspective achieved by focusing on environmental issues in urban areas, such as air and water pollution, green spaces providing space for people and nature, biodiversity loss, resource efficiency, and mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and manage the impacts of climate change. A city’s physical characteristics as determined by physical elements, morphology, buildings, open spaces, expectant zones and the transport infrastructure. Allowing people and goods to move freely and safely in towns and cities while respecting the environment, which is crucial both for quality of life and for the health of the economy. It involves tackling challenges such as traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, air and noise pollution, health issues, safety risks and security threats. Urban, city or town planning is the planning discipline dealing with the physical, social, economic and environmental development of metropolitan regions, municipalities and neighbourhoods. The expression ‘urban planning’ covers developing land use and building plans as well as local building and environmental regulations. Incorporating energy- and resource-efficient technologies and approaches into buildings that also bring co-benefits, such as reducing energy costs and creating healthier buildings for residents. The physical pattern of the low-density expansion of large urban areas into the surrounding agricultural areas under certain market conditions. Sprawl lies in advance of the principal lines of urban growth and implies little planning control of land subdivision. Development is patchy, scattered and strung out, with a tendency to discontinuity because it leap-frogs over some areas, leaving agricultural enclaves. An adaptive process of addressing economic (e.g. economic equity), social (e.g. resilience to climate change impacts), environmental (e.g. reduced air pollution) and governance (e.g. ensuring citizens’ active participation in carrying out urban functions) issues in an integrated way within and beyond urban areas. Multiscale, interdependent, social, natural and engineered systems that affect human and planetary well-being across spatial (local to global) and temporal scales. Urbanisation is a long-term process characterised by both an increasing share of the population living in towns and cities and the growth of urban areas. (Based on Cramer, 2014.) C (Based on McHarg, 1995.) (Based on WHO,1998.) City in which the processes of development include a wide variety of citizens and activities and involve spatial, social and economic inclusion. City that has achieved or is moving towards achieving low-carbon practices in all aspects, including its economy, daily life (e.g. travel), politics and culture. City in which the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems is enabled to survive, adapt and grow in response to chronic stresses and acute shocks. Characteristics, patterns of behaviour and understanding of/attitude to issues shared by a group of people in urban areas and learned by socialisation. All cities have their own specific cultural and historical settings. Actions to achieve urban environmental sustainability need to recognise, adapt to or draw on culture to improve the design and implementation of new policy measures. Data are raw, unorganised facts in various forms on relevant issues, whereas information is data processed, organised and/or structured so as to make it useful for forming knowledge on a subject, issue, event or process relevant to achieving the urban environmental sustainability transition. Accessible, relevant, compatible clearly presented and easy to understand data and information are central for identifying and promoting sustainable urban solutions, and for measuring and monitoring progress towards the urban environmental sustainability transition. (Drawn from Glasgow Caledonian University, 2021.) Management of public/government money and the process of acquiring funds through traditional (e.g. taxes, public-private partnerships) and innovative (e.g. micro-contributions/crowd-funding, land value capture) financial mechanisms to support green investments and the transition to urban environmental sustainability. Note that financing typically refers to how the upfront costs of building infrastructure, etc., are met, while funding refers to how it is paid for it over its life cycle. Access to sufficient, sustainable finance from various sources is necessary to develop, deliver and maintain sustainable and high-quality urban infrastructure and services and to support other programmes or actions for urban environmental sustainability transitions. (Drawn from Institute for Government, 2018.) The interaction between the formal institutions and those in civil society. Governance refers to a process whereby actors in society wield power, authority and influence and enact policies and decisions concerning public life and social upliftment. Public engagement, soft governance, transparency, accountability and integrated decision-making processes involving all relevant sectors, stakeholders (e.g. civil society platforms) and levels of government is crucial to support urban sustainability transitions. (Drawn from Global Development Research Center, 2021.) Key insights into urban environmental sustainability processes and their management and options for action held by individuals within a group or among groups. Knowledge supported by the education system, research, innovation, networks and training is essential to identify appropriate solutions to urban environmental sustainability issues. Tools used to facilitate or support practices, processes and behaviours with different forms and in various areas of technological development, including education, construction, transport, energy, and information and communications. Technological innovation, and making better use of technology, can facilitate sustainability transitions in governance and various sectors by making urban systems more efficient, reducing resource use, supporting better informed decision-making processes, and monitoring the implementation of relevant policies. (All definitions based on EEA, 2021a, 2021b.) Urban systems with the capacity to be resilient, adaptive and responsive to a variety of chronic stresses and acute shocks, reducing vulnerability to climate change and extreme events. High-quality buildings, public spaces and supporting physical infrastructure, such as water supply, energy networks and transport systems, that are built to last, properly integrated with the wider urban system and effectively support sustainable urban living. Community-led and decentralised networks, initiatives and partnerships that foster social innovation and enhance resilience and cohesion. Healthy urban biodiversity, ecology and ecological networks that benefit urban ecosystem services and enhance the resilience of the urban system. Materials and products used efficiently through reuse and recycling with the goal of eliminating the generation of waste. Energy used efficiently to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, reduce energy costs for citizens and cities, and help ensure security of energy supply. An interconnected network of natural and semi-natural areas, green or blue spaces and features that deliver a wide range of benefits to urban citizens while also enhancing biodiversity and helping to restore local ecosystems. An inclusive economy that is low-carbon, resource-conserving, diverse and circular and results in improved human well-being and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. High-quality housing stock that delivers good environmental performance and healthy homes for residents. Integrated, long-term spatial planning and design that delivers healthy, accessible, compact, economically competitive cities and sustainable, multifunctional urban peripheries that also effectively manage urban sprawl. Low energy consumption and demand from citizens and cities, achieved through pro-environmental behaviours and practices that use less energy. Empowerment of stakeholders and citizens in relevant aspects of decision-making and knowledge creation through timely engagement and meaningful participation across all sectors of society. A high proportion of cities’ energy needs produced from decentralised renewable sources ranging from small plants to community and household microgeneration produced close to the point of use. Natural resources used efficiently and operating within the limits of the planet to bring about economic benefits and promote healthier lives and job creation. Justice that protects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and gives them access to a good-quality environment. A well-connected urban environment based on public and active transport accessible to all, including those socially and economically disadvantaged.

There is still considerable uncertainty about the longer-term impacts of the crisis on cities. However, a growing agenda of issues that will have to be tackled in the months and years ahead is emerging. All of the following will have an impact on environmental sustainability transitions in cities: This short briefing is unable to cover all of these important themes in detail. Instead it provides a brief overview of some of the main impacts that the pandemic has had on urban environmental sustainability and then summarises the key opportunities to align the recovery with the urgent transition towards more sustainable cities. There is a growing movement of cities in Europe actively committing to a green recovery from the crisis — supported by initiatives at the EU level such as , and the new . The EU’s ambition to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and its European Green Deal flagship initiative must stay on track. However, the profound societal and economic changes brought about by the crisis need to be recognised. Likewise, we need to ensure an inclusive recovery that recognises that the pandemic has within individual cities and between cities. While current efforts are rightly focused on tackling the immediate challenges of the pandemic, it is important to swiftly put in place approaches to recovery that are aligned with wider sustainability objectives. This will require active participation and full commitment at all levels of government. A central part of these approaches will be ensuring that local governments can play an active role in the recovery planning process at EU and national levels. Funding will also be urgently needed, e.g. by directly for local governments. The economic fallout from COVID-19 has put local governments in a precarious situation in which increased expenditure and reduced revenues have led to major budget shortfalls that could jeopardise existing sustainability initiatives. For all European citizens, the pandemic has resulted in abrupt changes in daily routines that have had far-reaching consequences for cities and the wider sustainability of urban systems. Although the longer-term impacts require further investigation and will differ from one city to another, there are certain patterns that already serve as an important basis for debate and discussion. Figure 1 presents some examples of the key opportunities and challenges that COVID-19 presents for urban environmental sustainability in the immediate term (pandemic response phase) and in the longer term (recovery planning phase). As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold and health concerns remain paramount, cities are already taking the first steps towards recovery and . The aim is to enable cities to rebuild their economies, address complex social justice issues and tackle the climate and ecological crisis at the same time. The following four areas offer particularly promising avenues for confronting this triple crisis in cities. Although they are presented as separate issues here, recent highlights the critical interdependencies between the different urban sectors and systems and the importance of taking an integrated approach that recognises the important nexuses between various urban interventions and the associated policy outcomes. The pandemic allowed policy experiments to be undertaken at a previously unconceivable scale and demonstrated that mobility behaviour in cities is a lot more fluid than perhaps previously assumed. Over the past year, European cities have already created of new cycle lanes, traffic-calming measures and car-free streets. There is an opportunity to build on this momentum by encouraging a modal shift and permanently reallocating road space to walking and cycling — and more green space —thereby avoiding a return to car-dominated cities with . This will require new regulatory interventions that deter car use and encourage the uptake of public transport and active travel. Public transport will and will need special attention, given the major revenue losses that threaten the long-term viability of entire public transport systems. The pandemic also highlighted the importance of ensuring more equitable access to key services. Although most of the underpinning the 15-minute city are not new, the pandemic has clearly increased interest in the concept as a way to improve liveability, reduce carbon emissions and rebuild and future-proof urban communities. If cities are to embrace this model of urban proximity, we will need to reconsider how public and active transport is currently planned. There is a need to move away from radial transport to provide cycling networks that connect residential areas to the urban core and ensure better connections within and between the different areas. Source: C40 Climate Leadership Group, 2020, ‘ ’ . There is a major opportunity for cities to invest in retrofitting their ageing building stock. This can play a central role in supporting the European Green Deal ambition of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and meeting the goals of the new . Collectively, buildings in the EU are responsible for . Building retrofits have considerable co-benefits beyond reducing carbon emissions, including reduced operating costs and more comfortable and healthier buildings for residents. Retrofitting also has , which can help to restart the economy. For example, Lille has announced a , pledging EUR 35 million over the next 3 years for renovating 3 000 social housing units, more than 3 600 private homes and 600 student residences. Beyond green building retrofits, there will also be opportunities for cities to think creatively about repurposing buildings for alternative uses. A drastic reduction in tourist numbers has accelerated plans in some cities, such as Lisbon and Venice, to to affordable housing. Given that the demand for city centre office space may never fully recover, some cities are exploring the potential for converting commercial buildings into housing or other uses. This will require leadership from the public sector and careful planning to ensure an appropriate mix of urban functions and land use and to update regulatory, zoning and taxation policy to enable this shift. The pandemic has certainly underscored the importance of designing . Such buildings can be easily adapted to new uses without having to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch. This supports the EU’s ambition to increase the use of . Urban green infrastructure provides multiple ecosystem services, supports climate change adaptation and plays a key role in improving people’s mental and physical well-being. Perhaps one of the most enduring legacies of the pandemic will be the renewed appreciation of high-quality public green spaces in cities and the importance of , where air, water, soil and other natural resources are protected and nurtured while also increasing cities’ resilience to the effects of climate change. The ability of nature-based solutions to local air quality is particularly relevant, given that evidence now suggests that exacerbated the health impacts of COVID-19. As cities start designing and implementing pathways for recovery from the pandemic, nature-based solutions can provide that create economic opportunities, employment and multiple public health and well-being benefits and have a transformative impact on urban ecosystems. has also highlighted how investments in green infrastructure can help cities adapt to a rapidly changing climate and to the increasingly extreme weather events they have to confront as a result. In planning such interventions, cities will have to consider the , and ensure that those urban communities that currently have the to high-quality public and green spaces are prioritised. It is also important to ensure that urban greening policies are clearly linked to wider issues related to inequities in urban planning and development processes (e.g. uneven access to other urban services such as transport). Linking urban green space policies with other policy objectives, such as an expansion in urban food production, can be an important way of building greater resilience and ensuring that the co-benefits of interventions are maximised. Food security is critical to urban environmental sustainability, and the pandemic has highlighted the importance of having a robust and resilient food system that can withstand sudden crises. The Commission’s strategy seeks to develop a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system. Initiatives such as the and the have created platforms for cities to actively shape more sustainable, inclusive and resilient food systems. The pandemic has given a boost to initiatives embracing the value of growing local, organic and more seasonal food in and around urban areas. For example, Paris is expanding its programme to support local urban farms, and it is explicitly linking access to locally grown food to its 15-minute city model. In Valencia, the has become an immediate and direct source of fresh food for the city. In addition to increasing the availability of healthy produce, urban agriculture also reduces transport distances and the associated carbon emissions and has considerable climate adaptation, ecological, social and health Local food production can also disrupt linear food systems and support cities’ efforts to move towards a more circular consumption model. This may be especially the case where cities also tackle other such as food sourcing, designing and marketing healthier products, and dealing with food waste. Policies to promote local food production will need to consider its affordability for lower-income households, which often lack access to sufficient healthy food and fresh produce. A successful rethinking of urban food systems will therefore require coordinated policy and action across a complex nexus of sectors, including urban agriculture, spatial planning and social policy. The early 2020s are likely to be a key turning point. The fiscal recovery packages and infrastructure investments being rolled out by city and national governments and the EU have the potential either to further entrench fossil fuel-intensive and ecologically damaging economic systems and ‘business as usual’ urbanisation patterns or to accelerate progress towards a zero-carbon, more inclusive future for Europe’s cities. explores some of the drivers and barriers that European cities face in accelerating their transition to more environmentally sustainable patterns. By investing in recovery measures that prioritise zero-carbon transport, energy-efficient buildings, green and blue infrastructure, more space for nature and more resource-efficient urban living, cities can increase their resilience to future crises and ensure a just transition for all of their residents. To be truly inclusive, recovery planning needs to understand and address existing social inequalities within local communities and ensure that the needs of all, including the most vulnerable, are met. Initiatives such as the will be pivotal in placing cities at the centre of the European Green Deal. Cities have been at the forefront of responding to the pandemic, and there is growing recognition that European cities can be powerful agents of change in driving a sustainable recovery. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of both horizontal and vertical coordination of governance and the complex interlinkages between geographies, systems and policy areas. The is a new instrument to strengthen integrated and participatory approaches to sustainable urban development and to provide a stronger link to relevant EU policies and, in particular, cohesion policy investments. EU recovery funding presents a significant opportunity for cities, but only if local governments and local citizens are properly consulted in the planning and execution of recovery initiatives. Co-creating solutions with cities and their networks will be essential in ensuring that transformative actions can be scaled up. Networks and institutions such as , , the , the , (Local Governments for Sustainability), , (Council of European Municipalities and Regions) and others will play a key role in supporting cities on this journey. Opportunities for peer-to-peer learning will remain central to enabling cities to share challenges and lessons learnt in their recovery from the crisis. The Horizon Europe research programme will play a major role in driving innovation in cities with its ambitious goal of . One important legacy of the crisis is likely to be the realisation that behaviours, institutions and even infrastructure can be changed a lot faster than we may have previously assumed. European cities are not as ‘locked in’ to certain ways of doing things as previously thought. If necessary, cities can radically transform how they operate and how we live within them. This has important implications for the ambitions that cities put forward to enable the transformational systems change that will be needed to tackle the climate and ecological crisis in the years to come.

These pollutants contribute to poor air quality, leading to significant negative impacts on human health and the environment.",
        "content": "All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. entered into force on 31 December 2016. Replacing earlier legislation, . The 2016 NEC Directive sets 2020 and 2030 emission reduction commitments for five main air pollutants. The directive transposes the reduction commitments for 2020 agreed by the EU and its Member States under the 2012 revised under the (Air Convention). The more ambitious reduction commitments agreed for 2030 are designed to reduce the health impacts of air pollution by half compared with 2005. Further, the Directive requires that the Member States draw up National Air Pollution Control Programmes that should contribute to the successful implementation of air quality plans established under the EU’s . The NEC Directive highlights the importance of Member States regularly reporting air pollutant emission inventories for assessing progress in reducing air pollution in the EU and for ascertaining whether Member States are in compliance with their commitments. The directive introduces a number of new reporting requirements for Member States. These are defined in Annex I of the directive and include annual information on emissions of a number of pollutants: To ensure that information on emissions reported by Member States is consistent and harmonised with international requirements, the NEC Directive requires Member States to follow the methodologies agreed upon by the UNECE . It also requires that Member States use the k in preparing their inventories. Every year, the EEA publishes an annual status briefing that summarises the most recent reported data and progress of EU Member States in meeting their emission reduction commitments. In 2022, met their respective 2020-2029 commitments under the EU’s National Emission reduction Commitments Directive (NECD) for each of the (nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulphur dioxide and fine particulate matter), according to the EEA assessment. Eleven Member States failed to do so for at least one of five main air pollutants. The latest reported data are made available in an online data viewer and also as a downloadable . EU were required to report a national air pollution control programme (NAPCP) by 1 April 2019. This included policies and measures (PaMs) that Member States selected as relevant for fulfilling their commitments to reduce emissions set for the periods 2020-2029 and from 2030 onwards. Actions taken to reduce emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases often address the same economic sectors but are reported separately under different EU legislation. An overview of the latest policies and measures reported by Member States to tackle air pollution, as required under the National Emission reduction Commitments (NEC) Directive are available . Complete data set on policies and measures reported by Member States can be accessed in the . The NEC Directive establishes a number of flexibilities (Article 5) that Member States may request to be applied for the purposes of assessing compliance with their emission reduction commitments. This includes an ‘adjustment’ process, in which Member States may ‘adjust’ downwards their emission inventories. The adjustment is applied if non-compliance with the national reduction commitments is caused by implementing an improved emission inventory methods in accordance with updated scientific knowledge. Member States wishing to adjust their data in this way must first notify the European Commission (EC) by 15 February each year, and subsequently submit a range of documentation (by 15 March each year) for review and decision by the European Commission."

However, in some European cities air pollution still poses risks to health. You can use the European city air viewer to check and to compare it with air quality in other cities across Europe. Cities are ranked from the cleanest city to the most polluted, based on average concentration levels of fine particulate matter, (or PM ) over the past two calendar years. Fine particulate matter is the air pollutant with the highest impact on health in terms of premature death and disease. This tool is focused on air quality, as long-term exposure to air pollution causes the most serious health effects. In 2021, the , and recommended a maximum level of 5 μg/m for fine particulate matter for exposure in order to protect health. In 2008, the European Union (EU) set an annual limit value for fine particulate matter of 25 μg/m under . The Ambient Air quality is currently under to, among other things, align the EU standards more closely with the WHO recommendations. The viewer categorises air quality as: In Europe, we benefit from the most comprehensive air quality monitoring network in the world. Here we present levels of fine particulate matter in over 350 cities from across . Data comes from on the ground measurements of fine particulate matter, taken by over 500 monitoring stations. If the city is not represented by a dot on the map, it means that the city could not be included in the viewer for one of the two reasons below. The dot representing a city on the map is grey when: Hover on a city on the map to see: The table ranks European cities according to their average levels of fine particulate matter over the past two full calendar years. Using the index to the right, y ou can click on the air quality categories, good, fair, moderate, poor and very poor, to display the cities with air quality in that category. Clicking on a city on the map shows a view of the locations of the PM monitoring stations, regardless of their type, in the city. The stations on the map are represented according to the average concentration of PM for the city as a whole. Hovering on the stations on the map shows: The viewer presents cities as defined by the European Commission’s , in its 2020 edition. This geospatial dataset includes cities with a population of over 50,000 inhabitants. A similar dataset is available for download from the . We use data on concentration of fine particulate matter, or PM reported to the EEA by our member countries under the European Union Ambient Air Quality Directives (2008/50/EC). Two types of data are used. In addition to the information available in the city viewer, a pop-up window provides links to country fact sheets from the Urban PM Atlas, Air Quality in European Cities, 2023 Report, when you select a city on the map. These fact sheets contain detailed insights into the spatial (e.g., urban or national levels) and sectoral (e.g., transport, residential heating, or agriculture) contributions to air pollution in each urban area. They also highlight how targeted local and national measures can effectively reduce fine particulate matter levels, supporting the objectives of the EU’s Zero Pollution Action Plan. Particulate matter is the ambient air pollutant that has been most extensively researched and studies show that PM has one of the highest impact on health in terms of premature death and disease. Long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with the most serious health outcomes, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, along with mortality. To produce this tool, we use data from and air quality monitoring stations that are situated within the boundaries of the cities, as defined by the Urban Audit, and for which countries report data to the EEA. These stations provide a robust picture of the exposure of the population to air pollution in cities. Air quality is also measured at industrial stations and traffic stations. Data from these stations is not used for this tool, as they are used to measure levels in more polluted areas, such as around industrial sites or near motorways and major roads with dense traffic. As such, they measure the exposure of populations around major industrial areas and roads and do not estimate the exposure of the general population. In addition, industrial and traffic stations are unevenly distributed in cities across Europe, which might introduce bias when making comparisons. Nevertheless, concentrations at traffic stations are shown when clicking on the cities, as explained above. Air quality is also monitored in rural areas, with the aim, for instance, of understanding the impacts on crops and natural ecosystem. Rural stations, typically situated far from urban centers, are not included in this tool. For some cities, we do not have data for either step 1 or step 2. In such cases, we use the annual mean for the available year. For data from a station to be included, a minimum of 75% temporal data coverage is required. This means that for an individual station, we consider those with more than 274 valid daily values per calendar year (or 275 days in a leap year). We display five categories of air quality, including good, fair, moderate, poor and very poor. These are defined by bandwidths of concentrations of fine particulate matter, as shown below. In their , the World Health Organization established an annual air quality guideline for PM exposure of 5 μg/m , as well as several interim targets. These values have been used to define the bandwidths for the five categories of air quality. Interim target 1 35 Interim target 2 25 Interim target 3 15 Interim target 4 10 Interim target 5 5 : Adapted from All measurement methods used have a degree of error. In particular, the up-to-date data (dataflow E2a) is not checked for outlying datapoints, which may be errors, and validated by the countries. This may introduce a limited number of more extreme values to the dataset. In reporting the characteristics of monitoring stations to the EEA, countries may interpret the definitions of station types differently. This can reduce comparability between cities. It is assumed that all the urban and suburban monitoring stations in a single city represent background environments equally. The methodology does not account for the distribution of the urban population across the city. Treating stations equally may lead to an underestimate of the average concentration that the general population is exposed to, in the case where the area around a pollution hotspot is densely populated. In large cities with dense urban centres, where large parts of the population reside, stations in the city centre are likely to be traffic stations. Such stations are not included in the methodology, and this may lead to an underestimation of concentrations of fine particulate matter. Only measurements from urban and suburban stations that are in the urban audit geometries are considered in the calculations."

The dramatic reduction in transport volumes linked to the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant but only temporary reductions in emissions, and an upturn in pollution from transportation is already visible for 2021 and 2022 alongside the rebound of transport volumes. Pollutants emitted by transport activities contribute to ambient air pollution and put significant on the environment and human health in Europe. In recent decades, significant policy efforts have addressed transport-related air pollution from various transport modes (road transport, rail, aviation, maritime) and have led to some notable improvements. Together, such policies have delivered progress in reducing the of many pollutants from the transport sector. Between 1990 and 2022, emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO ) from transport across the EU-27 decreased by 51%, sulphur oxides (expressed as SO ) by 82%, carbon monoxide (CO) by 90%, methane (CH ) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by 76% and 91% respectively. In the same time frame, transport emissions of particulate matter (including non-exhaust emissions) with particle diameter of 10µm/2.5µm or less (PM ) decreased by 46%/58%, respectively. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had an influence on these figures, due to the significant reduction in transport volumes during 2020. However, many of the pollutant levels have rebounded. At the same time, two air pollutants have demonstrated in recent decades. Between 1990 and 2022, transport emissions of ammonia (NH ) increased by 121% (138% in 1990-2019) while nitrous oxide (N O) increased by 35%. Although transport contributions of NH emissions are limited compared to other sectors such as agriculture, their impact on air quality, especially within cities, is reported to be very high . While a powerful greenhouse gas, N O is also currently considered a dominant ozone depleting substance . Although most pollutant emissions declined since 1990, the situation is uneven across transport modes. This in part reflects differences in the stringencies of emissions standards. has significantly reduced its pollutant emissions since 1990, with the exception of compounds NH and N O. Their recent increase is mainly due to new catalytic systems for the reduction of NO in diesel engines and the use of enriched fuel mixtures to control NO at high load in petrol engines . While a significant reduction can be seen for both PM and PM , the non-exhaust fraction of these emissions (i.e. from brake and tyre wear or road abrasion) is increasing in percentage and constituted 75% and 59% of PM and PM emissions from road transport in 2022. Non-exhaust emissions will become even more relevant with the progressive decarbonisation of the sector and increases in vehicles mass due to batteries . Emissions from the sector (i.e. including domestic and international), increased for most pollutants, with the exception of CH , CO, NMVOC, rebounding after the significant contraction in traffic volumes that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in emissions since 1990 ranged between 47% and 117%, depending on the compound considered. Differences exist between domestic and international aviation trends for some pollutants (Figure 2). This can be partially explained by the difference in demand evolution and the technology used in domestic and international aviation . The aviation sector's reduction of air pollutant emissions is mainly done at engine design level since the application of advanced aftertreatment systems (as mentioned above) is technologically very challenging. sector emissions from domestic navigation decreased during 1990-2022, for all pollutants considered (excluding CH , which increased by 7%). These reductions range between 88.7% and 0.3%, depending on the compound considered. Conversely, in international navigation most pollutants have increased, aside from PM , PM and SO . This increase in emissions ranged between 5% and 58%, depending on the compound considered. In the maritime sector, many of the pollution reduction technologies already developed in the road sector could in principle be adapted to marine diesel engines. This would yield a significant reduction in air pollutants emissions from the sector with clear environmental benefits. The indicator measures the relative change (in %) in the emissions of different pollutants (CO, NO , NMVOC, SO , NH , CH , N O, PM , PM ) in the transport sector as a whole and for different subsectors. Relative variations were indexed with respect to year 1990 for all pollutants. For CO, NO , NMVOC, SO , NH , PM and PM , data officially reported to the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP)/LRTAP Convention were used. For CH and N O data officially reported under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and also under the Kyoto Protocol (KP) were used. Where a complete time series of emission data has not been reported for CO, NO , NMVOC, SO , NH , PM and PM , data have been gap filled according to the methodologies of the European Environment Agency's (EEA's) European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (ETC/ACC). Details of the gap-filling procedure for the air pollutant data set are described in the EU emission inventory report under the UNECE's Convention on LRTAP. Similarly, for CH and N O additional information on the gap-filling procedure can be found in the Annual European Union greenhouse gas inventory and inventory report Submission to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Additional information on its relative contribution to the overall situation in Europe can be found by consulting the while up-to-date information on air quality in Europe can be found in the . For instance, since 2008, the has set limits or target values for concentrations of pollutants in the ambient air, while the has set emission reduction commitments since 2016 for total national emissions for five air pollutants (NO , SO , NMVOC, NH and PM ). Recently, the European Commission proposed a revision of the , to more closely with WHO guidelines, while putting the EU on a trajectory to achieve the . Emissions from the transport sector are further regulated by and fuel quality requirements . Local and regional air quality , including initiatives such as low-emission zones and congestion charges in cities, are active in many areas. SO and NO emissions from international shipping are regulated by . SO requirements are transposed in EU law by the Directive on sulphur content in certain liquid fuels including marine fuels . Aviation emission of NO and nvPM are regulated at . Transport emissions of ammonia (NH ) and nitrous oxide (N O) are increasing and are of concern: NH emitted within the cities have a very high impact on air quality; N O, beside a powerful greenhouse gas, is also currently considered a dominant ozone depleting substance. Both these pollutants are currently unregulated.

While have declined over recent decades, air pollution levels in Europe are still not safe. are particularly vulnerable to air pollution because their bodies, organs and immune systems are still developing. Air pollution damages health during childhood and increases the risk of disease in later life, according to the EEA ‘ ’ briefing. Air pollution is estimated to cause over every year among those under the age of 18 across the EEA’s 32 member countries. Although the number of premature deaths in this age group is low relative to the , deaths early in life represent a loss of future potential and come with a significant burden of chronic illness, both in childhood and later in life. Children’s lung function and lung development are affected by air pollution, especially by (NO ) in the short term, and by (PM ) in the long term. Maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy is linked to low birth weight and risk of pre-term birth. After birth, ambient air pollution increases the risk of several health problems, including asthma, reduced lung function, respiratory infections and allergies. It also can aggravate chronic conditions like asthma, which afflicts 9% of children and adolescents in Europe, as well as increasing the risk of some chronic diseases later in adulthood. Until air pollution is reduced to safe levels overall, improving air quality around settings like and during activities like school commutes and sports, can help reduce children’s exposure. Air pollution levels across Europe are still unsafe and European air quality policies should aim to protect all citizens, but especially our children, who are most vulnerable to the health impacts of air pollution. It is urgent that we continue to step up measures at EU, national and local level to protect our children, who cannot protect themselves. The surest way to keep them safe is by making the air we all breathe cleaner. In 2021, upwards of was exposed to harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide, ozone and fine particulate matter (PM ). PM is one of the most damaging pollutants to human health, with exposure to PM a leading cause of stroke, cancer and respiratory disease. In 2021, 97% of the urban population was exposed to concentrations of PM above the 2021 WHO annual guideline of 5 µg (microgram) /m . According to preliminary data from 2022, central-eastern Europe and Italy reported the highest concentrations of both PM due primarily to the burning of solid fuels like coal for domestic heating and their use in industry. The EEA briefing ‘ ’ presents the status of concentrations of air pollutants in 2021 and 2022 for regulated pollutants, in relation to both EU air quality standards and the 2021 WHO guideline levels. , Portugal, and the Swedish cities of were ranked as the cleanest European cities and had the lowest average levels of fine particulate matter, or PM , over the past two calendar years, according to the updated EEA city air quality viewer. Cities are ranked from the cleanest city to the most polluted, on the basis of long-term average levels of fine particulate matter. Under the European Green Deal’s , the European Commission set the 2030 goal of reducing the number of premature deaths caused by PM (a key air pollutant) by at least 55% compared with 2005 levels. To this end, the European Commission published in 2022 a proposal to review the ambient air quality directives, aiming, among other things, to align the air quality standards more closely with WHO recommendations. The EEA's highlight pollutants deemed to be or that exceed the EU air quality standards and WHO guideline levels most frequently. The concentrations are obtained from measurements in over 4,500 monitoring stations across Europe that are officially reported to the EEA by its member and other collaborating countries."

However, the most problematic area remains reducing ammonia emissions, emitted mostly by the agriculture sector. The latest annual European Environment Agency (EEA) analysis of air pollution data provided by EU Member States is published today.",
        "content": "All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. In 2021, 13 Member States met their respective 2020-2029 national emission reduction commitments under the EU’s National Emission reduction Commitments Directive (NECD) for each of the five main pollutants (nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulphur dioxide and fine particulate matter) . Thirteen Member States failed to do so for at least one of the five main air pollutants (and one Member States did not report this year). The overall downward trend since 2005 comes despite economic growth over the same period. The EEA briefing is based on the latest available data reported by Member States in 2023 for their 2021 emissions. It describes the progress made towards reducing emissions of the five main air pollutants regulated under the directive. It presents an assessment of Member State performance against the emission reduction commitments for 2020-2029 as well as their progress towards achieving the more ambitious reduction commitments that will apply from 2030 onward. Achieving further reductions for 2030 and beyond will be a significant challenge for nearly all EU countries for nearly all pollutants, as the reduction rate for some pollutant emissions is now levelling off according to the briefing. One exception is sulphur dioxide, where many countries are already compliant with their 2030 reduction commitment. Sulphur dioxide emission contribute to acidification and is responsible for damage to ecosystems and buildings, among other detrimental effects. Reducing ammonia emissions remains the biggest challenge. Ammonia emissions are a concern as they contribute to excessive nitrogen presence in water ecosystems leading to the known phenomenon of eutrophication, among other environmental negative impacts. Ammonia is also a precursor to fine particulate matter, very harmful to health. Ten Member States will have to reduce their ammonia emissions compared to 2021 levels to fulfil their 2020-2029 reduction commitments. The agriculture sector is the principal source, responsible for 93% of total ammonia emissions in the EU. Since 2005, ammonia emissions have only slightly decreased in many Member States and in some cases have even increased. The separate annual EU emission inventory report 1990-2021, also published today by the EEA, showed a continued downward trend in emissions for most main air pollutants, however emissions decreased more slowly from 2007 to 2021. The looks at air pollutant emissions reported by the EU under the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (the Air Convention) and includes a wide range of substances. These include the five main air pollutants (NO , NMVOCs, SO , NH and PM ) but also others such as heavy metals, black carbon or persistent organic pollutants. Under the National Emission reduction Commitments (NEC) directive 2016/2284, EU Member States are required to meet national commitments to reduce emissions for these five air pollutants to deliver clean air for human health and the environment. The EEA analysis is based on the latest air pollutant emission inventory data, as reported by Member States in February 2023 both under the Directive and the UNECE Air Convention."

Further measures to reduce air pollution to WHO guideline levels would prevent these and also reduce the number of people who are living with the debilitating health effects of air pollution-related diseases such as diabetes and asthma. The EEA briefing ‘ assessment presents the latest information, estimated for the year 2021, of the harm to human health caused by : fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone. Between 2005 and 2021, the number of deaths in the EU attributable to (PM ), one of the most damaging air pollutants, fell by 41%. Still, air pollution continues to be the to Europeans (followed by other factors such as exposure to noise, chemicals and the increasing effects of climate-related heatwaves on health), causing chronic illness and attributable deaths, especially in cities and urban areas. According to the latest EEA estimates, were attributable to exposure to (PM ) pollution above the WHO recommended concentration of 5 µg/m . pollution led to 52,000 deaths and short-term exposure to ozone led to 22,000 attributable deaths in the EU. Air pollution also causes ill health and adds significant costs on health care systems. These WHO recommended concentrations are set based on the level of pollution above which there is clear evidence of associated health effects. The figures released today by the EEA remind us that air pollution is still the number one environmental health problem in the EU. The good news is that clean air policy works, and our air quality is improving. But we need to do better still, and bring pollution levels down further. That is why the EU must quickly adopt and implement the proposal for a revised Ambient Air Quality Directive that aims to align EU air quality standards more closely with WHO recommendations. While we have made great strides over past years to reduce air pollution levels, our latest data and assessment show that the , resulting in deaths and illnesses which can be attributed to air pollution. The positive news is that authorities at European, national and local levels are taking action to reduce emissions through measures like promoting public transport or cycling in city centres, and through updated legislation. New in this year’s assessment is the quantification of the to which air pollution contributes. The total health burden associated with each of these diseases depends not only on the attributable deaths linked to the disease but also on the health burden of living with the effects of the disease on a daily basis. For some diseases such as the majority of the health burden is linked to attributable deaths, but for other diseases such as diabetes and asthma there is also a significant health burden associated with living with the debilitating health effects of these diseases, typically over many years or decades. Therefore, when we consider the health effects of air pollution, it is important not only to focus on attributable deaths but also on the that these diseases can have on the of European citizens as they cope with the long-term effects of diseases such as asthma. Of the considered air pollution-related illnesses, for exposure to (PM ), the greatest health burden is caused by ischemic heart disease, followed by stroke, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and asthma. In the case of and the three diseases considered, the highest health burden was caused by diabetes mellitus, followed by stroke and asthma.

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing Protecting children’s health is frequently cited as a key objective in major policies on climate and the environment such as the zero pollution action plan (European Commission, 2020). Though most children across EEA member countries are healthy (Eurostat, 2019; WHO, 2023), there are reasons for concern regarding environmental risks to their health. Children and adolescents are more susceptible than adults to most adverse environmental factors; in some cases they may be more exposed than adults too (Valent et al., 2004); and they can do little to change the situation or protect themselves. That is especially true for air pollution, the largest environmental risk for children in Europe. There are many factors that make children and adolescents especially vulnerable to air pollution. Children’s breathing rates are higher than those of adults and they also take in more air per kilogram of body weight. Because of their lower physical height, they breathe air closer to the ground where some pollutants, especially from traffic exhausts, are emitted and become concentrated. Their acquired dose of pollution is also elevated since they breathe faster and are often more physically active (Osborne et al., 2021). Moreover, children inhale a larger fraction of air through their mouths than adults. Due to this increased oral breathing, pollution penetrates deep into the lower respiratory tract, which is more permeable (US EPA, 2019). Children’s bodies and organs, including their lungs, are also still in development (Chen et al., 2015), which further increases risk. Furthermore, children’s developing immune systems are weaker than those of adults, strengthening the effects of pollution (WHO, 2018). Air pollution is the contamination of indoor or outdoor air by any agent that modifies its natural characteristics. It comes from both natural and, particularly, man-made sources, which include everything from road traffic and residential heating exhausts, through to factory chimney stacks and a wide variety of other sources (EEA, 2022a, 2022c). Air pollution affects urban and rural areas, and comes in many forms, from ambient air particles, ozone and nitrogen oxides, to second-hand smoke (SHS), smoke from the burning of biomass in households, mould spores, mites and allergens, and toxic chemicals like formaldehyde (Trasande et al., 2016; Carreras et al., 2019; Rojas-Rueda et al., 2019; WHO, 2022). Some of the aforementioned pollutants and sources are more frequent or found at higher concentrations indoors. They are the subject of ongoing research at the EEA and findings will be summarised in forthcoming publications. Boxes 1 and 2 in this briefing provide some highlights on indoor air pollutants. This briefing however focuses on outdoor ambient air pollution, a term that is used interchangeably with ‘air pollution’ hereafter. Depending on the pollutant, different sources of ambient air pollution are the main drivers of exposure, as illustrated in Figure 2 below (EEA, 2022b). : EEA (2022a) . NMVOC: non-methane volatile organic compounds; NO : nitrogen oxides; PM : particles with a diameter smaller than 2,5 microns; PM : particles with a diameter smaller than 10 microns; SO : sulphur dioxide. Children’s and adolescents’ exposure to air pollutants partly mimics that of adults, but it also differs in specific ways. Children are already exposed to air pollution while in their mothers’ wombs, and after birth they are typically exposed to air pollution in child-centric settings such as: outside in the grounds of schools and kindergartens; in classrooms where ambient air pollution worsens indoor air quality; and during activities like commuting to school and afterschool activities. Smaller children are also exposed to air pollution closer to the ground, where the concentrations of some pollutants are higher. Children and adolescents tend to spend more time outdoors and are more physically active than adults, potentially increasing their exposure to ambient air pollution. In addition, as is the case with other environmental risks, poorer children tend to be systematically more exposed to and affected by air pollution (Fairburn et al., 2019) than their better-off counterparts. Children are affected by ambient air pollutants from the womb through to adulthood. Every year in EEA member and collaborating countries, air pollution is estimated to cause over 1,200 deaths and the loss of over 110,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs, a measure of the burden of disease caused by a risk factor) among those aged under 18 (GBD Collaborative Network, 2020). These deaths, along with a significant burden from non-fatal diseases, are caused by air pollution through a variety of mechanisms and health outcomes, which are explored below. Before birth, ambient air pollution increases the risk of babies being smaller during pregnancy (a condition known as ‘small for gestational age’, or SGA) (Pun et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Nyadanu et al., 2022), having a low birth weight (Yang et al., 2020; Ghosh et al., 2021) as well as having an increased risk of pre-term birth (US EPA, 2020; Nyadanu et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022). All of these can increase the risk of different health problems later in life. Though the evidence is less clear, particulate matter has also been linked to an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and still births (Grippo et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2022). Despite solid epidemiological data, the biological mechanisms are not fully understood for most of the pre-natal risks of air pollution. After birth, ambient air pollution increases the risk of several types of adverse health outcomes for children and adolescents. For example, it increases the risk of respiratory infections in children, including acute lower respiratory infections, pneumonia, upper respiratory infections and otitis media (ear infections) (Mehta et al., 2013; Nhung et al., 2017; Bowatte et al., 2018; King et al., 2018; Låg et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Ziou et al., 2022). Short-term exposure to air pollution may also exacerbate allergies, including allergic rhinitis (runny nose), eczema and conjunctivitis (itchy eyes) in children (US EPA, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020). Children’s lung function and lung development are also affected by ambient air pollution, especially by ozone and nitrogen dioxide (NO ) in the short term, and by fine particles (PM ) in the long term. This effect can be seen both in healthy children and also in children with asthma, which can be exacerbated by pollution (US EPA, 2010, 2017, 2019, 2020; WHO, 2018, 2021a; Garcia et al., 2021; Holm and Balmes, 2022). Asthma affects over 9% of children in the EU (Selroos et al., 2015), placing a large burden on children, their families and societies. The risk of developing asthma itself and asthma-like symptoms is clearly linked to long-term exposure to air pollution (US EPA, 2010, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020; Zu et al., 2018; Låg et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Bettiol et al., 2021; Han et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022). This has been observed both in epidemiological studies and in the laboratory, where the mechanisms for this effect have been studied and confirmed. Asthma symptoms can range from mild to very severe, even life-threatening. Exposure to short term increases in air pollution increases the risk of asthma hospitalisation and emergency department visits for children (Mustafić et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2016; US EPA, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022). Ambient air pollution may also be linked to other types of health problems in children. For example, there is growing evidence that air pollution affects children’s brain development, contributes to cognitive impairment, and that it may play a role in the development of some types of Autistic Spectrum Disorders (US EPA, 2015, 2019, 2020; Dutheil et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Lin et al., 2022). Some studies have also observed a link between traffic-related air pollution, with benzene playing a key role, and leukaemia in children (Orsini et al., 2012; Filippini et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021). In addition to ambient air pollution from traffic, heating, industry, etc., children’s health is also threatened by other airborne pollutants, like second-hand smoke and chemicals. Children can be exposed to these pollutants both outdoors and indoors. Indoor air pollution (IAP): European children spend most of their time indoors, and indoor air pollution can significantly affect their health and well-being. Sources of IAP include: some building products and furnishings that release toxic chemicals; materials like some mineral fibres and legacy-asbestos still remaining in buildings; natural pollutants like radioactive radon. Outdoor air pollution also contributes to indoor air pollution, as does smoking, burning candles, allergens and dust, among others. Two types of air pollutants are of particular importance indoors: mould, and several types of toxic chemicals. Mould is a frequent indoor health hazard for adults and children alike, for whom it increases the risk of developing asthma, asthma exacerbation, wheeze, allergic rhinitis, and respiratory infections (Gern et al., 1999; Dick et al., 2014; Tham et al., 2014; Kanchongkittiphon et al., 2015; Sharpe et al., 2015; Hurraß et al., 2017; Fakunle et al., 2020, 2021). The concentrations of certain chemicals that are toxic for adults and children, such as formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds (VOC), flame retardants, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) tend to be much higher in indoor air. However, our knowledge of the sources, concentrations, status of, and trends in indoor air pollution in Europe lags far behind that of outdoor air pollution. Second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS): there is no safe level of SHS exposure, and children are particularly vulnerable to it both before and after birth (Öberg et al., 2010). About 12% of European children are regularly exposed to SHS at home (Carreras et al., 2020), and socially disadvantaged children and adolescents are also more likely to be exposed to SHS at home (59%) than children of parents with high socioeconomic status (21%) (Kuntz and Lampert, 2016). In children, SHS is estimated to cause up to 13% of all new cases of asthma, 20% of lower respiratory infections, 15% of cases of otitis media, and over 20% of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Öberg et al., 2010, 2011; Hänninen et al., 2011; Carreras et al., 2019, 2020; GBD Collaborative Network, 2020). The exposure of children to toxic chemicals in Europe, mould, SHS, and poor indoor air quality are the subject of current work at the EEA, to be released in forthcoming publications. Additional information on indoor air quality is available as part of the EEA’s and the WHO guidelines for indoor air quality concerning , , and . Good progress has been made towards reducing air pollution from industry, transport, and homes — thereby reducing the number of deaths of all ages linked to air pollution as a result. In the EU-27, total emissions of all pollutants have consistently declined from 2005 to 2020 (the latest year with validated data). Figure 3 shows the trend in total emissions of particularly harmful air pollutants, indexed as a percentage of their value in the reference year 2005. Though the decline of all pollutants is good news, the decline of particulate matter, both PM and PM , is of special importance, given their overall impact on the health of Europeans. : EEA (2022b) . These facts were already highlighted by the EEA and WHO Europe 20 years ago (EEA and WHO Europe et al., 2003) and are still true today. Policies and interventions targeting air pollutants can be categorised according to whether they aim at reducing emissions (prevention), reducing concentrations (mitigation) or avoiding individual exposure (avoidance) (Public Health England, 2019). There are entire catalogues of existing and proposed policies and interventions within these categories (Burns et al., 2020), including those mentioned in this briefing. To ensure that air pollution policies and interventions adequately protect children and adolescents, it is important that they explicitly acknowledge and integrate the different exposures and biology of these groups, rather than treating them implicitly as little adults. Ideally, air pollution decisions and policies should be informed by specific risk assessments to children’s health, while also setting out a clear framework to protect children and adolescents from polluted air at the places and settings where they are most at risk, including prenatally. Involving the groups and institutions involved in childcare, education and health, as well as encouraging the engagement of parents and/or caregivers can promote buy-in and foster success. Reducing the concentration of air pollutants will help protect all Europeans, including children. However, until air pollution is reduced to safer levels, preventing exposure is the most effective way of protecting children’s health. Ultimately, all air pollution policies designed to reduce exposure ought to be implemented down to local levels of government, where the exposures actually occur. The examples of good practices listed in this briefing are only a subset of possible policies, focused mostly on avoidance (i.e. reducing exposure to air pollution). They are highlighted because they are highly local and actionable, and they focus on an easily identifiable context where children are exposed to air pollution: within care and educational settings. Locally, where exposures occur, certain good practices can be considered to reduce exposures in children. Frequently, these good practices focus on the different microenvironments where children spend most of their time: home, schools/kindergartens (including school gates, drop-off zones, classrooms and playgrounds), indoor and outdoor activities which are neither at home nor at school, and transport including school commutes. Air pollution concentrations in school grounds, playgrounds and drop-off points are heavily influenced by proximity to nearby roads, traffic density and traffic flow (Rivas et al., 2018; Boniardi et al., 2021; Osborne et al., 2021). For example, in a recent study the concentration of PM was found to intensify by approximately a factor of three at the school entrance during drop-off hours, as cars queued (Kumar et al., 2020). Reducing ambient air pollution around schools can contribute significantly to reducing the dose of air pollutants inhaled by schoolchildren daily. This reduction can be achieved in various ways. . Establishing ‘clean air zones’ around schools can reduce the concentration of pollutants found around them. Lower pollution levels can be achieved through restrictions on traffic, such as no-idling zones around schools (Ryan et al., 2013; Rumchev et al., 2021; Mendoza et al., 2022), ‘school streets’ (i.e. with a traffic ban at the start and end of the school day in the immediate vicinity of the school), or relocation of drop off/pick-up points away from school entrances (Davis, 2020; Den Hond et al., 2020; Koppen et al., 2020; van Poppel et al. 2020 Huertas-Delgado et al., 2022). . If a school is still in the planning stage, children’s exposure to air pollution can be reduced by placing the school away from pollution sources or hotspots of high air pollution, as already mandated in various European countries (NICE, 2017; Rijkswaterstaat Environment, 2022; Senatsverwaltung für Umwelt, Mobilität, Verbraucher- und Klimaschutz, 2022). This principle should be applied cautiously, however, as the location of a school influences the primary modes of travel to and from it (An et al., 2021). A school built at a site with better air quality might be further away from housing areas, thus requiring a commute by motorised transport which could in turn lead to higher exposure levels at the school. A school located closer to the children’s housing, meanwhile, may be reachable on foot or by bike, reducing traffic and leading to better air quality in the vicinity. Commuting modes and routes are another area of action where good practices can reduce exposure. For example, when the same home-school route is taken by children walking and commuting by car, the pedestrians experience a higher dose of pollutants. However, by taking an alternative background route or avoiding proximity to traffic queues, pedestrians can lower their dose. In fact, studies show that pedestrians may be willing to change their route when presented with pollution information (Dirks et al., 2016; de Nazelle et al., 2017; Rafiepourgatabi et al., 2021; Wolfe et al., 2021), switching to alternative routes with less exposure (‘background routes’). More children walking to school also reduces motorised traffic and the resulting pollution from private vehicles. Placing schools away from high-volume roads and within a walkable distance from home can benefit children’s health via a lower exposure to air pollution (An et al., 2021), particularly when background routes are used. It can also benefit children’s health through increased physical activity (Chillón et al., 2015) — an important consideration given that in most situations the benefits of physical activity outweigh the risks of air pollution (Tainio et al., 2021). Ultimately however, economic, social, and other considerations may preclude altering the siting of schools or changing commuting modes. . The design of school and childcare facilities can contribute to minimising the exposure of children to air pollution while onsite. This may entail locating the most frequented rooms or areas as far away from road traffic as possible, shielding the playground behind buildings, walls or green infrastructure (i.e. using plants), and allowing natural ventilation patterns that promote pollutant dispersion (An et al., 2021). At the same time, care must be taken to avoid unfiltered ventilation when there are high pollution levels outdoors near the school. Green infrastructure can filter some air pollutants and alter the airflow — thus changing pollution concentrations in local microenvironments (Abhijith et al., 2017). The type, height and porosity of vegetation heavily influences this cleaning effect, but various solutions from ivy screens to hedge fences have proved effective locally (Tremper et al., 2015: Tremper and Green, 2018; Tomson et al., 2021; Redondo-Bermúdez et al., 2022). Beyond their air quality enhancing effect, green infrastructure in and around schools provides multiple social and environmental co-benefits, including cooling, sun protection, opportunities for physical activity, water storage, habitat conservation, etc. (Redondo-Bermúdez et al., 2022). Nevertheless, the level of greening around schools in urban areas in Europe is low. On average, just over 10% of the area within a 300m radius of educational facilities is green, and only 6% is covered by trees (EEA, 2023). Schools with the greenest surroundings tend to be in northern Europe (Figure 4). EEA (2023) . Children spend many hours indoors at school and kindergartens, so measures to reduce indoor air pollution in those spaces are crucial to reduce their overall exposure. Reducing toxic chemicals and mould is crucial for good indoor air quality in schools. Establishing regulations to improve indoor air quality and limit values for common air pollutants in places where sensitive populations gather is a crucial start (Vlaamse Regering, 2004; Lowther et al., 2021; UBA, 2023; Gouvernement de France, 2022). Clear sources of exposure to indoor air pollutants such as cleaning, painting, etc. should be organised to minimise children’s exposure, by scheduling them to take place after school hours, using low-emission cleaning products and materials, prioritising wet cleaning, fitting vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters, minimising the use of toxic chemicals, and using technologies like sorptive boards (surfaces engineered to trap certain pollutants) and CO monitoring in classrooms as an indicator of indoor air quality. In most school settings, outdoor air quality can be better than indoor air quality on several parameters, and ventilation is a prime tool to improve indoor air quality in classrooms and laboratories. It lowers CO levels and the risk of aerosol-transmitted diseases, removes moisture (and associated mould risks — see below), as well as odours and toxic chemicals from construction products, furniture and cleaning agents (Fisk, 2017; Aguilar et al., 2022). Ventilation of buildings can be improved by: (1) opening windows and doors to bring in ambient air, (2) using heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) devices, and ensuring exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens are working properly, and (3) communicating necessary background knowledge and instructions to students, parents, faculty and staff (Beregszaszi et al., 2013; European Commission et al., 2014; Baldauf et al., 2015; Jhun et al., 2017; Rivas et al., 2018; Thevenet et al., 2018; Brand et al., 2019; WHO Europe, 2022). Mould only grows when there is sufficient moisture, so detecting sources of moisture is the first step to controlling it. Leaking pipes, overflows, rain seeping through cracks or gaps in roofs, spills from blocked gutters, leaky window frames and rising damp are frequent causes of excess moisture, often leaving ‘tidemarks’ that should be interpreted as warning signs for mould. Another typical source of moisture is condensation, due to high humidity indoors and worsened by low temperatures and poor ventilation. Such sources of moisture should be eliminated, and any dampness removed via ventilation, dehumidifiers, etc. Thereafter, mould should be removed from affected areas. If the mould-affected area is large, or mould is present in the building structure and materials, removal should be done by qualified professionals, according to local and national standards. Finally, to stop mould and dampness from reoccurring, basic prevention measures should be undertaken including opening windows daily, using fans in bathrooms and kitchens, maintaining mechanical ventilation where installed, watching for and repairing leaks, and avoiding condensation on cold surfaces (WHO Europe, 2009; WHO, 2022). . The reduction of smoking in all its forms, especially in child-centric settings such as in and around schools and kindergartens, is of key importance to reduce children’s overall exposure to SHS, despite the fact that it can also occur at home, in vehicles and elsewhere. Exposure to SHS has been observed to be significantly reduced by implementing smoking bans in all public places (Liang et al., 2016; El Sharkawy et al., 2021; Laverty et al., 2021; Nogueira et al., 2022). A recent study in Germany (Burkhardt et al., 2023) measured an 82% decline in a biomarker of tobacco smoke in the urine of non-smokers from 1995 to 2019, and largely attributes this to smoking bans and regulations limiting SHS following European legislation. Bans can benefit children when implemented with a special emphasis and consistent enforcement in and around schools and kindergartens. Interventions establishing family rules for smoke free vehicles (e.g. when commuting to school), smoking counselling to parents or caregivers, strict enforcement of complete tobacco bans in and around schools, and awareness campaigns against SHS have all shown to work in reducing children’s exposure to SHS (Blaakman et al., 2013; Bunik et al., 2013; Sharifi et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2015, 2020; Hoehn et al., 2016; Mason et al., 2016; Caldwell et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2018; Turner et al., 2020). More evidence on SHS impacts on children and good practices to reduce exposure will be published in forthcoming EEA products. In addition to the good practices considered above, there is a wide range of local measures that can help protect the general population against air pollution. Well-informed residents are generally in a better position to demand action on air pollution and protect themselves from it. Two key EEA products can help citizens understand more about the air quality where they live. The European Environment Agency’s gives near-real time assessments of air quality for more than 3,500 air quality monitoring stations across Europe. The allows citizens to check how the air quality was in their city over the past 2 years and to compare it with air quality in other cities across Europe. While reducing European children’s and adolescents’ exposure to air pollution is crucial and urgent, the surest way to keep them safe in the long term is by making the air we all breathe cleaner. The EU bases its clean air policy on three main pillars: (1) the (EU, 2016); (2) source-specific legislation for key sources of air pollution (European Commission, 2022a); and (3) the Ambient Air Quality Directives (EU, 2004, 2008), which set air quality standards (EEA, 2021). In October 2022, the European Commission published a , including the following key measures (EEA, 2022a): The above measures are aligned with other legislative proposals, such as the revision of the and recent proposals on for road vehicles, which will support the achievement of stricter air quality standards. They are key to achieving one of the goals of the zero pollution action plan: reducing by 2030 the number of premature deaths caused by exposure to PM by at least 55% compared with 2005 levels (European Commission, 2022b). In the international context, the EU Member States work closely with other UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) member countries to control international air pollution under the UNECE . It should be noted that achieving the goals and air pollution levels set forth by current EU policies and regulation will still not mean that the air in Europe is safe for children and adolescents. For example, there is no evidence of a safe level or a threshold of exposure to PM below which no adverse health effects occur, and in the past research has tended to detect health impacts of air pollution at progressively lower levels. This notwithstanding, air in Europe which is cleaner overall will significantly contribute to making our children and adolescents healthier. Abhijith, K.

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing Protecting children’s health is frequently cited as a key objective in major policies on climate and the environment such as the zero pollution action plan (European Commission, 2020). Though most children across EEA member countries are healthy (Eurostat, 2019; WHO, 2023), there are reasons for concern regarding environmental risks to their health. Children and adolescents are more susceptible than adults to most adverse environmental factors; in some cases they may be more exposed than adults too (Valent et al., 2004); and they can do little to change the situation or protect themselves. That is especially true for air pollution, the largest environmental risk for children in Europe. There are many factors that make children and adolescents especially vulnerable to air pollution. Children’s breathing rates are higher than those of adults and they also take in more air per kilogram of body weight. Because of their lower physical height, they breathe air closer to the ground where some pollutants, especially from traffic exhausts, are emitted and become concentrated. Their acquired dose of pollution is also elevated since they breathe faster and are often more physically active (Osborne et al., 2021). Moreover, children inhale a larger fraction of air through their mouths than adults. Due to this increased oral breathing, pollution penetrates deep into the lower respiratory tract, which is more permeable (US EPA, 2019). Children’s bodies and organs, including their lungs, are also still in development (Chen et al., 2015), which further increases risk. Furthermore, children’s developing immune systems are weaker than those of adults, strengthening the effects of pollution (WHO, 2018). Air pollution is the contamination of indoor or outdoor air by any agent that modifies its natural characteristics. It comes from both natural and, particularly, man-made sources, which include everything from road traffic and residential heating exhausts, through to factory chimney stacks and a wide variety of other sources (EEA, 2022a, 2022c). Air pollution affects urban and rural areas, and comes in many forms, from ambient air particles, ozone and nitrogen oxides, to second-hand smoke (SHS), smoke from the burning of biomass in households, mould spores, mites and allergens, and toxic chemicals like formaldehyde (Trasande et al., 2016; Carreras et al., 2019; Rojas-Rueda et al., 2019; WHO, 2022). Some of the aforementioned pollutants and sources are more frequent or found at higher concentrations indoors. They are the subject of ongoing research at the EEA and findings will be summarised in forthcoming publications. Boxes 1 and 2 in this briefing provide some highlights on indoor air pollutants. This briefing however focuses on outdoor ambient air pollution, a term that is used interchangeably with ‘air pollution’ hereafter. Depending on the pollutant, different sources of ambient air pollution are the main drivers of exposure, as illustrated in Figure 2 below (EEA, 2022b). : EEA (2022a) . NMVOC: non-methane volatile organic compounds; NO : nitrogen oxides; PM : particles with a diameter smaller than 2,5 microns; PM : particles with a diameter smaller than 10 microns; SO : sulphur dioxide. Children’s and adolescents’ exposure to air pollutants partly mimics that of adults, but it also differs in specific ways. Children are already exposed to air pollution while in their mothers’ wombs, and after birth they are typically exposed to air pollution in child-centric settings such as: outside in the grounds of schools and kindergartens; in classrooms where ambient air pollution worsens indoor air quality; and during activities like commuting to school and afterschool activities. Smaller children are also exposed to air pollution closer to the ground, where the concentrations of some pollutants are higher. Children and adolescents tend to spend more time outdoors and are more physically active than adults, potentially increasing their exposure to ambient air pollution. In addition, as is the case with other environmental risks, poorer children tend to be systematically more exposed to and affected by air pollution (Fairburn et al., 2019) than their better-off counterparts. Children are affected by ambient air pollutants from the womb through to adulthood. Every year in EEA member and collaborating countries, air pollution is estimated to cause over 1,200 deaths and the loss of over 110,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs, a measure of the burden of disease caused by a risk factor) among those aged under 18 (GBD Collaborative Network, 2020). These deaths, along with a significant burden from non-fatal diseases, are caused by air pollution through a variety of mechanisms and health outcomes, which are explored below. Before birth, ambient air pollution increases the risk of babies being smaller during pregnancy (a condition known as ‘small for gestational age’, or SGA) (Pun et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Nyadanu et al., 2022), having a low birth weight (Yang et al., 2020; Ghosh et al., 2021) as well as having an increased risk of pre-term birth (US EPA, 2020; Nyadanu et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022). All of these can increase the risk of different health problems later in life. Though the evidence is less clear, particulate matter has also been linked to an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and still births (Grippo et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2022). Despite solid epidemiological data, the biological mechanisms are not fully understood for most of the pre-natal risks of air pollution. After birth, ambient air pollution increases the risk of several types of adverse health outcomes for children and adolescents. For example, it increases the risk of respiratory infections in children, including acute lower respiratory infections, pneumonia, upper respiratory infections and otitis media (ear infections) (Mehta et al., 2013; Nhung et al., 2017; Bowatte et al., 2018; King et al., 2018; Låg et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Ziou et al., 2022). Short-term exposure to air pollution may also exacerbate allergies, including allergic rhinitis (runny nose), eczema and conjunctivitis (itchy eyes) in children (US EPA, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020). Children’s lung function and lung development are also affected by ambient air pollution, especially by ozone and nitrogen dioxide (NO ) in the short term, and by fine particles (PM ) in the long term. This effect can be seen both in healthy children and also in children with asthma, which can be exacerbated by pollution (US EPA, 2010, 2017, 2019, 2020; WHO, 2018, 2021a; Garcia et al., 2021; Holm and Balmes, 2022). Asthma affects over 9% of children in the EU (Selroos et al., 2015), placing a large burden on children, their families and societies. The risk of developing asthma itself and asthma-like symptoms is clearly linked to long-term exposure to air pollution (US EPA, 2010, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020; Zu et al., 2018; Låg et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Bettiol et al., 2021; Han et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022). This has been observed both in epidemiological studies and in the laboratory, where the mechanisms for this effect have been studied and confirmed. Asthma symptoms can range from mild to very severe, even life-threatening. Exposure to short term increases in air pollution increases the risk of asthma hospitalisation and emergency department visits for children (Mustafić et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2016; US EPA, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022). Ambient air pollution may also be linked to other types of health problems in children. For example, there is growing evidence that air pollution affects children’s brain development, contributes to cognitive impairment, and that it may play a role in the development of some types of Autistic Spectrum Disorders (US EPA, 2015, 2019, 2020; Dutheil et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Lin et al., 2022). Some studies have also observed a link between traffic-related air pollution, with benzene playing a key role, and leukaemia in children (Orsini et al., 2012; Filippini et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021). In addition to ambient air pollution from traffic, heating, industry, etc., children’s health is also threatened by other airborne pollutants, like second-hand smoke and chemicals. Children can be exposed to these pollutants both outdoors and indoors. Indoor air pollution (IAP): European children spend most of their time indoors, and indoor air pollution can significantly affect their health and well-being. Sources of IAP include: some building products and furnishings that release toxic chemicals; materials like some mineral fibres and legacy-asbestos still remaining in buildings; natural pollutants like radioactive radon. Outdoor air pollution also contributes to indoor air pollution, as does smoking, burning candles, allergens and dust, among others. Two types of air pollutants are of particular importance indoors: mould, and several types of toxic chemicals. Mould is a frequent indoor health hazard for adults and children alike, for whom it increases the risk of developing asthma, asthma exacerbation, wheeze, allergic rhinitis, and respiratory infections (Gern et al., 1999; Dick et al., 2014; Tham et al., 2014; Kanchongkittiphon et al., 2015; Sharpe et al., 2015; Hurraß et al., 2017; Fakunle et al., 2020, 2021). The concentrations of certain chemicals that are toxic for adults and children, such as formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds (VOC), flame retardants, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) tend to be much higher in indoor air. However, our knowledge of the sources, concentrations, status of, and trends in indoor air pollution in Europe lags far behind that of outdoor air pollution. Second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS): there is no safe level of SHS exposure, and children are particularly vulnerable to it both before and after birth (Öberg et al., 2010). About 12% of European children are regularly exposed to SHS at home (Carreras et al., 2020), and socially disadvantaged children and adolescents are also more likely to be exposed to SHS at home (59%) than children of parents with high socioeconomic status (21%) (Kuntz and Lampert, 2016). In children, SHS is estimated to cause up to 13% of all new cases of asthma, 20% of lower respiratory infections, 15% of cases of otitis media, and over 20% of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Öberg et al., 2010, 2011; Hänninen et al., 2011; Carreras et al., 2019, 2020; GBD Collaborative Network, 2020). The exposure of children to toxic chemicals in Europe, mould, SHS, and poor indoor air quality are the subject of current work at the EEA, to be released in forthcoming publications. Additional information on indoor air quality is available as part of the EEA’s and the WHO guidelines for indoor air quality concerning , , and . Good progress has been made towards reducing air pollution from industry, transport, and homes — thereby reducing the number of deaths of all ages linked to air pollution as a result. In the EU-27, total emissions of all pollutants have consistently declined from 2005 to 2020 (the latest year with validated data). Figure 3 shows the trend in total emissions of particularly harmful air pollutants, indexed as a percentage of their value in the reference year 2005. Though the decline of all pollutants is good news, the decline of particulate matter, both PM and PM , is of special importance, given their overall impact on the health of Europeans. : EEA (2022b) . These facts were already highlighted by the EEA and WHO Europe 20 years ago (EEA and WHO Europe et al., 2003) and are still true today. Policies and interventions targeting air pollutants can be categorised according to whether they aim at reducing emissions (prevention), reducing concentrations (mitigation) or avoiding individual exposure (avoidance) (Public Health England, 2019). There are entire catalogues of existing and proposed policies and interventions within these categories (Burns et al., 2020), including those mentioned in this briefing. To ensure that air pollution policies and interventions adequately protect children and adolescents, it is important that they explicitly acknowledge and integrate the different exposures and biology of these groups, rather than treating them implicitly as little adults. Ideally, air pollution decisions and policies should be informed by specific risk assessments to children’s health, while also setting out a clear framework to protect children and adolescents from polluted air at the places and settings where they are most at risk, including prenatally. Involving the groups and institutions involved in childcare, education and health, as well as encouraging the engagement of parents and/or caregivers can promote buy-in and foster success. Reducing the concentration of air pollutants will help protect all Europeans, including children. However, until air pollution is reduced to safer levels, preventing exposure is the most effective way of protecting children’s health. Ultimately, all air pollution policies designed to reduce exposure ought to be implemented down to local levels of government, where the exposures actually occur. The examples of good practices listed in this briefing are only a subset of possible policies, focused mostly on avoidance (i.e. reducing exposure to air pollution). They are highlighted because they are highly local and actionable, and they focus on an easily identifiable context where children are exposed to air pollution: within care and educational settings. Locally, where exposures occur, certain good practices can be considered to reduce exposures in children. Frequently, these good practices focus on the different microenvironments where children spend most of their time: home, schools/kindergartens (including school gates, drop-off zones, classrooms and playgrounds), indoor and outdoor activities which are neither at home nor at school, and transport including school commutes. Air pollution concentrations in school grounds, playgrounds and drop-off points are heavily influenced by proximity to nearby roads, traffic density and traffic flow (Rivas et al., 2018; Boniardi et al., 2021; Osborne et al., 2021). For example, in a recent study the concentration of PM was found to intensify by approximately a factor of three at the school entrance during drop-off hours, as cars queued (Kumar et al., 2020). Reducing ambient air pollution around schools can contribute significantly to reducing the dose of air pollutants inhaled by schoolchildren daily. This reduction can be achieved in various ways. . Establishing ‘clean air zones’ around schools can reduce the concentration of pollutants found around them. Lower pollution levels can be achieved through restrictions on traffic, such as no-idling zones around schools (Ryan et al., 2013; Rumchev et al., 2021; Mendoza et al., 2022), ‘school streets’ (i.e. with a traffic ban at the start and end of the school day in the immediate vicinity of the school), or relocation of drop off/pick-up points away from school entrances (Davis, 2020; Den Hond et al., 2020; Koppen et al., 2020; van Poppel et al. 2020 Huertas-Delgado et al., 2022). . If a school is still in the planning stage, children’s exposure to air pollution can be reduced by placing the school away from pollution sources or hotspots of high air pollution, as already mandated in various European countries (NICE, 2017; Rijkswaterstaat Environment, 2022; Senatsverwaltung für Umwelt, Mobilität, Verbraucher- und Klimaschutz, 2022). This principle should be applied cautiously, however, as the location of a school influences the primary modes of travel to and from it (An et al., 2021). A school built at a site with better air quality might be further away from housing areas, thus requiring a commute by motorised transport which could in turn lead to higher exposure levels at the school. A school located closer to the children’s housing, meanwhile, may be reachable on foot or by bike, reducing traffic and leading to better air quality in the vicinity. Commuting modes and routes are another area of action where good practices can reduce exposure. For example, when the same home-school route is taken by children walking and commuting by car, the pedestrians experience a higher dose of pollutants. However, by taking an alternative background route or avoiding proximity to traffic queues, pedestrians can lower their dose. In fact, studies show that pedestrians may be willing to change their route when presented with pollution information (Dirks et al., 2016; de Nazelle et al., 2017; Rafiepourgatabi et al., 2021; Wolfe et al., 2021), switching to alternative routes with less exposure (‘background routes’). More children walking to school also reduces motorised traffic and the resulting pollution from private vehicles. Placing schools away from high-volume roads and within a walkable distance from home can benefit children’s health via a lower exposure to air pollution (An et al., 2021), particularly when background routes are used. It can also benefit children’s health through increased physical activity (Chillón et al., 2015) — an important consideration given that in most situations the benefits of physical activity outweigh the risks of air pollution (Tainio et al., 2021). Ultimately however, economic, social, and other considerations may preclude altering the siting of schools or changing commuting modes. . The design of school and childcare facilities can contribute to minimising the exposure of children to air pollution while onsite. This may entail locating the most frequented rooms or areas as far away from road traffic as possible, shielding the playground behind buildings, walls or green infrastructure (i.e. using plants), and allowing natural ventilation patterns that promote pollutant dispersion (An et al., 2021). At the same time, care must be taken to avoid unfiltered ventilation when there are high pollution levels outdoors near the school. Green infrastructure can filter some air pollutants and alter the airflow — thus changing pollution concentrations in local microenvironments (Abhijith et al., 2017). The type, height and porosity of vegetation heavily influences this cleaning effect, but various solutions from ivy screens to hedge fences have proved effective locally (Tremper et al., 2015: Tremper and Green, 2018; Tomson et al., 2021; Redondo-Bermúdez et al., 2022). Beyond their air quality enhancing effect, green infrastructure in and around schools provides multiple social and environmental co-benefits, including cooling, sun protection, opportunities for physical activity, water storage, habitat conservation, etc. (Redondo-Bermúdez et al., 2022). Nevertheless, the level of greening around schools in urban areas in Europe is low. On average, just over 10% of the area within a 300m radius of educational facilities is green, and only 6% is covered by trees (EEA, 2023). Schools with the greenest surroundings tend to be in northern Europe (Figure 4). EEA (2023) . Children spend many hours indoors at school and kindergartens, so measures to reduce indoor air pollution in those spaces are crucial to reduce their overall exposure. Reducing toxic chemicals and mould is crucial for good indoor air quality in schools. Establishing regulations to improve indoor air quality and limit values for common air pollutants in places where sensitive populations gather is a crucial start (Vlaamse Regering, 2004; Lowther et al., 2021; UBA, 2023; Gouvernement de France, 2022). Clear sources of exposure to indoor air pollutants such as cleaning, painting, etc. should be organised to minimise children’s exposure, by scheduling them to take place after school hours, using low-emission cleaning products and materials, prioritising wet cleaning, fitting vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters, minimising the use of toxic chemicals, and using technologies like sorptive boards (surfaces engineered to trap certain pollutants) and CO monitoring in classrooms as an indicator of indoor air quality. In most school settings, outdoor air quality can be better than indoor air quality on several parameters, and ventilation is a prime tool to improve indoor air quality in classrooms and laboratories. It lowers CO levels and the risk of aerosol-transmitted diseases, removes moisture (and associated mould risks — see below), as well as odours and toxic chemicals from construction products, furniture and cleaning agents (Fisk, 2017; Aguilar et al., 2022). Ventilation of buildings can be improved by: (1) opening windows and doors to bring in ambient air, (2) using heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) devices, and ensuring exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens are working properly, and (3) communicating necessary background knowledge and instructions to students, parents, faculty and staff (Beregszaszi et al., 2013; European Commission et al., 2014; Baldauf et al., 2015; Jhun et al., 2017; Rivas et al., 2018; Thevenet et al., 2018; Brand et al., 2019; WHO Europe, 2022). Mould only grows when there is sufficient moisture, so detecting sources of moisture is the first step to controlling it. Leaking pipes, overflows, rain seeping through cracks or gaps in roofs, spills from blocked gutters, leaky window frames and rising damp are frequent causes of excess moisture, often leaving ‘tidemarks’ that should be interpreted as warning signs for mould. Another typical source of moisture is condensation, due to high humidity indoors and worsened by low temperatures and poor ventilation. Such sources of moisture should be eliminated, and any dampness removed via ventilation, dehumidifiers, etc. Thereafter, mould should be removed from affected areas. If the mould-affected area is large, or mould is present in the building structure and materials, removal should be done by qualified professionals, according to local and national standards. Finally, to stop mould and dampness from reoccurring, basic prevention measures should be undertaken including opening windows daily, using fans in bathrooms and kitchens, maintaining mechanical ventilation where installed, watching for and repairing leaks, and avoiding condensation on cold surfaces (WHO Europe, 2009; WHO, 2022). . The reduction of smoking in all its forms, especially in child-centric settings such as in and around schools and kindergartens, is of key importance to reduce children’s overall exposure to SHS, despite the fact that it can also occur at home, in vehicles and elsewhere. Exposure to SHS has been observed to be significantly reduced by implementing smoking bans in all public places (Liang et al., 2016; El Sharkawy et al., 2021; Laverty et al., 2021; Nogueira et al., 2022). A recent study in Germany (Burkhardt et al., 2023) measured an 82% decline in a biomarker of tobacco smoke in the urine of non-smokers from 1995 to 2019, and largely attributes this to smoking bans and regulations limiting SHS following European legislation. Bans can benefit children when implemented with a special emphasis and consistent enforcement in and around schools and kindergartens. Interventions establishing family rules for smoke free vehicles (e.g. when commuting to school), smoking counselling to parents or caregivers, strict enforcement of complete tobacco bans in and around schools, and awareness campaigns against SHS have all shown to work in reducing children’s exposure to SHS (Blaakman et al., 2013; Bunik et al., 2013; Sharifi et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2015, 2020; Hoehn et al., 2016; Mason et al., 2016; Caldwell et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2018; Turner et al., 2020). More evidence on SHS impacts on children and good practices to reduce exposure will be published in forthcoming EEA products. In addition to the good practices considered above, there is a wide range of local measures that can help protect the general population against air pollution. Well-informed residents are generally in a better position to demand action on air pollution and protect themselves from it. Two key EEA products can help citizens understand more about the air quality where they live. The European Environment Agency’s gives near-real time assessments of air quality for more than 3,500 air quality monitoring stations across Europe. The allows citizens to check how the air quality was in their city over the past 2 years and to compare it with air quality in other cities across Europe. While reducing European children’s and adolescents’ exposure to air pollution is crucial and urgent, the surest way to keep them safe in the long term is by making the air we all breathe cleaner. The EU bases its clean air policy on three main pillars: (1) the (EU, 2016); (2) source-specific legislation for key sources of air pollution (European Commission, 2022a); and (3) the Ambient Air Quality Directives (EU, 2004, 2008), which set air quality standards (EEA, 2021). In October 2022, the European Commission published a , including the following key measures (EEA, 2022a): The above measures are aligned with other legislative proposals, such as the revision of the and recent proposals on for road vehicles, which will support the achievement of stricter air quality standards. They are key to achieving one of the goals of the zero pollution action plan: reducing by 2030 the number of premature deaths caused by exposure to PM by at least 55% compared with 2005 levels (European Commission, 2022b). In the international context, the EU Member States work closely with other UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) member countries to control international air pollution under the UNECE . It should be noted that achieving the goals and air pollution levels set forth by current EU policies and regulation will still not mean that the air in Europe is safe for children and adolescents. For example, there is no evidence of a safe level or a threshold of exposure to PM below which no adverse health effects occur, and in the past research has tended to detect health impacts of air pollution at progressively lower levels. This notwithstanding, air in Europe which is cleaner overall will significantly contribute to making our children and adolescents healthier. Abhijith, K.

Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe and a major cause of premature death and disease. Latest estimates by the European Environment Agency (EEA) show that fine particulate matter (PM ) continues to cause the most substantial health impacts. Most Europeans live in areas, especially cities, where air pollution can reach high levels. Both short- and long-term exposure to air pollution can lead to a wide range of diseases, including stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trachea, bronchus and lung cancers, aggravated asthma and lower respiratory infections. The (WHO) provides evidence of links between exposure to air pollution and type 2 diabetes, obesity, systemic inflammation, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. The has classified air pollution, in particular PM , as a leading cause of cancer. A recent found that , complicating and exacerbating existing health conditions. Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable because their bodies, organs and immune systems are still developing. Air pollution and increases the risk of diseases later in life, yet children can do little to protect themselves or influence air quality policies. is the air pollutant driving the most significant health problems and premature mortality. In 2021, was exposed to concentrations of fine particulate matter above the health-based guideline level set by the World Health Organization. 238,000 premature deaths due to fine particulate matter above WHO-guideline level The , in 2020, approximately 238,000 premature deaths were attributable to PM in the 27 EU Member States. In 2020, premature deaths attributed to exposure to fine particulate matter fell by 45% in the EU-27, compared to 2005. Residential, commercial and institutional energy consumption was the principal source of particulate matter in 2020. The manufacturing and extractive industry was also a significant source, while agriculture was an equally important source of PM . Between 2005 and 2020, emissions of particulate matter, PM and PM , fell by 30% and 32%, respectively. In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) published following a systematic review of the latest scientific evidence demonstrating how air pollution damages human health. The European Union (EU) has also set in the . In the , the European Commission committed to further improving air quality and to aligning EU air quality standards more closely with the WHO recommendations. This commitment was echoed in the , which set a vision for 2050 to reduce air, water and soil pollution to levels no longer considered harmful to health and natural ecosystems. In addition, the zero pollution action plan introduced targets for 2030, two of which focus on air and aim to: Stricter air quality standards would also contribute to the objectives of . Air pollution is a known cause of cancer in Europe; in particular, lung cancer ( ). In terms of the past trend, from 2005 to 2020, premature deaths attributed to PM exposure in the EU-27 fell by 33% to reach 238,000. Should air quality continue to improve, and the number of premature deaths per year continue to fall at a comparable rate in the future, then the zero pollution target would be achieved by 2032, as shown in the figure below. In October 2022, the European Commission published . Key measures are listed below. The above measures are aligned with other legislative proposals, such as the revision of the and recent proposals on the for road vehicles, which will support the achievement of stricter air quality standards. Air pollution affects people in different ways. . In addition, the most deprived people in society often have poorer health and less access to high-quality medical care, increasing their vulnerability. There is strong evidence linking lower socio-economic status to increased exposure to air pollution. In large parts of Europe, and thus, face higher levels of exposure to air pollution. At the same time, exposure patterns vary across European cities. In some cities, wealthier people live in central, polluted areas, while in other European cities central areas are inhabited by poorer communities. In Europe, and tend to occur in Eastern and South-eastern Europe. This pattern is largely driven by the combustion of low-quality solid fuels (e.g. coal and wood) in low-efficiency ovens for domestic heating in those areas. The higher population exposure to PM in particular regions, translates into higher numbers of premature deaths attributed to air pollution. Besides premature death, air pollution also causes morbidity. People live with diseases related to exposure to air pollution; this is a burden in terms of personal suffering as well as significant costs on the healthcare sector. In 2019, exposure to PM led to 175,702 years lived with disability (YLDs) due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 30 European countries. At the same time, exposure to NO2 led to 175,070 YLDs due to diabetes mellitus (also known as Type 2 diabetes) in 31 European countries. That same year, 12,253 people across 23 European countries were admitted to the hospital with lower respiratory infections resulting from acute exposure to ozone. The interactive map viewer shows the spatial distribution of population-weighted concentrations of PM (as an indication of population exposure) across Europe and the associated mortality. The viewer also allows to display data against GDP per capita as a proxy for the average socio-economic characteristics of the population in each region. The data is presented for (between 150,000 and 800,000 inhabitants)."

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing In 1992, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), developed countries committed to adopting national policies and taking corresponding measures on the mitigation of climate change. To do this they agreed to limit their anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, and protect and enhance their greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs. Twenty-five years later, the 28 Member States of the EU have reduced their emissions by more than 22 % below 1990 levels and reported information concerning more than 1 500 national policies and measures that limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions or enhance the removal of CO from the atmosphere . A robust system to monitor national climate action and its effectiveness is essential to ensure commitments are put into action and lead to visible results, and to identify where additional efforts are needed. As such, reliable information on adopted, implemented or planned policies and measures is key for informing policy decisions. This is particularly so when long-term objectives to keep warming below 2 C, as agreed under the Paris Agreement, remain both ambitious and challenging. In the EU, a ‘monitoring mechanism’ has been in place for more than a decade to: Under this mechanism, every 2 years Member States report information on national policies and measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The EEA collects and checks the quality of this information, before making it available to the public and policy makers. An overview of the 1 513 policies or measures reported in 2017 has been made. This provides a detailed understanding of the main mitigation options followed by Member States in terms of policy objectives, instrument types, targeted sectors, etc., as well as the status of these policies and their links to EU policies , as follows: While qualitative information on policies and measures helps to understand better the nature of climate actions at national level, additional information on the effects of these actions is needed to help highlight successes and failures, and to provide a key knowledge base to inform policy decisions. This is why Member States must also report, where available, quantitative information on the greenhouse gas emission savings achieved by, or expected from, the reported policies and measures either individually or for groups of policies and measures. The quality of the information reported in 2017 improved in terms of its completeness, consistency, accuracy and transparency, compared with the reporting cycle in 2015. However, quantitative information onex postpolicy evaluations, costs and benefits, and indicators remains underreported. In 2017, only nine Member States (Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Poland) reported information on the emission reductions achieved, and for only 65 policies and measures (Figure 2). This does not allow for a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of existing national climate policies across the EU to be performed. It also highlights the further need for Member States to increase their efforts to assess the effects of their implemented policies more systematically. There can be technical explanations for the low level of quantitative information reported. For example, Member States do not use common evaluation approaches and methodologies, and may use different assumptions or find it difficult to separate the effects of individual policies from others. There may also be political reasons for this. Some policy makers may prefer to focus on new proposals and are often not very interested in communicating the actual effects of past actions. Comparing and summingex postemission savings therefore becomes a highly uncertain exercise. Detailed and transparent information on national policies and measures is essential to track climate action at national and EU levels. Additionally, policy evaluation plays a crucial role in policy processes, for example, by allowing policy makers to assess the contribution of specific policies to the achievement of climate mitigation objectives, and to understand success factors and obstacles to policy implementation. Further efforts on reporting and evaluation activities, even if incremental, are considered important to help improve the quality of the information reported under the EU monitoring mechanism and to support climate policy. On the Member States’ side, there have been recent quality improvements in the consistency, comparability, completeness and transparency of the information —particularly qualitative information – reported on national policies and measures. Efforts on quantitative aspects must, nevertheless, be further enhanced, notably onex postpolicy evaluation results, costs and benefits, and monitoring indicators. Member States could, for example, better exchange experiences and promote best practices on reporting and policy evaluation, reinforce their capacity to develop robust evaluation methods and demonstrate more clearly how evaluation results feed into the policy cycle. At the European level, the new is expected to facilitate the streamlining and reporting of climate and energy policies and measures, as well as their integration across policy domains. In addition, the EEA will continue its capacity building activities to develop and improve tools to make reporting more comparable across countries, to provide support and guidance to Member States and to promote exchanges of information, experience and knowledge among Member States.

On the Member States’ side, there have been recent quality improvements in the consistency, comparability, completeness and transparency of the information —particularly qualitative information – reported on national policies and measures. Efforts on quantitative aspects must, nevertheless, be further enhanced, notably onex postpolicy evaluation results, costs and benefits, and monitoring indicators. Member States could, for example, better exchange experiences and promote best practices on reporting and policy evaluation, reinforce their capacity to develop robust evaluation methods and demonstrate more clearly how evaluation results feed into the policy cycle. At the European level, the new is expected to facilitate the streamlining and reporting of climate and energy policies and measures, as well as their integration across policy domains. In addition, the EEA will continue its capacity building activities to develop and improve tools to make reporting more comparable across countries, to provide support and guidance to Member States and to promote exchanges of information, experience and knowledge among Member States. The EEA also intends to complement its with an inventory of evaluations of environment and climate policies, which will be made available online.

Between 2004 and 2022, emissions from large combustion plants in the EU decreased: sulphur dioxide (SO ) and dust by 92%, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 70%. Declines in emissions and improvements in environmental performance were largely driven by European policy, which sets legally binding emission limit values. Fossil fuel useage decreased by 35% as energy production shifts to climate-friendly sources, even if coal has returned as the most used fuel in large combustion plants in Europe. Stricter emission limit values and policies aimed at increasing the use of renewable or cleaner fuels are expected to drive further declines in combustion plant emissions in coming years. As of 2022, large combustion plants (LCPs) are responsible for almost 40% of the EU’s electricity production capacity. These largely depend on fossil fuels, resulting in the emission of pollutants to air, water and land, causing damaging our ecosystems. To mitigate the environmental impact, LCP emissions. Emissions from LCPs decreased significantly during 2004-2022: SO and dust by 92% and NO by 70% . This decreased highlighted ; 1) over the period 2007-2009, LCP operators had the double effect of needing to adapt their plants to new emission limit values from the and the financial crisis that started at the end of 2008, and 2) around 2015-2016 coincided with the moment operators had to comply with stricter limits set by the , which entered into full force. LCPs vary significantly in size, from 50MWt to even larger than 2,000MWt. Declines in emissions correspond to a in environmental performance across all LCP sizes, particularly among the very large ones, which, although including only 21% of LCPs, accounts for 70% of installed capacity. These reductions demonstrate the value of European policy in driving improvements in the environmental performance of LCPs, with LCP operators adopting pollution reduction measures, more efficient operating processes and end-of-pipe pollution abatement techniques . In 2022, 3,139 LCPs, were covered by the scope of the IED. European countries rely to different degrees on combustion plants to meet their . However, generally, the number of plants in a given country is proportional to its size and population. Czechia, Malta and Slovakia did not report 2022 data, and therefore the number of plants in Europe is estimated to be 4,047, taking into account the latest number from these four countries. The plays a key role in emission generation, with coal and liquid fuels substantially dirtier than other options. Shifting from fossil fuels to other energy carriers and sources is paramount to achieve climate mitigation goals. Changes to the fuel mix contributed to emission reductions over the period with other factors, including changes to a broader economy and society, international fuel prices and industry initiatives. The war in Ukraine impacted natural gas prices in 2022. Coal was the major fuel input, surpassing natural gas for the first time since 2019. Future data will show if this may be a slowdown of the phase-out from coal progression. Natural gas and coal combined, two fossil fuels, are still very significant in the overall mix covering almost 75% of the total fuel input (Figure 2) of the combustion sector. More are expected in the coming years as a result of stricter IED permits, and energy and climate change mitigation policies, driving the use of renewable or cleaner fuels aimed at achieving the EU’s ambition of becoming climate neutral by 2050 . Overall, LCP fuel consumption by 35% between 2004 and 2022 (Figure 2). Largely attributed to a decrease in the consumption of fossil fuels, particularly coal (down 46% since 2010) and liquid fuels (down 36% since 2010), this mostly occurred after 2010. It could reflect a shift in Europe’s energy system from fossil fuels to renewable sources, with natural gas still playing a bridging role in this transition. The war in Ukraine impact and rise of natural gas prices in 2022 are reflected on the overall consumption in 2022. Coal was the covering 37% of the consumption, followed by natural gas (36%) and consumption of liquid fuel increased by 14% from 2021 levels. This pause in the coal phase-out should be monitored in the near future as it may have a negative impact on achieving the goals set by the . All EU countries reduced coal use over the 2004-2022 period, with five (Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and Poland) contributing for around 70% of the reduction in coal consumption (Figure 2) in 2022. However, coal still accounts for more than 50% of the fuel input in large combustion plant in four countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland and Slovenia). Another interesting phenomenon is the consistent increase of biomass as a fuel input (86% since 2010). While this has its origin in climate mitigation goals, it can result in increases of air pollution, particularly particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds . This indicator tracks trends for the so-called Large Combustion Plants' (LCPs) emissions of SO , NO and dust, as well as the evolution of the energy mix used in these plants since 2004. LCPs comprise industrial combustion plants with a total rated thermal input equal to or greater than 50MW. The geographical coverage comprises the 27 EU Member States (EU-27) (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden). The temporal coverage is 2004-2022. Data for the period 2004-2015 were reported under Directive 2001/80/EC on large combustion plants, while for 2016 onwards they were reported under Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions. The requirements are not identical, and it is expected for data from 2016 onwards to have a slightly broader scope in terms of plants included. Queries are applied to the Industrial Emissions Database to extract and aggregate emissions reported individually for each LCP in Europe to produce Figure 1. In a similar manner, queries extract and aggregate fuel use data to produce Figure 2. Fig. 1: Emissions are indexed with reference to 2004 levels. The exact formula is: emissions of pollutant x for the current year/emissions for pollutant x in 2004) × 100. Fig. 2: Total fuel consumptions per type are summed and provided in the graph. As the data were not reported in the same way before and after 2016, the category 'coal' is the result of the sum of all solid fuels reported. Slovakia did not report any data from 2018, Malta did not report any data from 2019 and Czechia did not report data for 2022: in this cases the most recent data were used to gap-fill the trend. No methodology references available. No rationale has been identified for this indicator. Anthropogenic emissions of SO , NO and dust all contribute to air quality problems in Europe. Excess deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds can lead to disturbances in the functioning and structure of ecosystems by, for example, causing the acidification of soils and waters as well as, in the case of nitrogen, the eutrophication of nutrient-poor ecosystems such as grasslands. LCPs use large amounts of fuels, mostly fossil fuels, to produce useful forms of energy. These plants inevitably generate a number of residues, waste products and emissions to all environmental media (air, water and soil). Emissions from LCPs constitute a significant proportion of total anthropogenic emissions and are considered one of the main environmental pressures from LCPs. In that context, policy has regulated these plants for decades now. Between 2004 and 2015, two pieces of EU law were in place: the LCP Directive and the IPPC Directive. This EU legislation imposed specific limit values on emissions of NO , SO and dust from plants with a thermal rated input equal to or greater than 50MW. Since 1 January 2016, this legislation has been replaced by . The aim of EU policy on LCPs is to reduce emissions to air, water and land, including measures related to waste, to achieve a high level of protection of the environment as a whole. The focus with regard to LCPs is to reduce emissions of acidifying pollutants, particles and ozone precursors while also covering other environmental concerns (e.g. mercury emissions). No targets have been specified. No related policy documents have been specified. This indicator covers the EU-27 countries. However, there are no data for Croatia for 2004-2009. The data for Croatia have not been gap filled, and in the years of reporting Croatia contributed less than 1% of emissions and fuel consumption to the EU-27 total. This lack of data is thus considered a minor distortion of the overall trend. As indicated, reporting requirements were not identical before and after 2016, which is also considered a minor distortion of the trend. Although reporting requirements began in 2004, it is possible that the data for the first reported period (2004-2006) contain some gaps. No uncertainty has been specified.

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing This briefing builds on the EEA’s recent , which assesses progress towards the EU’s climate and energy targets, and a . The findings are based and and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a that Member States reported to the EEA in March 2019 under . The work also relies on the results of two detailed assessments of trends in the Effort Sharing sectors carried out by the European Topic Centre (ETC) for the EEA in and . The EU’s Effort Sharing legislation aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the sectors that are not included in the (EU ETS). This represents a wide range of sources, such as petrol and diesel use for road transport, energy use for heating and cooling in households and commercial buildings, animal digestion and fertiliser use in agriculture, waste treatment and small industries. Altogether, these emissions make up about 58 % of total greenhouse gas emissions at EU level. The Effort Sharing legislation does not apply to emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), which are covered by the and from 2021 by the . The legislation sets national annual greenhouse gas emission targets for the periods 2013-2020 ( ) and 2021-2030 ( ). These annual targets are different for each country: The national emission targets for 2020 range from a 20 % reduction by 2020 (from 2005 levels) for the richest to a 20 % increase for the least wealthy one, Bulgaria. Taken together, the national 2020 targets represent a 10 % reduction in EU Effort Sharing emissions compared with 2005, which is in line with the EU target of a 20 % reduction in all greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (including those in the EU ETS), compared with 1990. For 2030, the national emission targets range from 0 % (no change from 2005 levels) to 40 % below 2005 levels (applicable to Effort Sharing emissions only). These targets correspond to an EU reduction of 30 % from 2005 levels by 2030, as a contribution towards the current reduction target of 40 % below 1990 levels for all greenhouse gas emissions in the EU Member States and the United Kingdom. After a 14 % decline between 2005 and 2014, followed by three consecutive annual increases from 2015 to 2017, Effort-Sharing emissions in the EU Member States and the United Kingdom decreased by 0.9 % in 2018 to a level 10.8 % (309 Mt CO e) below that of 2005. This was below the corresponding target level for the period 2013-2020 (Figure 1). Between 2005 and 2018, the largest reduction in Effort Sharing emissions took place in the heating and cooling of buildings (155 Mt CO e) (Figure 2; Figure 3). Emissions were also reduced in the waste management sector (66 Mt CO e) and in small industries (61 Mt CO e). The transport and agriculture sectors only contributed to small reductions in the Effort Sharing sectors (25 Mt CO e and 2 Mt CO e, respectively) during this period. Today — more than halfway through the 2005-2030 period — the total reduction achieved so far in the Effort Sharing sectors represents only one third of the reduction needed by 2030 to achieve the target of a 30 % reduction compared with 2005 in these sectors. From 2018 onwards, the annual rate of emission reductions at EU level needs to nearly double to achieve the cuts foreseen under the Effort Sharing Regulation. If Member States and the United Kingdom were to implement the additional policies and measures that are already planned, Effort Sharing emissions could decrease to a level 27 % below that of 2005 by 2030, according to projections reported by Member States and the United Kingdom to the EEA under the Mechanism Regulation in March 2019. Most of these reductions are expected in the transport, buildings and industry sectors, while agriculture remains the sector where countries do not foresee any significant change in emissions over the next decade. The aggregated reduction in the Effort Sharing sectors would still fall short of the expected contribution from Effort Sharing sectors towards the EU’s 2030 target. More action is therefore needed at a national level to decarbonise their economies further and faster. The next section focuses on each of the main Effort Sharing sectors, highlighting key emission trends and the national climate policies that aim to reduce these emissions. Transport — without aviation, which is covered by the EU ETS — is responsible for more than one third of emissions from the Effort Sharing sectors. It is the largest sector covered by Effort Sharing legislation. Transport has only played a minor role in curbing Effort Sharing emissions so far, with a reduction of just 25 Mt CO e between 2005 and 2018 (Figure 3). The sector’s emission trend shows the key role played by this sector in driving total Effort Sharing emissions upwards since 2014, as a result of the growing demand for passenger and freight road transport (Figure 2). The net reductions achieved so far can be attributed to the improved energy efficiency of vehicles and the introduction of low carbon fuels. Countries expect a significant change in transport emission trends, with large reductions expected, in particular in road transport. However, these projected reductions mostly rely on additional measures that are still to be adopted and fully implemented (Figure 3). Most of the 111 planned measures on transport target Of these 111 measures, 34 are associated with quantified expected emission savings by 2030, as reported by eight Member States (Czechia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania and Spain). Estonia is the Member State reporting the largest expected reduction of its national transport emissions from transport policies by 2030. Estonia provided quantified reductions of transport policies such as the improvement of the efficiency of the transport system, the implementation of a passenger car registration system and annual road usage fees for passenger cars. Other examples of quantified policies ad measures include energy-efficiency improvements of cars and vans and promoting the use of biofuels in the transport sector in Finland, as well as the implementation of incentives for the use of combined freight transport in Lithuania. Heating and cooling activities of residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions in the Effort Sharing sectors, the second biggest source after transport. Fluctuations in weather conditions from one year to another (i.e. warmer or colder winters) are an important cause of annual variations in this sector’s emissions. However, emissions over the period 2005-2018 show a clearly decreasing trend (Figure 2Figure 3). This can be linked to several policy-driven factors, in particular the increasing energy efficiency of buildings and the switch to less carbon intensive fuels, including renewable energy sources for heating and cooling. Countries expect emission cuts from heating and cooling in the building sector to continue as a result of the further implementation of existing measures and the introduction of additional measures. In 2019, 18 Member States reported information to the EEA regarding 73 planned policies and measures targeting improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings . These encompass the With 17 % of total Effort Sharing emissions at EU level, agriculture is the third largest source of emissions in the Effort Sharing sectors. With emission trends in this sector nearly constant between 2005 and 2018, this sector has hardly contributed to reductions in the Effort Sharing sectors (Figure 2). Projections indicate that countries plan rather low emission reductions in this sector (Figure 3). In 2019, 12 Member States reported information on 55 planned policies or measures targeting greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture . These measures most commonly aim at Policies and measures reported are often related to the implementation of European policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy, the Nitrates Directive and the Renewable Energy Directive. Five Member States (Finland, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, and Spain), reported quantified reduction effects in 2030 for 14 of their planned measures. Lithuania reported measures expected to deliver significant reductions in its agriculture emissions (more than 10 %), including the provision of compensatory support to farms for emission-reducing activities, the development of organic farming and the amendment of mandatory requirements for the use of mineral nitrogen fertilisers. Spain reported quantified information on a measure supporting the improvement of animal waste management systems there. This sector, referred to as ‘small industry and other’ in this briefing, covers emissions from energy industries, manufacturing and production industries, fugitive emissions and industrial processes that are not covered by the EU ETS. Fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions as also included. The sector saw emissions substantially decrease between 2005 and 2018 (-61 Mt CO e) (Figure 2). These reductions resulted primarily from improvements in energy efficiency. Planned policies and measures addressing these emissions typically include energy efficiency measures for industrial installations and the promotion of renewable energy. Many of these measures also affect emissions covered by the EU ETS. While the waste management sector is by far the smallest sector in terms of its contribution to Effort Sharing emissions, it delivered the second largest reduction in Effort Sharing emissions between 2005 and 2018 (-66 Mt CO e) (Figure 3) and the largest relative reduction (-33 %). These reductions were mainly driven by measures aiming to improve waste management, to limit the quantity of landfilled waste and improve landfill management, as well as better treatment technologies and enhanced recycling. Countries expect limited additional emission reductions in this sector. Only 7 Member States reported information on 15 planned policies and measures, which include Germany, Lithuania and Spain provided quantified expected reduction effects for 2030 as a result of 5 policies or measures. Effects included the minimisation of the amount of landfilled waste in Lithuania and a set of measures in Spain (prevention of waste generation, household composting, separate collection of organic matter for biological treatment and separate collection of other fractions such as paper, cooking oil and textiles for recycling, and the promotion of the use of renewable gases), which would reduce these countries’ waste emissions by 35 % and 19 %, respectively. Evidently, reported information on emission savings expected from national policies and measures in the Effort Sharing sectors remains insufficient. Further monitoring and evaluation of the effects of policy at national level is clearly needed to identify the most effective measures to achieve climate neutrality in the EU. , please go to or scan the QR code.

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing In 2019, the EU-wide share of renewable energy was less than half a percentage point below the binding 20% target for 2020 (EEA, 2020a, 2020d, Eurostat 2021). At 34% of all electricity generation, renewable electricity has almost doubled since 2005, and coal no longer supplies most of the EU’s electricity. However, still altogether (38% of all generation in 2019). With combustion-based installations dominating the power mix, the EU electricity sector gives rise to almost a quarter of all EU greenhouse gas emissions. It also remains an important source of acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone formation (EEA, 2020b). Offering the potential for rapid expansion, renewable electricity plays a leading role in Europe’s decarbonisation strategy (EC, 2020a, 2020b, 2020d). Except for biomass and the biodegradable fraction of waste, renewable power sources have negligible emissions during generation. But, even so, increasing the renewable power supply is not impact free, because constructing renewable power generation components and plants is both material and energy intensive. That leads to specific upstream and downstream emissions and impacts, while new infrastructure can affect vulnerable habitats. Going beyond climate mitigation, a detailed life cycle analysis was undertaken to calculate global changes in overall environmental impacts associated with the trends in the EU power mix between 2005 and 2018, especially given the shift towards increasing shares of renewable electricity generation. The aim was to estimate how key environmental impacts had changed by 2018, thanks to the increase of renewable sources in the electricity supply across the EU, relative to the benchmark year 2005. Officially reported annual generation data for 16 main renewable and conventional power technologies in each Member State and at EU level were used to provide insights on six essential environmental impact categories: By looking at both upstream and downstream parts of the value chain, life cycle analysis can also highlight interactions between domestic measures and global pressures because of the growing complexity of international trade. Unsurprisingly, the results show that, in 2018, annual life cycle continued to be combustion, followed by emissions from natural gas and oil burning (Figure 1). Since combustion-related emissions affect many categories , Compared with 2005, the increase in renewable electricity generation by 2018 had significantly decreased life cycle greenhouse gas emissions at the EU level. In fact, for most of the impact categories investigated, the switch from fossil fuel to renewable electricity sources resulted in clear improvements in 2018, compared with 2005: at the EU level, the life cycle impact potentials of eutrophication, particulate matter formation and acidification were all lower in 2018 than in 2005. For and for , however, the life cycle impact intensities are more evenly spread across renewable and non-renewable sources, with the exception of clear outliers such as ecotoxic impact intensities associated with electricity generation from municipal solid waste and land occupation intensities associated with electricity produced from solid biomass. Consequently, the analysis indicates that substituting fossil fuels with a growing share of renewable electricity across the EU has increased impact potentials for freshwater ecotoxicity and land occupation by 2018, compared with 2005. These findings are in line with the International Resource Panel’s landmark study on the benefits, risks and trade-offs of low-carbon technologies for electricity production (UNEP, 2016). That assessment also found that renewable power requires larger amounts of metals and other minerals per unit of electricity generated, while generally having consistently lower environmental impacts than power generated from fossil fuels in nearly all impact categories investigated. Whereas for freshwater ecotoxicity the potential increase is related to increases in solar photovoltaic (PV) power and in the incineration of biodegradable municipal waste (and to lesser extents to geothermal power), for land occupation the deterioration is associated with increases in biomass use and solar PV power . Small, but noticeable, impacts are also observed for particulate matter formation, related to increased biomass generation. These overall trade-offs are partially compensated for by a simultaneous increase in the contribution of other renewable electricity sources. Changes in gross electricity generation are accounted for in the figure (gross electricity generation in 2018 is 1% higher than in 2005). GHG, greenhouse gas. ETC/CME, 2020 These changes came about because of shifts from coal to natural gas and renewables-based generation in most Member States since 2005. Most of the avoided impacts were driven by an increase in electricity generation from onshore wind power and solar PV sources, followed by electricity generation from solid and gaseous biomass fuels. A considerable part of the avoided impacts can be attributed to the in favour of renewable and natural gas generation. The life cycle improvements related to the EU’s power supply are especially clear when these estimates are compared with a counterfactual scenario that freezes the share of renewable electricity generation at the 2005 level. In the counterfactual scenario, the growth in renewable power is replaced every year by a mix of conventional sources that changes with the relative annual share of each fossil fuel in the generation mix. The results of this stylised comparison show that the increased use of solar PV and wind power have contributed significantly to reducing life cycle pressures across the impact indicators investigated. One trade-off is that the growth in renewable electricity appears to have increased the potential ecotoxicity- and land occupation-related impacts of Europe’s power supply, as shown in Figure 2. ETC/CME, 2020 Fully implementing national climate and energy plans for 2030 would allow the EU to overachieve its current climate and renewable energy targets for 2030 (EC, 2020c; EEA, 2020d). Such developments, however, would still be insufficient for the EU to meet a higher target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, of 55% by 2030, or to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 (EC, 2020d). To meet these higher pledges, to almost 70% of all EU generation by 2030 and to over 80% by 2050 (EC, 2020a; EEA, 2020c), allowing sectors that are harder to decarbonise to reduce their emissions through electrification. Investments in the renewable electricity supply need to be ramped up to meet those targets and speed up the energy transition. Furthermore, higher carbon prices under the EU Emission Trading Scheme would make renewable power sources more competitive (see also EEA, 2020c). By substituting more polluting fossil fuels, expanding renewable electricity generation across the EU provides multiple opportunities to improve human health and the environment while mitigating climate change. However, and potentially other targeted measures will need to accompany these trends to avoid environmental problem shifting, including in areas not addressed by this study. Other critical tools for policymakers will be improvements in cross-sectoral energy and resource efficiency and giving special attention to the planning, design, selection and siting of projects depending on the habitats, species and ecosystems potentially affected. Several processes and emissions associated with renewable electricity generation lead to high life cycle impacts. However, opportunities to decrease relative and total impact intensities do exist, despite considerable differences in the life cycle impacts of the national electricity supply sectors. Solar PV has a relatively high impact intensity for ecotoxicity because of the emissions of metal, related to mining and smelting operations, and chlorine from the purification of solar-grade silicon. Reducing the demand for raw materials, e.g. by prioritising better , can lower process emissions, bringing down the corresponding life cycle emissions for solar PV power generation. Solar PV power’s greenhouse gas impact intensity is also among the highest of all renewable sources across the value chain. Emissions accumulate from a collection of processes, each contributing a little. As the construction of solar PV modules requires both heat and electricity and takes place globally, the cumulative effect leads to relatively high total emissions of greenhouse gases. Increasing the reliance on would help to bring down the emission intensity of solar PV components. For biodegradable municipal solid waste, almost all ecotoxicity impact potentials arise from the incineration process itself, offering potential opportunities to mitigate impacts by adopting more . Similarly, for particulate matter formation linked to biomass fuels, process emission contributions are highest during burning, indicating a potential to install further emission control measures. In addition, focusing efforts on , such as third-generation biofuels, could considerably reduce the overall high land use intensity associated with the current fuel supply chains. to reduce the need for standby generation during peak consumption, measures to improve across end use sectors, and more sustainable, proposed under the circular economy action plan could further reduce some of the potential negative impacts associated with the transition to renewable power supplies, while simultaneously increasing its cost-effectiveness. For non-combustible power sources, measures also include to reduce the emission intensity linked to upstream and downstream processes. Finally, efforts to improve the are essential to reduce adverse trade-offs associated with the energy transition. This briefing considers the changes in the EU power sector since 2005 across six key impact categories. Other dimensions that are important to ensure a sustainable transition across the sector were not included in this assessment. Ranging from impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (following, for example, changes in land use and in river ecology and morphology) to resource depletion, understanding and addressing these aspects will prove essential to avoid and reduce future impacts, as renewable electricity is set to grow. Life cycle analysis is a quantitative approach for assessing products in terms of their environmental, human health and resource consumption impacts. The method enables a generic assessment of environmental impacts that occur globally across supply chains. The work is based on constant impact factors, leading to impact potentials, which are then compared to identify environmental problem shifting and potential hot spots in value chains. However, the approach should not be confused with assessments based on more detailed estimates of emissions and impacts, e.g. atmospheric dispersion of air pollutant emissions and subsequent impacts on human health. The analysis includes activities related to materials and fuel extraction, transport and refining, the construction of (plant) components and infrastructure, plant operation and end-of-life plant decommissioning. Information on national Data on emissions of [ ] Combustion processes are a main source of key air pollutant emissions, especially sulphur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ) and carbon monoxide, of particulate matter (PM , PM ) and heavy metals (such as mercury, lead and cadmium) and of persistent organic pollutants (in particular hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyl). Most of these pollutants are linked to coal combustion. [ ] [ ] Mainly copper and, to a lesser extent, silver, nickel and zinc.

The is to mobilize at least one trillion euros of investments over the decade. It will create the right environment — or ‘enabling framework’ — to facilitate and stimulate the needed for the transition to a climate-neutral, green, and inclusive economy. The EU is a main contributor to the global and has set up a a net of well-structured collaboration on sustainable finance, such as: The EU has come up with a that will be key for mobilizing, scaling up and channeling private investment in more sustainable technologies and businesses and for financing economic growth in a sustainable manner in the long term. The Commission has put in place different building blocks for a sustainable finance system: The first European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA) identifies 36 climate risks that pose a threat to Europe’s energy and food security, ecosystems, infrastructure, water resources, financial stability, and people’s health. Many climate impacts can affect the economy and the financial system, from where they can cascade further to other policy areas that may be deprived of financial resources. To accelerate the green transition, Europe needs a solid socio-economic and fiscal policy framework to ensure the European Green Deal is smoothly implemented in the upcoming EU institutional cycle. This requires some clear political decisions and good policymaking, namely within fiscal and industrial policies. New green industrial policies can help overcome limitations in public finance for the green transition. The EEA has contributed to the design of EU sustainable finance policy through in and input to several expert groups assisting the European Commission in its work on the and its components such as the EU Taxonomy. The EEA is a permanent member of the , formed under the EU Taxonomy Regulation advising the Commission on the development of the EU Taxonomy and on the implementation of the Sustainable Finance Framework.

The reiterates the EU’s long-term 2050 vision of living well, within planetary boundaries. These ambitions are to be achieved through ‘sustainability transitions’ that require radical changes to our core systems of production and consumption — energy, mobility, food and the built environment — as well as to our established ways of living and working. The commitment of the European Green Deal to ‘leave no one behind’ and the commitment of the to build a fairer more inclusive society, provide overarching guiding principles for just sustainability transitions that together with concrete measures and initiatives, are a clear recognition of how the social and environmental problems facing Europe are interwoven. These instruments intend to safeguard social welfare and ensure a fair and just transition to climate-neutral societies, acknowledging that inequalities exist between regions in Europe and that certain social groups will be disproportionately affected. They include the (including the ), which was launched in 2020, the subsequent and the . Recent research from the United Nations and the EEA highlights the , who often have a lower share of the responsibility for creating environmental problems (EEA, 2022, IPCC, 2022). These groups will also bear significant future costs from adaptation to the impacts of climate change, pollution and environmental degradation. While the EU sets the direction for just and equitable transitions, an understanding is still lacking in terms of how justice considerations and environmental sustainability goals can be jointly delivered through effective policy interventions (Avelino et al., 2023). For instance, the recently agreed broadens the debate around justice to include nature and the environment and extends the focus from protecting ecosystems to restoring degraded or destroyed ecosystems. There is a need to document experiences and develop recommendations on how to design, implement and evaluate policies to achieve just sustainability transitions for humans and other species in nature. This briefing is a first step towards addressing this need by describing some of the key elements and relationships. Sustainability transitions are processes of long-term structural change towards more sustainable societal systems. They include profound changes in ways of doing, thinking and organising, as well as in underlying institutions and values (Loorbach et al., 2017). This entails decisions about the direction of change, in a context where there are many legitimate perspectives on desirable futures and how to reach them. The effective governance of transitions requires participatory processes that enable a diverse set of stakeholders to identify shared visions and goals, and credible pathways to reach them. Prerequisites include democratising access to environmental information, increasing public participation in decision-making and providing access to justice in environmental matters as laid out in the . Large-scale, systemic change involves trade-offs. It creates winners and losers and may trigger unintended outcomes that disproportionately affect vulnerable territories and social groups. This can exacerbate existing inequalities and generate resistance to change (Agyeman, 2013; Swilling, 2020). The concepts of inequality, justice and equity are themselves complex as Figure 1 below illustrates. Achieving sustainability will have significant distributional consequences, making it critical to pay careful attention to equity considerations (IPCC, 2022). Policies should monitor and anticipate potential losses and the unequal distribution of costs and benefits arising from systemic changes with the aim of sharing these costs across society (EEA, 2022). Sustainability transitions can be considered as ‘just’ when these processes of transformative change ‘improve the quality of life of current and future generations, both human and non-human, within ecological boundaries while eliminating injustices that are triggered or exacerbated by unsustainability and its underlying causes’ (Avelino et al., 2023). EEA, 2024. Adapted from Tony Ruth from Maeda (2019) with . When considering how to capture the concepts of justice in sustainability transition policies, it is useful to distinguish between the key dimensions of justice as described below. relates to how the costs and benefits of human activity, as well as policies to manage these activities, are allocated across our society and to other species in the natural environment, as well as to the values and principles according to which goods and services are allocated. It concerns not only which entities pay costs and which receive benefits, but also their perceptions of what constitutes a cost or a benefit (Langemeyer and Connolly, 2020; Biermann and Kalfagianni, 2020; Wijsman and Berbés-Blázquez, 2022). Sustainability transitions must also tackle existing injustices linked to environmental degradation and climate change. Air pollution poses the greatest environmental health risk in Europe but the impacts of air pollution are unequally distributed across our society. Fine particulate matter (PM ) causes more premature deaths in Europe than any other ambient air pollutant. Monitoring PM levels is therefore considered useful for exploring income-related inequalities in the distribution of the health impacts of air pollution. . In an environmentally equal Europe, poverty and pollution would not be correlated. However, monitoring data shows that despite improvements in air quality in both the richest and poorest regions of the EU 2007 and 2020, inequalities remain, with levels of PM concentrations consistently higher by around one third in the poorest regions. This shows a lack of progress in reducing disparities in exposure to air pollution across Europe (EEA, 2023). focuses on fairness in the institutions, procedures and practices of decision-making, and the judicial processes and the extent to which these are inclusive. It looks at who participates in and benefits from decision-making processes and why, and how to define and deliver inclusive participation. This entails the identification and inclusion of those entities typically not represented in decision-making and judicial processes, such as homeless people, undocumented people, socially excluded groups, children, future generations and other species in nature, such as animals and plants (Langemeyer and Connolly, 2020; Wijsman and Berbés-Blázquez, 2022). The EU and its 27 Member States are all parties to the – the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters. The convention aims to ensure environmental democracy by laying down a set of basic procedural rights for the public, imposing obligations on public authorities to make these rights effective, increasing transparency and making governments more accountable to people. The Aarhus Convention is translated into EU law through several legislative acts. The aims to ensure that environmental information is systematically made available by the authorities to the public either actively or upon request. The 2003/35/EC provides for public participation when formulating certain plans and programmes relating to the environment. Provisions for public participation in environmental decision-making are also found in a number of environmental directives, such as the and the . implies the recognition of underlying systemic injustices and representation of dignity, values and identities of humans and other species. When referencing humans, this dimension refers both to individuals and social groups and entails recognising and respecting how different values, preferences and needs are rooted in diverse histories, identities and cultural backgrounds. For other species, this implies recognising the intrinsic and inherent value of nature regardless of its utility to humans (Wijsman and Berbés-Blázquez, 2022). A recent report published in 2020 documents cases of , whereby Roma people were living in marginal and polluted areas, without access to basic services such as water and sanitation. These poor environmental conditions seriously impact their health and welfare (EEB, 2020). The non-governmental organisations, the European Environmental Bureau and the European Roma Grassroots Organisations Network, have highlighted the environmental injustice and social inequality the Roma communities face and are campaigning for recognitional justice for these marginalized communities (EEB, 2024). The need for adaptation to climate change is increasingly urgent. Adaptation strategies and plans are being progressively developed and implemented across Europe. Ensuring that no one is left behind requires a focus on equity and the meaningful engagement of vulnerable groups at all stages of adaptation planning, implementation and monitoring. EU policies and instruments such as the and the emphasis on higher levels of citizen engagement. A recent EEA briefing, looks at how climate change affects vulnerable groups and how these impacts can be prevented or reduced through equitable adaptation actions. It also presents examples of how vulnerable groups are already involved in developing equity-oriented policies and measures in some European countries. For example, in Finland, children, youth, the elderly and the Sami indigenous people were consulted on climate change planning. In Slovenia, municipalities engage with those particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts as they are required to consult with representative organisations on a wide range of activities from civil protection in natural disasters to elderly care (EEA, 2023). Our understanding of justice in sustainability transitions is strengthened by considering the three dimensions of justice through the interplay between them and five of justice that together make the picture more complete. The extent to which individuals connect to different dimensions of justice depends upon their circumstances. For example, an individual’s age, sexuality, gender, ethnicity, nationality, socio-economic and legal status may influence their perception of justice as well as their access to it. Without acknowledging such , policymakers may fail to understand the diversity of society and therefore be at risk of addressing the needs of certain groups while neglecting others (Crenshaw, 1989; Gonzalez, 2020). In addition, an individual or group’s to mobilise resources, participate in decision-making processes and take advantage of the opportunities that policies may offer will vary (Bierman and Kalfagianni, 2020; Nussbaum, 2011). In evidence-based policymaking, an important aspect is how knowledge, including indigenous knowledge, is recognised and treated as relevant, valid, and legitimate in problem-framing and decision-making. entails the exclusion of individuals or groups from the process of creating and assessing knowledge (Fricker, 2007; Wijsman and Feagan, 2019; Ghosh et al, 2021). The spatial and temporal reach of policies affect their effectiveness in delivering justice. concerns the geographic area addressed by legislation and the level at which it is implemented, be it local, regional, national or international (Langemeyer and Connolly, 2020; Soja, 2010; Stevis and Felli, 2020). concerns how policies address issues of justice over time, for example, the needs of future generations for a safe and healthy environment, and the responsibility of current generations to restore past environmental degradation (Langemeyer and Connolly, 2020; Gonzalez, 2020). The resulting conceptual framework for just sustainability transitions is categorised according to different dimensions of justice and concepts for justice as presented in Figure 2. Taranto, a city in southern Italy, has been faced with social, economic and environmental challenges due to a dependency on the iron and steel industry. A grassroots initiative called , aiming to transition the local economy from steel manufacturing to tourism and agroecology, includes efforts to restore brownfield sites and contaminated industrial land, and to find new sustainable ways to reuse industrial buildings in line with circular economy principles. The local community has been involved in developing and steering the plan, which prioritises both distributional and recognitional justice. The plan aims to ensure that people impacted negatively by the changes are given a voice, directly addressing concerns about job losses. The creation of new jobs, notably in agroecology, not only supports the community but also contributes to easing environmental pressures. EEA, 2024. There are different types of justice each with a focus on particular themes or domains. Examples include epistemic justice, climate justice, energy justice, food justice, urban justice and restorative justice. The three dimensions of justice mentioned earlier (distribution, procedure, and recognition) and the five concepts of justice (intersectionality, capabilities, epistemologies, spatiality and temporality) are critical across all those different thematic and domain-specific types of justice. Restorative justice recognises how past inequities continue to shape present conditions and aims to address these injustices, deliver resolution, and enable healing (Forsyth et al., 2022; McCauley and Heffron, 2018). It is particularly relevant when remediating degraded environments and addressing the impacts of climate change. The Nature Restoration Law, for example, provisionally agreed in November 2023, extends the focus from protecting ecosystems to restoring degraded or destroyed ecosystems. (see box on the Nature Restoration Law). In the context of sustainability transitions, restorative justice centres on processes to compensate for past harm to humans and other species and ecosystems. Such processes involve multiple stakeholders with diverse perspectives and focus on identifiable harm and victims, and the individuals, groups and institutions that take responsibility and can be held accountable for harm. Restorative justice is also important in the design of new policies, which must avoid causing intergenerational impacts. Outcomes can take the form of financial compensation for losses, or the restoration of natural areas degraded through human activity. This may include operations to restore land and aquatic ecosystems, while ensuring that remediation efforts do not impact negatively on vulnerable communities (Forsyth et al., 2022). An example of steps towards restorative justice in a European country is the response to the detection of large-scale soil and groundwater pollution around a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) production plant in Antwerp, Belgium operated by 3M (Vito, 2022). Following several months of negotiation, 3M agreed to pay EUR 571 million in response to the pollution near its factory including: EUR 250 million for priority remedial actions, EUR 100 million to the Flemish Government for PFAS related actions and EUR 100 million to support the Oosterweel project to complete the Antwerp ring road where the pollution was first revealed. More recently and in response to follow-up efforts to test the blood of nearby residents for contamination with PFAS, 3M has been ordered by a court in Antwerp to pay provisional damages of EUR 2,000 in compensation to a local family whose blood was contaminated by its activities. The European Green Deal launched in December 2019 sets out an ambitious roadmap to transform the European Union into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, published in May 2020, couples these aims with a zero-pollution ambition and cross-cutting environmental objectives to achieve climate-neutrality, recover biodiversity, and restore degraded ecosystems. , provisionally agreed on in November 2023, and the European Climate Law adopted the year prior, will be important steps towards delivering the key commitments of the European Green Deal and are central to achieving overarching EU climate and biodiversity objectives. The Nature Restoration Law is the first piece of legislation explicitly focused on the restoration of nature in EU Member States. It will support the recovery of degraded ecosystems by improving their structure and functions to enhance biodiversity and its resilience. It sets a binding target at EU level and requires Member States to implement effective restoration measures on at least 20% of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030. By 2050, measures should be in place for all ecosystems in need of restoration. This target builds on the international commitment undertaken by the EU and its countries as a party to the global . The main instruments of the Nature Restoration Law are the national restoration plans, where Member States will identify restoration measures required to meet the binding targets set in the law and specify the total area to be restored, as well as a timeline covering the period up to 2050. The preparation, review, and implementation of national restoration plans incorporate procedural justice ensuring access to environmental information and involving key stakeholders in public decision-making processes. In line with the Aarhus Convention, the plans should document information on public participation and how the needs of local communities and the general public have been considered. It also contains elements of recognitional justice and aims to restore nature in all ecosystems, including forests, agricultural land, marine, freshwater, and urban ecosystems. Restoration is framed as living and producing together with nature by improving biodiversity across all land and sea, including areas where economic activity takes place, such as managed forests, agricultural land, and cities. In terms of distributional justice, Member States should explore opportunities to promote the deployment of private and public support schemes that benefit stakeholders implementing restoration measures. The definitions above explain the different dimensions of justice and how an individual’s or group’s circumstances can affect their access to justice. What does this mean for efforts to deliver justice in the context of sustainability transitions? Efforts to deliver justice tend to focus on certain social groups while neglecting other social groups and, indeed, other species in nature. For example, without adequate compensatory measures and educational support for reskilling, members of communities dependent on coal mining for their livelihoods may not consider efforts to transition to green energy to be just. It is necessary to consider the needs of a broad range of social groups in the context of achieving just sustainability transitions. Justice is a complex and multi-dimensional concept and therefore processes to deliver justice within the context of sustainability transitions will inevitably be subject to blind spots and unpredictability. For instance, when considering justice in our food systems globally, we may overlook injustices at the local level and vice versa. We may also prioritise justice for humans at the cost of other species. Policymakers face the challenge of capturing multiple dimensions, while acknowledging likely blind spots. Sustainability transitions are characterised by tensions and conflicting trade-offs. For instance, there is a trade-off between the urgent need to address the unequal distribution of the impacts of climate change on the one hand and the time required for inclusive decision-making on the other hand. When prioritising certain dimensions of justice over others, it is important to be transparent about the rationale and how this affects processes and outcomes. Every intervention and every decision not to intervene runs the risk of having unintended consequences that generate injustices. For instance, greening urban areas and implementing nature-based solutions may lead to green gentrification, rising property prices and the displacement of marginalised communities. Policymakers should therefore seek to anticipate negative consequences and, where possible, prevent them or compensate the affected groups. Delivering justice requires a continuous commitment and a process to assess progress. While policymakers cannot always anticipate the negative impacts of policies, building in processes to evaluate polices can enable them to identify injustices in terms of distribution, procedure and recognition, and adjust policies to redress such impacts. For example, taxes on energy consumption are often regressive, disproportionately burden lower-income households and can in some cases exacerbate existing inequalities or create new ones. This briefing presents a framework for understanding justice in the context of sustainability transitions. Policy interventions aiming to foster transitions towards sustainable futures operate across complex societal systems at different scales. As such outcomes can be unpredictable. Such broad sustainability transition policies have the intention of creating better outcomes but are unlikely to completely avoid unjust impacts. In the next phase of our work on justice in sustainability transitions, the EEA will use this conceptual framework to develop recommendations to support the design, implementation, and evaluation of just sustainability transition policies that ‘leave no one behind’.

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing Conducting the UK’s first VNR has yielded many lessons and insights. The UK recognises that the 17 SDGs represent a framework for addressing the cross-cutting challenges facing the UK and the world today. They yield interlinkages which the government, business and civil society can collaborate on to develop holistic long-term solutions that benefit society as a whole and contribute to several SDGs simultaneously (HM Government, 2019). The UK has a strong story to tell domestically on many of the SDGs, including progress made on climate and the environment. At the same time, it acknowledges that there are areas that require boosting the country’s efforts further to address climate and environmental issues (HM Government, 2019). The country is proud of its commitment to leave the environment in a better state than it inherited. Sustainable agriculture is at the heart of this commitment. On SDG 2, steps are being taken across the UK to improve the sustainability of farming and food production. For SDG 6, the UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan sets out a range of measures to achieve clean and plentiful water. There has been important progress in recent years. For example, England now has consistently high levels of clean bathing waters, serious pollution incidents are steadily declining, and rivers that were biologically dead are being revived (HM Government, 2019). The UK adopts a holistic approach to all 17 SDGs. The country’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus mainly on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. On SDG 7, the UK is working on making energy affordable for all and to sustain improvements in energy efficiency. Its ambition is to meet its climate change commitments at the lowest possible cost to British taxpayers, consumers and businesses, while being at the forefront of clean technologies and maximising the social and economic benefits of the global shift to clean growth (HM Government, 2019). On SDG 11, the UK is focusing on building sustainable cities and infrastructure of the future to face the challenges of natural disasters, changing climates, and shifting populations (HM Government, 2019). On SDG 12, the ‘Greening Government Commitments’ identified a set of actions for the UK government to reduce their impacts on the environment. Citizens and business are also encouraged to be responsible for their environmental impact. The UK is working to minimise waste, promote resource efficiency, and move towards a circular economy. The introduction of the carrier-bag charge and landfill tax are considered to have shown significant impacts on such behavioural shifts (HM Government, 2019). The government is working with its fishing industry and marine scientists to ensure sustainable fish stocks. The UK is a forerunner of global efforts to tackle marine plastic and has introduced a strict ban on microbeads. Further action will focus on the impacts of climate change on the ocean (SDG 14) (HM Government, 2019). The condition of the country’s land ecosystems (SDG 15) continues to be affected by land use, pollution, invasive alien species, and climate change. Although the decline in the number and distribution of certain species have slowed, action must continue. Therefore, the UK is focusing its action on better protection of ecosystems, improved management of protected sites, incentives for farming and woodland management, and funding for peatland restoration (HM Government, 2019). In preparations for the VNR, the country conducted wide stakeholder engagement across the UK through case studies, events or by providing feedback electronically. The VNR outlined both good practices and key areas where further action is required (HM Government, 2019). Several charities have come together to establish the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD), a multi-stakeholder network aiming to inspire and support public, private and voluntary organisations. The work of the UKSSD has been complemented by the Bond SDGs Group, a civil society coalition of over 150 organisations advocating the full implementation of the SDGs (UK, 2017a). Project Everyone (a UK-based non-profit organisation that aims to ‘mak[e]ing the SDGs famous’] has also pursued efforts to promote the SDGs at the international level (UK, 2017a). In the UK, the Secretary of State for the Department for International Development (DFID) has overall responsibility for overseeing implementation of the SDGs, working closely with the Cabinet Office to ensure that they are incorporated throughout government structures (UK, 2017a). The role of the Cabinet Office is to ensure that the goals are integrated into departments’ Single Departmental Plans (SDPs). The underlying aims of the SDGs are reflected in the UK government’s work programme and, as such, are embedded in the SDPs. An interdepartmental group on the SDGs across the UK government on the Goals, co-chaired by officials in the DFID and Cabinet Office, also provides governance for the overall process in the UK (UK, 2017a). The UK submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. The UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) is committed to sourcing data that gives the clearest picture of the UK’s contribution to the SDGs. As of June 2019, the ONS reports UK data on 180 (74 %) indicators of the total 244.The ONS has created a portal for gathering and disseminating the UK’s national SDG indicators and the relevant data (ONS, 2017a). This reporting platform has a dual purpose: to make national data on the SDGs publicly available and to provide a collection point for the relevant agencies who need UK data to prepare the clustered global figure reported to the UN (ONS, 2017b).

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing In 2016, the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a plan of action for marine conservation and sustainable fisheries, together with an allocation of over EUR 180 million. The new initiatives are a further step in the Ministry's implementation of its 10-point Plan of Action for Marine Conservation and Sustainable Fisheries. Based on the need to implement the 2030 Agenda, especially SDG 14 (life below water), Germany launched a federal research and development funding programme, MAREN, where the ‘N’ stands for sustainability (Nachhaltigkeit) (Federal Republic of Germany, 2016). Germany's action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 3, 12, 13, 14 and 15. In Germany, stakeholders and citizens have played an important role in planning and progressing towards SDGs with an environmental dimension. Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) emphasises that a broad societal consensus on the SDGs is a precondition for achieving them. The varied and numerous activities of the ‘Fridays for Future’ initiatives in Germany have increased the pressure on the government to be more active on environmental protection issues. The example of the Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment shows that stakeholders play an important role in Germany’s efforts to find sustainable answers to structural change questions. In June 2018, the Commission was convened by the federal government to develop a social consensus around structural changes to energy and climate policy in Germany. The Commission comprised members from industry and the economy, science, environmental associations and unions as well as representatives of the lignite mining regions. In January 2019, the Commission presented its final report which includes recommendations for measures to promote the social and structural development of lignite mining regions. The federal government has stated that it intends to implement the Commission's results. The country experienced several barriers to action on SDGs with an environmental dimension, including the challenge of ensuring policy coherence. This requires the coherent, coordinated deployment of all policy instruments to advance the SDGs. Furthermore, cooperation between the federal government and theLänderis challenging. The GermanLänderplay a crucial role in SDG action as they have legislative and administrative powers in vital areas of sustainable development (Federal Republic of Germany, 2016). Even though regularly collected representative data on environmental awareness in Germany shows a high level of awareness of issues relevant to sustainable development, only around 10 % of people in the country were aware of the SDGs in 2018. Because the population’s support is vital for making environmental SDGs a success, the German federal government initiated a campaign to make them better known. Germany submitted a VNR to the UN in 2016. The most important enabling factor for implementing the SDGs in Germany is the institutional architecture for the G National Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) and the fact that the primary responsibility for the GSDS lies with the federal chancellery. The GSDS outlines how the guiding principle of sustainability is to be implemented in the federal government’s current and future work. The Committee of State Secretaries on Sustainable Development steers progress on the GSDS and oversees its revision (Thomson, 2017). The work and interaction of the State Secretaries’ Committee on Sustainable Development (StA NHK), the Parliamentary Advisory Council on Sustainable Development (PBnE) and the Sustainable Development Council (RNE) have proven to be effective and will be continued. The aim of the StA NHK is to focus cooperation between the ministries’ various policy areas on common sustainable development through implementation of the GSDS and the SDGs. The PBnE plays an important role at the interface between society and politics. The RNE has a dual function: it is a stakeholder in the social dialogue on sustainability and an advisor to the federal government. In 2018, the federal chancellery initiated a process to revise the GSDS and align it with the 2030 Agenda. The process involved all ministries, the parliament, the federal state, authorities at the regional and local level, civil society, the private sector and academia (Federal Republic of Germany, 2016). The updated GSDS constitutes a framework for tracking Germany’s progress towards the 2030 Agenda. Tools include biannual monitoring reports by the Federal Statistical Office as well as four-year progress reports on the GSDS (Thomson, 2017). In June 2018, all members of the public, associations and organisations were once again — as was the case when the 2016 German Sustainable Development Strategy was drafted — invited to contribute their own ideas to the process of compiling the updated GSDS. Currently, updating the GSDS also takes place in dialogue with the population. Around 1 500 citizens took part in dialogue conferences nationwide from October 2019 to February 2020. The GSDS highlights the need to strengthen the involvement of societal stakeholders. In recent years, for example, the Sustainability Forum and the Science Platform Sustainability 2030 were established. The Forum is held annually and helps the federal government to communicate with key stakeholders about the status and future of implementation of the Sustainable Development Strategy and the 2030 Agenda. The platform is intended as an interface between academia, society and policy to support implementation of the GSDS and the SDGs with scientific expertise (Federal Republic of Germany, 2016).

Briefing Under the partnership, this prioritisation will involve nine SDGs (SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15), reflecting the importance of environmental protection and resilience as per the 2030 Agenda (UN, 2016). Environmental sustainability is one of four priority areas for North Macedonia. It involves SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. North Macedonia embarked on mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into its National Sustainable Development Plan in December 2015, with the aim of developing an SDG Plan 2016-2030, based on an assessment of needs and potential, as well as setting targets relevant to the national context (Spasenovska et al., 2017). The plan is under the overall responsibility of the vice-prime minister’s cabinet and aims to mainstream the 2030 Agenda at the national level. The government will also integrate SDG implementation into a four‐year government programme for the period of 2016‐2020 and harmonise it with the relevant sector strategies, plans and programmes (Wiederkehr et al., 2016). A multi‐stakeholder process will be launched (including decision-makers and stakeholders at the national, regional and local level, as well as non-governmental stakeholders from academia, the private sector, donor agencies, NGOs, etc.), with the support of the UN Development Programme. The objective is to prioritise the SDGs, localise the targets, select local target indicators, develop a budgetary framework and review the relevant national sectoral strategies and the level of adjustment needed to align them with the SDG agenda (Wiederkehr et al., 2016). To lay the foundations for implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the government has undertaken a joint initiative with the UN to integrate the SDGs into the national planning process. This will start with the prioritisation of SDGs and the localisation of targets, as well as the selection of local indicators (Spasenovska et al., 2017). All resident UN agencies, together with the UNECE, will support North Macedonia to adapt the SDGs to local conditions and to establish a system for tracking progress. Similarly, all UN agencies will support its alignment with EU standards and legislation, including through peer-to-peer exchanges with EU Member States (UN, 2016).

As regards SDGs with an environmental dimension, Turkey`s SDG actions focus primarily on preserving genetic resources and biodiversity (SDGs 2, 15); sustainable and climate-adapted agricultural production methods and technologies (SDG 2); ensuring sustainable water management which strikes a balance between nature conservation and resource development (SDG 6); energy efficiency in transport, buildings and industries (SDG 7); encouraging ‘zero waste’ at the industrial scale (SDGs 9, 12); promoting bioplastic and eco-labelling (SDG 9); raising awareness of consumers and producers on sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12); ensuring GHG emission control through new technologies (SDGs 9, 13); climate adaptation (SDG 13); preventing and reducing marine litter (SDG 14); maximizing the use of aquaculture resources in marine and inland waters, improving the protection of aquaculture stocks and aquaculture development (SDG 14); holistic planning and management of the terrestrial ecosystem, promoting high value-added forest ecosystems, developing holistic policies on gene, species, habitat, ecosystems, and scaling up the conservation and sustainable use of the terrestrial ecosystem (SDG 15) (Government of Turkey, 2019). Turkey was among the 22 countries that submitted their first VNR to the HLPF in 2016. The VNR process commenced with the highest-level political ownership on the Turkish president’s call to all government entities (Government of Turkey, 2016). Turkey`s second VNR, in 2019, focuses on progress towards the SDGs made between 2010-2018. The Presidency of Strategy and Budget, which is also responsible for preparing NDPs, is the national focal point for SDGs and coordinated the 2019 VNR preparations. The VNR process accelerated the steps to address policies from this perspective (Government of Turkey, 2019). Turkey established a National Sustainable Development Commission to lead the concerted action by all relevant institutions to achieve the SDGs. The country also focuses on engagement with non-governmental stakeholders and aims to make SDG action a shared responsibility among all relevant stakeholders (UN DESA, 2016). The Turkish Industry and Business Association, Independent Industrialists’ and Businessmen’s Association, Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation, Business Council for Sustainable Development Turkey and the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey were selected as the coordinating institutions to represent the private sector. Civil society and all the relevant UN agencies are coordinated by the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office to the Republic of Turkey, while the Union of Municipalities of Turkey was appointed as the coordinating institution for local administrations. As a result, a total of 2 962 representatives from government entities, 312 NGOs, 2 000 companies and 50 municipalities were consulted directly on VNR preparations (UN DESA, 2019). Turkey submitted two VNRs to the UN in 2016 and 2019. Through the VNR process, the Turkish government developed an online ‘National SDG Best Practices Database’ which will be active throughout the period covering the 2030 Agenda. In the first phase, 400 practices were collected from public and private sectors, academia, NGOs and municipalities, and several of the best examples were included in the VNR (Government of Turkey, 2019). After the adoption of Agenda 2030, Turkey assigned the responsibility of tracking 218 indicators to relevant institutions. In 2019, the country published its SDG Indicators Set, comprising 83 indicators. While the ratio of indicators produced is higher for SDGs 3, 7, 9, further work is needed for indicators on SDGs 1, 2, 12, 13 and 14 indicators (Government of Turkey, 2019). The Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) follows up on the international process for determining the global SDG indicators. After the identification of the global SDG indicators list, in 2019, TURKSTAT issued an ‘SDG Indicators Newsletter, 2010-2017’. Turkey plans to prepare its National SDG Review Reports periodically, in line with the Agenda of the UN HLPF. TURKSTAT will take on the central role of tracking progress on Agenda 2030. The country is also working on promoting voluntary stocktaking processes for the private sector (UN DESA, 2016).

In December 2015, the government of Montenegro adopted the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD) until 2030. The NSSD considered national circumstances and commitments while defining the strategic goals and measures on SDG action and aligning sectoral policies to the SDGs. The Strategy structured the strategic objectives into five priority themes, including preservation of natural capital (SDGs 14, 15); and the introduction of a green economy, governance, and finance for sustainable development (SDGs 7, 8, 9, 12) (Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism of Montenegro, 2016). By participating in international dialogue on the SDGs and Agenda 2030, Montenegro expressed its full commitment to the priority issues of sustainable development, such as: the introduction of a green economy, strengthening the efficiency of use natural resources (SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7); climate change (SDG 13); conservation of sensitive ecosystems and coastal areas (SDGs 14, 15); and sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12). Priority is also given to creating conditions to achieve progress on key determinants of sustainable development enshrined in the relevant EU policies, primarily the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism of Montenegro, 2016). Montenegro submitted a VNR to the UN in 2016. In addition to the SDG indicators developed by the UN, Montenegro’s NSSD 2030 includes selected national indicators, indicators of relevant international organisations and cumulative indicators from the programme activities of the UN Development Programme in Montenegro (Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism of Montenegro, 2016 The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to or scan the QR code.

France`s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15. France launched SDG action by designating an Interministerial Representative for Sustainable Development and General Commissioner for Sustainable Development, who led the preparation of the country’s first report on the SDGs. Subsequently, a national action plan was developed, underpinned by the following elements: a shared vision; government measures and public policy guidelines for sustainable development; assistance to economic players; and citizens’ ownership of the SDGs (Republic of France, 2016). France engaged stakeholders through an online public consultation on its national action plan to ensure citizen involvement. The country also set up a committee of international experts to act as a knowledge source for developing the plan (Republic of France, 2016). France submitted a VNR to the UN in 2016. The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) is responsible for the production and coordination of data with the statistical departments of the various French ministries. To produce national SDG indicators, the INSEE conducted a feasibility study involving all relevant ministries. The resulting list of 109 national SDG indicators was published in March 2017. The National Reform Programme, which reflects the goals of the 2030 Agenda ( ) is consistent with these indicators (INSEE, 2017). The process involves a government assessment report to be submitted to the parliament each October (Republic of France, 2016).

To meet future challenges for drinking water and groundwater quality, over 30 parties have signed a declaration of intent to jointly improve water quality further (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). On SDG 7, the Netherlands has one of the lowest rates of renewable energy production in Europe. Thus, this SDG remains a challenge for the country. Measures and policies are being developed to find innovative ways to reduce industry’s energy use (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). As regards SDG 9, the Nether­lands is promoting sustainable innovation and investment, particularly green innovations, such as a bio-based, the circular economy and electric transport. For SDG 11, the Kingdom focuses on 12 priorities, including air quality, the circular economy, climate adaptation, energy transition, sustainable land use and nature-based solutions. On SDG 12, tackling food waste and hazardous waste are identified as priority areas. The Netherlands gives high importance to reducing GHG emissions and achieving climate change adaptation (SDG 13) (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). For SDG 14, the Kingdom is focusing on reducing marine pollution, toxic substances, marine litter and microplastics to acceptable levels as well as safeguarding marine biodiversity and achieving sustainable fisheries. On SDG 15, conservation, resto­ration and the sustainable management of nature still pose challenges. Thus, the government introduced additional measures, in particular to protect meadow birds and promote environmentally friendly agriculture (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). Although the Kingdom of the Nether­lands’ starting position is promising, it has also identified certain gaps in terms of SDG achievement. The most challenging areas of action point to the circular economy (SDG 12), climate action (SDG 13), low-carbon energy transition (SDG 7), sustainable food and agriculture (SDGs 2, 15), and sustainable fisheries (SDG 14) (PBI Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, 2016). The Netherlands consumes large quantities of fossil fuels and has high per-capita GHG emissions. The share of renewable energy in the total energy supply is low compared to other European countries. The quality of groundwater, surface water and coastal waters, fisheries, as well as natural habitats and biodiversity are under considerable pressure across the country. It promotes sustainable economic growth (SDG 8) by paying extra attention to climate change (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). In the Netherlands, responsibility for performing SDG action have been assigned to all the ministries concerned, coordinated by the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation which is the coordinating cabinet member for SDG action. An Interministerial Network of SDG Focal Points formulates and stimulates government action by proposing SDG-related strategies to the Council of Ministers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented its Action Plan in 2016, advising on national coordination on a permanent basis. In 2016, the government reported progress on the Action Plan to the parliament (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). The Netherlands has integrated tracking its SDG progress into the regular policy cycles. Every year, the government submits a report to the parliament, outlining national SDG progress. In May 2019, the third report (in Dutch) on SDG progress was presented to parliament via the regular budget and reporting cycle. Five umbrella organizations representing the private sector, knowledge institutions, NGOs, local governments, and youth each contributed a chapter to the reports. Since 2019, the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights has also contributed to the report on an annual basis. The Netherlands submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017 and plans to present a second one in 2022-2023. The Netherlands believes that national and local governments, the private sector (including the financial sector), civil society organizations, knowledge institutions and young people are all key partners in implementing the SDGs (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). Thus, the country works closely with stakeholders to promote SDG implementation in partnership. For example, the SDG Charter is a growing multi-stakeholder platform with over 500 Dutch companies, NGOs, knowledge institutions and philanthropists who have declared their intention to contribute to the SDGs in partnership. The SDG Community is an online community of active stakeholders across sectors where partners can create profiles and showcase their work on the SDGs. In September 2017, the Kingdom launched the first SDG Action Day, during which the stakeholders discussed the SDGs with Members of Parliament and opened the first Dutch SDG House in Amsterdam, creating a meeting point for SDG partners. This event also initiated the ‘Adopt an SDG campaign’ by the NGO-coalition Building Change in which 25 Members of Parliament declared their commitment to one or more SDGs. Since 2019, the national assessment framework for new laws and policies has become ‘SDG-proof’, requiring law- and policymakers to assess the effects of their legislation on SDG progress. These adjustments will create more transparency on the contributions of new laws and policies to achieving the SDGs.

For this purpose, the Maltese government has been working on developing a national Vision 2050 which aims to provide guidelines towards long-term sustainable development in Malta, whilst integrating the 2030 Agenda into sustainable development policies across all levels of government. As part of its efforts to identify the steps needed for SDG action, the country launched the process of interministerial consultations (UNECE, 2016). The aim is to have a long-term objective that integrates the 2030 Agenda while, at the same time, defining sustainable development guidelines based on maximising the three pillars of sustainable development across all levels of government. Malta’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. From a purely environmental perspective, this vision contemplates the development of a policy that is aimed at the following critical targets: fostering the sustainability of farming activities by adapting to the local geo-climatic conditions and organic farming (SDG 2); better managing the supply of improved water quality and ensuring an adequate supply of good-quality drinking water, treating wastewater and harvesting rainwater (SDG 6); reducing the country’s carbon footprint and GHG emissions through energy efficiency and replacing heavy fuel oil with natural gas and gas oil, and renewable sources (SDG 7); improving resource efficiency in production (SDG 8); promoting greener enterprises (SDG 9); promoting energy efficiency and green spaces in cities (SDG 11); sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources (SDG 12); climate action (SDG 13); marine litter, eutrophication, exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches, minimising and addressing the impacts of ocean acidification, maintaining fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels and marine protected areas (SDG 14); and supporting afforestation, as well as safeguarding ecosystems and biodiversity (SDG 15) (Government of Malta, 2018). Since 2013, the Ministry for the Environment, Sustainable Development and Climate Change (MESDC) has been mandated by the prime minister as the lead agency for sustainable development matters, as set out in Malta`s Sustainable Development Act. The Act provides for the establishment of three structures to promote the sustainable development agenda: 1) the competent authority, which is responsible for a number of functions, as defined by the Act (currently the MESDC); 2) the Guardian of Future Generations, which is entrusted with promoting sustainable development principles and safeguarding the interests of future generations; and 3) the Sustainable Development Network (UN DESA, 2018). Malta submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. The NSDS will be accompanied by an action plan which will outline the implementation timeline and structure of the sustainable development actions (Government of Malta, 2018). It will be the overarching umbrella for existing and future policy and strategy drafted by the Maltese government. Civil society, the private sector, academia and the public will be invited to provide feedback on the SDG actions at regular intervals (UNECE, 2016). SDG-related data collection and monitoring is managed jointly by the MESDC and the National Statistics Office (NSO) (Government of Malta, 2018).

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing The SDS is complemented by an action plan that lays out concrete actions and initiatives in nine target areas, including responsible consumption and production (SDG 12); urban development, mobility and infrastructure (SDGs 9, 11); energy and climate change (SDGs 7 and 13); as well as the protection of natural resources (SDGs 2, 6, 15) (Swiss Confederation, 2016). Switzerland’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15. The federal government’s other environmental goals include the conservation status of the populations of national priority species by 2020 and improved conditions in endangered habitats (SDG 15), the limited impact of waste and closing materials’ cycles (SDG 12) (Swiss Confederation, 2018). Switzerland’s VNRs recognise barriers and conflicts related to mainstreaming the economic, social and environmental dimensions of innovation, including ‘conflicts of use’ in environmental protection, human settlement, energy, and transport, as well as domestic policy spillovers. The 2018 VNR identified areas where additional efforts are needed to achieve the SDGs. For example,, Switzerland’s use of natural resources from within the country is declining but its use of natural resources from abroad is ‘increasing in an unsustainable way’, hindering the country’s progress on SDG 12 (Swiss Confederation, 2018). In Switzerland, the SDG action is pursued at the federal, regional, and communal level. Its 16 regional governments (cantons) and 234 municipalities are strongly involved in sustainable development policies and many have adopted their own strategies. High-level supervision on SDG action is provided by the Federal Council of Switzerland. The federal government intends to intensify dialogue with the cantons and communes and support them on the 2030 Agenda, for example, through platforms for exchange and networks (Swiss Confederation, 2018). An Interdepartmental National 2030 Agenda Working Group was also created to coordinate national efforts and ensure that the SDGs are integrated within Switzerland’s institutions. It is co-led by the Federal Office for Spatial Development and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (Swiss Confederation, 2018). Switzerland works closely with civil society and the private sector to advance its SDG action. All levels of government as well as the private sector, non-governmental organizations and the scientific community are engaged in the process at the federal, cantonal and communal level, according to relevant competencies, established division of tasks and the principle of subsidiarity. Many cantons and communities have defined sustainability and coordination mechanisms for sustainable development and engage in dialogue with the federal government on SDG action. An advisory group of non-state actors has identified priority challenges for the country and provides a platform for dialogue with the federal government on issues related to achieving the SDGs (Swiss Confederation, 2018). Switzerland submitted two VNRs to the UN in 2016 and in 2018. To track its progress towards the SDGs, Switzerland uses its sustainable development monitoring and reporting system (MONET) which has been in place since 2003. In May 2016, MONET’s reference framework was realigned with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. The system was expanded to enable the continuous monitoring of progress towards the goals and is currently tracking 85 SDG indicators. Federal offices are required to address sustainable development in their periodic reports on items of business or areas covered by their sectoral policies. Switzerland plans to publish a report on progress towards achieving the SDGs every four years, as from 2018. It will also draft a report in partnership with the cantons, communes and non-governmental actors which will be released to the public at the same time (Swiss Confederation, 2017b).

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing In general, Finland sees the need to transform today’s linear economies into circular economies, where virgin materials are used sparingly, and recycling and reuse are the norm (SDG 12). A circular economy is viewed as a solution to job creation and environmental protection. Therefore, the country aims to transform its energy systems and develop ways to account for the environmental costs of economic activities (SDG 7) (Pokka, 2017). Finland held the chairmanship of the Arctic Council during 2017-2019. As the Arctic is warming twice as rapidly as the globe, it has called for urgent measures to achieve the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement and SDG 13 (Pokka, 2017). Finland’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus on SDGs 2, 7, 12, 13, 14 and 15. According to the SDSN SDG Index and Dashboard 2019 and the analysis conducted in the context of Finland’s sustainable development policy evaluation (PATH2030), the greatest long-term challenges in Finland arise from high levels of consumption of materials (SDG 12) and energy (SDG 7). Key themes that should be addressed by sustainability-oriented policies include the energy system (SDG 7), forest use (SDG 15), aquatic ecosystems (SDG 14) and food systems (SDG 2) (Berg et al., 2019; Finnish Environment Institute, 2020). Thus, the Finnish government has focused on two themes for SDG action; a ‘carbon-neutral and resource-wise Finland’ and a ‘non-discriminating, equal and competent Finland’, which cover all SDGs in an integrated manner (Prime Minister`s Office, 2020). The Finnish parliament first discussed the 2030 Agenda and the parliament’s role in December 2016 and since then has received the government’s yearly progress reports and has made recommendations to the government. The Committee for the Future is responsible for the 2030 Agenda in the Finnish parliament. (Prime Minister’s Office Finland, 2016). Finland submitted two VNRs to the UN in 2016 and 2020. The latest strategy for sustainable development ‘Finland We Want, 2050’ was adopted in December 2013 and updated in April 2016 in line with the 2030 Agenda. It has eight aspirational objectives. In addition to the strategy, in February 2017, the government adopted its Implementation Plan for the 2030 Agenda. Sustainable development has also been integrated into the state budget since 2018. Special focus has been on budgetary allocations to measures supporting carbon neutrality and resource wisdom (Prime Minister`s Office Finland, 2020). The Finnish national network for the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda was launched in October 2016. The network is composed of members from various ministries, research institutions and other stakeholder organisations. It has defined a national follow-up and review mechanisms for Finland, including around 50 national sustainable development indicators. An interactive and participatory online follow-up mechanism enables multi-stakeholder discussions on the progress made, and on gaps and prospects for future development. This mechanism is an opportunity to bring sustainable-development-related data, trends and challenges into wider public debate and knowledge (Prime Minister`s Office Finland, 2016). Finland has a long tradition of engaging the civil society and other stakeholders in its sustainable development work. The key mechanism on SDG action has been the multi-stakeholder National Commission for Sustainable Development. A multidisciplinary Expert Panel for Sustainable Development, comprising 10 eminent scientists and professors, and the Agenda 2030 Youth Group of 20 young sustainable development ambassadors have challenged and supported the work of the government and the National Commission. The national Citizens’ Panel for Sustainable Development, composed of 500 ordinary citizens from all walks of life, was first established in 2018 and renewed in 2019 through a public call. Each panellist was tasked with assessing the current state and recent development of sustainable development in Finland by using an online assessment tool. The assessment was made individually for each of Finland’s 50 national sustainable development indicators, based on indicator data, specific expert analyses, and citizens’ comments on indicators and analysis (Prime Minister`s Office Finland, 2020). Commitment205.fi — an online tool — is one of the most important instruments in Finland for boosting participation in and concrete action on sustainable development. There are currently over 2 000 operational measurable commitments from all spheres of society. A sustainable lifestyle service for citizens enables Finns to pursue a more sustainable everyday life. With the renewed service, users can first calculate their personal carbon footprint and then draw up a personal plan to reduce it by choosing suitable actions from a selection of recommended smart choices. Every individual plan contributes to the national emissions reduction target (Prime Minister`s Office Finland, 2016). Finland provides regular national reports on its progress towards achieving the SDGs. An external independent evaluation was published in March 2019 to assess the national implementation of the 2030 Agenda, both in domestic and international policies (Berg et al., 2019). Finland recognises one of the top barriers to progress on SDGs with an environmental dimension as the gap between current action and the need for radical transformation. It acknowledges that although some measures have been taken, they have not been ambitious enough. For example, an analysis of the Finnish state budget has shown that those budgetary items which are counterproductive to carbon neutrality and resource wisdom still account for almost double the amount that is conducive to SDG action. The country acknowledges that the use of indicators to track progress is insufficient because many spillover effects are still unknown as they are difficult to measure based on indicators. Another barrier for the country has been the conflict of interest between different stakeholders, especially between economic and environmental objectives, and insufficiency in the systematic use of indicators and research data in decision-making and societal learning. The enabling factors included long-term national work on environmental and nature protection through legislation, economic instruments, voluntary measures, and environmental institutions and governance. Sustainable development is a widely shared and mainstreamed aim in Finland and nature is a highly valued ecosystem service, including the public’s right of access to it. International environmental agreements and EU legislation also provide a solid and binding framework for national policies and measures. For further progress, Finland aims to create more knowledge on the externalities of its consumption and production to better understand and measure the environmental impact (footprint and handprint) in other countries. It also recognises that the work towards environmental goals must be coupled with work to combat inequality to achieve a just transformation. To this end, the country acknowledges the need for integrated impact assessment tools for national legislation, strategies and action plans.

Briefing Under the inclusive and sustainable development priority, Estonia set out to rethink production and consumption processes in an eco-innovative manner (SDG 12). The country prioritises circular use as well as smart and innovative solutions that sustain the environment (SDGs 7, 9). Readily available information about chemicals in products is considered necessary to phase out hazardous substances and reduce the negative impact on health and the environment, as well as the planned recycling of the material (SDGs 3, 7) (Lõhmus, 2017). Estonia’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 9, 12, 13 and 15. In the first half of 2018, Estonia held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Ahead of this, it set out priorities based on four themes, two of which are related to environment: a ‘safe and secure environment’ and ‘inclusive and sustainable development’ (Republic of Estonia, 2016). To ensure coordination among the relevant line ministries, the country established an Interministerial Sustainable Development Working Group which works on an ad hoc basis and is composed of representatives from each ministry and Statistics Estonia. Estonia tracks progress on SDG actions through a set of sustainable development indicators which are regularly reviewed. According to Statistics Estonia, of the 231 global SDG indicators, 32 are currently measurable by Estonia´s national sustainable development indicators. Gathering information on the remaining indicators requires further effort and the development of a set of national SDG indicators (Republic of Estonia, 2016). Estonia submitted two VNRs to the UN in 2016 and 2020. A gap analysis, a mapping exercise and indicator-based analyses indicate that Estonia is successful in several SDGs, including SDG 7, by achieving a high proportion of renewable energy in overall energy consumption, and SDG 15, thanks to rich biodiversity protection. The analyses also show that Estonia`s main challenges lie in developing an energy- and resource-efficient economy and reducing carbon dioxide emissions per capita, which require continued efforts toward SDG action in those areas (UN DESA, 2020).

Briefing The government adopted Sweden’s Action Plan for the 2030 Agenda with the intention of reinforcing efforts to achieve the SDGs and indicating how government agencies and other actors in society can contribute (Kingdom of Sweden, 2017). The Action Plan includes key political measures for the years 2018-2020. It also highlights six cross-sectoral focus areas, including a socially beneficial, circular, and bio-based economy; corporate social responsibility; a sustainable and healthy food chain; and knowledge and innovation (Government Offices of Sweden, 2018). Sweden’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus on SDGs 2, 3, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Sweden’s environmental objectives have been decided by the Riksdag and constitute the national objectives that contribute to attaining the environmental dimension of the SDGs. At the same time, Agenda 2030 can also revitalise and provide new conditions to catalyse the achievement of the country’s environmental objectives (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, 2020). The Swedish parliament has approved several of the government’s communications and bills that have a bearing on the 2030 Agenda. All ministries produced action plans which provided the basis for the 2016 Government Communication on the Sustainable Development Goals (Kingdom of Sweden, 2017a). In 2015, the government established the Scientific Council for Sustainable Development tasked with serving as a platform for dialogue between the government and the scientific community and helping to provide a sustainable development policy with a scientific basis (Kingdom of Sweden, 2017a). In addition, Sweden’s budget proposal for 2018 indicated the contribution of fiscal policy to sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda is mentioned in the financial plan and in most of the 27 spending areas, showing an almost two-fold increase in areas compared to the 2017 budget (Kingdom of Sweden, 2017b). Sweden submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. In 2017, the Swedish VNR identified several challenges, such as establishing sustainable energy (SDG 7); and climate resilient pathways (SDG 13); achieving the targets for sustainable seas and marine resources (SDG 14); and the transition towards sustainable consumption and production processes (SDG 12) (Kingdom of Sweden, 2017a). The latest in-depth evaluation of the environmental quality objectives/EQOs performed by the Swedish EPA (2019) emphasises that there is a negative trend in ecosystem recovery and biodiversity conservation (SDG 15). GHG emissions must be reduced at a faster rate, the ecological links in the landscape need to be strengthened, and the dispersion of dangerous/hazardous substances must be reduced. In 2018, Statistics Sweden was tasked by the government with setting up a national monitoring system by coordinating the development and production of statistics on Sweden’s implementation of the 2030 Agenda and making these statistics available (Government Offices of Sweden, 2018). In October 2019, Statistics Sweden carried out a statistical follow-up of the SDG actions, which includes proposals on the timing of national statistical reviews, on national indicators and on developing some statistical measures (Government Offices of Sweden, 2018).

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing Lithuania has identified combatting climate change (SDG 13), protecting oceans (SDG 14) and water resources (SDG 6), ecosystems and biodiversity (SDG 15), reducing pollution and waste (SDGs 3 and 11), and increasing resource efficiency (SDG 7) as its key priority areas for environmental sustainability (Treciokas, 2016). Lithuania’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15. The country considers climate change (SDG 13) a major threat to sustainable development. Its climate change mitigation policy is based on the sustainable development of energy from renewable resources and energy efficiency (SDG 7). In 2016, the country announced that its energy production from renewable sources accounted for more than half of the total electricity and heat production (Trečiokas, 2016). In October 2013, Lithuania approved the priorities for research and experimental development and innovation, with a breakthrough expected in 2022. The priorities cover the areas of energy, agri-innovation, biotechnology, transport, information and communication technology, new production processes and a creative society (Government of Lithuania, 2018). Lithuania prioritises the sustainable development of cities and communities (SDG 11). It is currently developing a new general territory plan that will integrate the SDGs. This plan will become the key instrument for ensuring inclusive and sustainable urban development, reducing the socio-economic exclusion of cities and the negative impact of built-up territories on the environment, and securing the protection of natural and cultural heritage (Government of Lithuania, 2018). The Ministry of Environment is the focal point for progressing towards the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD) and the 2030 Agenda. An Interinstitutional Working Group on Sustainable Development was established by the ministry, bringing together experts from various line ministries and civil society organisations. This Group, in cooperation with other national authorities, supports the Ministry of Environment in preparing NSSD progress reviews for presentation to the National Commission on Sustainable Development (NCSD). The NCSD is chaired by the prime minister and includes representatives from line ministries, as well as civil society, academia and the private sector (Government of Lithuania, 2018; Statistics Lithuania (LS), 2017a). There is also a commitment to further strengthen dialogue with the private sector and local stakeholders to achieve policy coherence at all levels. The Association of Local Authorities in Lithuania (ALAL) is involved in the national adaptation of the 2030 Agenda. Civil society and the private sector are represented in both the NCSD and the Interinstitutional Working Group on Sustainable Development (Government of Lithuania, 2018). Lithuania aims to align its sectoral strategies with the SDGs and has begun to assess the coherence of its NSSD with the 2030 Agenda. After the assessment, a public discussion will take place between the relevant institutions and non-governmental stakeholders to identify the priority areas and relevant SDG targets (UNECE, 2016). The NSSD is operationalised through four-year government action programmes, the current programme covering the period 2017-2020. A 2016-2017 mapping of the SDGs showed very close alignment between the 2030 Agenda and the NSSD. In addition, Lithuania will update its National Progress Strategy Lithuania 2030 to better reflect the SDGs (Government of Lithuania, 2018). Lithuania submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. LS collects national data indicators related to sustainable development. A dedicated working group was established to analyse the official SDG indicators and map their correlation with nationally available data (LS, 2017a). Lithuania’s NSSD identified a set of 84 national sustainable development indicators. LS then updated this list in August 2017, in cooperation with other ministries and institutions. The national list of SDG indicators will be updated annually (LS, 2017b). In addition, the biennial NSSD reports will analyse the sustainable development data and provide relevant policy recommendations (UNECE, 2016) The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to or scan the QR code.

Briefing Denmark initiated its SDG implementation by setting up an Interministerial Group on Sustainable Development to ensure coordination among all relevant institutions and stakeholders. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for coordinating the national implementation of the SDGs, while line ministries are responsible for designing policies that address the SDGs, as appropriate. The Ministry of Finance is also responsible for EU follow-up to maintain a holistic approach and create linkages to the national follow-up, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for the SDGs in the context of the UN and other international forums. Both Ministries coordinate their efforts closely (Danish Government, 2017). Denmark’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses on SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15. The government recognises the importance of making the SDGs concrete and actionable. In 2017, the country adopted its Action Plan on the implementation and follow up of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. The Plan is centred on the 5ps: prosperity, people, planet, peace and partnerships and was formulated according to the need to adapt SDG targets to national circumstances. It reflects the government’s ambition to prioritise SDG actions (Danish Government, 2017). Under the ‘planet’ cluster, Denmark considers itself as a front-runner in the transition to a green economy (SDG8), sustainable use of natural resources and energy efficiency (SDG 7). The government is dedicated to continuing an ambitious and efficient green transition while, at the same time, ensuring jobs and competitiveness (SDG 8). It acknowledges the need to further reduce GHG emissions (SDG 13). Denmark also aims to continue to prevent and limit the spread of contaminating agents that are harmful to human health (SDG 3), and to maintain a strong agriculture and food industry (SDG 2) that continues to focus on sustainability and resource efficiency (SDG 15). Having a rich biodiversity, Denmark aims to promote opportunities to enjoy nature, to prioritise the protection of marine life (SDG 14) and to stop the regression of biological diversity (SDG 15). In this context, the government has set out 10 concrete national targets on biological diversity; the protection of the marine environment; preventing and limiting contamination with harmful agents; sustainable cities; the circular economy; sustainable companies and products; sustainable food; a reduction in GHG emissions; and renewable energy (Danish Government, 2017). Denmark submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. Denmark has also selected water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), a green economy, green growth, and resource efficiency (SDG 12) as its priority areas for sustainable development (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2017). The government is working on legislative proposals on the SDGs and plans to establish an SDG fund on external action. Denmark also recognises the need for all civil society actors to contribute to achieving the SDGs (Danish Government, 2017). The Danish Action Plan is complemented by 37 national targets and measurable, quantifiable national SDG indicators. The Interministerial Group on Sustainable Development explores possible modalities and constraints in the national follow-up and reporting mechanisms (Danish Government, 2017). Since 2018, Denmark has produced an annual progress report on the Action Plan and its 37 national targets. This report gives a summary of SDG implementation and identifies the necessary adjustments to the existing implementation plans. The progress report is publicly available and is submitted to the Danish Parliament. In addition, the government will present a status report every four years. This status report will include the same elements as the progress report but may also may contain information on existing and potential initiatives to achieve the SDGs (Danish Government, 2017).

It developed a National Action Plan for 2018-2020 for action towards Agenda 2030. The plan prioritizes certain aspects of the 2030 Agenda. The High-Level Group (HLG) for the 2030 Agenda leads the coordination of all SDG-related issues in Spain with representatives from line ministries. Spain created the Office of High Commissioner for the 2030 Agenda to oversee progress on sustainable development. The high commissioner reports directly to the president and receives technical support from the Office of the High Commissioner for the 2030 Agenda (Government of Spain, 2018). Spain submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. Civil society is actively involved in SDG actions, with representatives from the municipalities and regions forming part of the HLG.

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing Liechtenstein`s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15. The Liechtenstein government is committed to an environmentally friendly approach to agriculture, as climate change is likely to pose the greatest risk to Liechtenstein’s agricultural sector. Liechtenstein has committed to reducing its carbon emissions to 40 % compared to 1990 levels (SDG 13). It recognises that an active climate policy can create the right incentives for the development and use of climate-friendly, sustainable and innovative technologies (Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, 2019). Access to clean, modern and affordable energy is a priority for Liechtenstein (SDG 8) and a 2050 Energy Vision is currently being drawn up to achieve this goal. The government has also created stronger incentives for more efficient and less environmentally harmful resource management. Environmental taxes have increased and appear to have had some effect on consumption and production patterns (SDG 12) (Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, 2019). The country is committed to global environmental protection and nature conservation and participates in close regional cooperation within Europe. Measures on the conservation of biodiversity (SDG 15) have either been implemented or are planned for the future. In 2017, the country launched ‘Waterfootprint Liechtenstein’, the rationale of which is ‘drink tap water; donate drinking water’ (SDG 6). The project aims to provide access to high-quality water for every resident of the Principality of Liechtenstein — i.e. to improve the living conditions of around 38 000 people in need. To date, a total of 22 009 ‘water footprints’ have been activated in Liechtenstein (Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, 2019). The government established an Interdisciplinary Working Group led by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Justice and Culture. The Group is tasked with performing a gap analysis of the level of SDG action to ensure implementation and reviewing the availability of data for tracking progress (UN HLPF, 2019). The government also decided to define the SDGs together with the 2017-2021 Government Programme as one of the strategic guidelines for its work. It aims to ensure SDG action is as broad as possible (Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, 2019). Liechtenstein submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. The National Statistical Office (Amt für Statistik) maintains a national indicator system for sustainable development comprising a total of 55 indicators; it is published annually.

Briefing In this context, it has defined priority areas, including raising awareness of all aspects of the transition and a comprehensive approach to reducing GHG emissions (SDG 13); the use of renewable energy sources (SDG 7); and the development of sustainable mobility (SDG 9) (Government of Republic of Slovenia, 2020). Slovenia`s priority areas in SDGs with an environmental dimension are SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Statistics place Slovenia below the EU average when it comes to three types of productivity — material, energy and emissions — as well as monitoring circularity in the use of resources (EU + the UK: 11.7, Slovenia: 8.5 – in 2017). In the long run, this makes Slovenia vulnerable because of its dependency on imported raw materials. Therefore, one of its four priority areas is the transition to a low-carbon economy (Government of Republic of Slovenia, 2020). In cooperation with the European Institutes of Innovation and Technology (EIT Climate-KIC and EIT Raw Materials) and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), Slovenia has prepared a comprehensive programme for its transition to a carbon-free society, which represents a model example at the EU level. The connection between transitioning to a circular economy and achieving climate neutrality is partly included in the National Energy and Climate Plan of the Republic of Slovenia and will also play an important role in developing new strategies for industrial climate neutrality and amending the Smart Specialization Strategy. Slovenia also considers SDG 14 as a priority area on preserving the biodiversity of land, marine and inland aquatic ecosystems. Its Spatial Development Strategy of Slovenia until 2050 puts the spotlight on the new role of cities, including green city systems and sustainable mobility systems and a healthy urban life (SDG 11) (Government of Republic of Slovenia, 2020). The Slovenian Development Strategy 2030 is the country’s umbrella development framework proposing a high quality of life for all. Slovenia incorporated the SDGs into its Development Strategy 2030 with the active participation of relevant stakeholders and vulnerable groups from local, regional and national bodies, civil society and businesses. The country’s National Development Strategy 2030 aims to strike a balance between a resilient, inclusive, and responsible society, economic growth that is inclusive and green, and a well-preserved natural environment (Government of Slovenia, 2017). Slovenia submitted two VNRs to the UN in 2017 and 2020. Slovenia established an Interdepartmental Working Group for Development Policies, which aims to link existing capacity on sustainable development and ensure horizontally integrated interdepartmental cooperation between ministries, government institutions and other key agencies (Government Office for Development and European Cohesion Policy, 2017).

As regards nature as its future capital, Latvia prioritises the use of location as capital, together with creating its image as a green country (Cross-Sectoral Coordination Centre - CSCC, 2018). Latvia’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 7, 8, 9, 14 and 15. In Latvia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Consultative Council for Cooperation on Development are responsible for sustainable development cooperation and planning. Regular Council meetings constitute the main platform for implementation of the 2030 Agenda (CSCC, 2018). The CSCC is the primary body for development planning in Latvia and the focal point for the SDGs. It is overseen by the prime minister (CSCC, 2018) and includes representatives from all line ministries, the Latvian Platform for Development Cooperation (LAPAS), the Latvian Association of Local and Regional Governments, the Latvian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Employers’ Confederation of Latvia, the Latvian Rectors’ Council, the European Affairs Committee of the Latvian Parliament, the State Chancellery, and the Latvian School of Public Administration. There are plans to strengthen the Council, expand its membership, and establish new working groups, as appropriate (UNECE, 2016). The CSCC created an informal advisory working group for the SDGs, comprising representatives from relevant line ministries, local governments, civil society associations, international partners, and other relevant stakeholders. In Latvia, planning and policy are decentralised, which means that local authorities are critical to SDG actions. All local governments in Latvia have adopted sustainable development strategies which identify key issues, goals and plans. Many efforts at the local level are organised by the Latvian Association of Local and Regional Governments. The largest NGO umbrella organisation in Latvia is Alliance-Latvia which brings together organisations working on implementing the SDGs (CSCC, 2018). Latvia submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018). The Latvian National Development Plan 2014-2020 (NDP2020) is the overarching planning document for SDG action. The NDP2020 is supported by several policy frameworks and plans that set out how to achieve the SDGs (CSCC, 2018). In 2017, Latvia launched a public discussion on tracking progress towards the NDP2020 to promote the development and engagement of non-profits and civil society (Pārresoru koordinācijas centrs (PKC, 2017). The Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) oversees the gathering and publication of national data indicators. It estimates that data are available for approximately 37 % of the SDG indicators.

Investing in waste management and recycling (SDG 12), reducing GHG emissions and adaptation to climate change (SDG 13) are the other priorities. As regards SDGs with an environmental dimension, the country focuses primarily on good health and well-being (SDG 3); affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); decent work and economic growth (SDG 8); industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9); and life below water (SDG 14) (Republic of Cyprus, 2017). In addressing SDGs with an environmental dimension, Cyprus focuses primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14. Cyprus assigned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to coordinate relevant line ministries and other governmental institutions (e.g. the Statistical Service of Cyprus) to oversee the alignment of future national strategies with the 2030 Agenda. The Directorate General for European Programmes, Coordination and Development engages with the private sector, in cooperation with many other stakeholders (Republic of Cyprus, 2017). The country established an Interministerial Committee to prepare a strategic policy framework on the applicability of the SDGs in Cyprus. The Committee investigated possible interlinkages with existing initiatives and identified national priorities within the 2030 Agenda. Cyprus now has implementation plans in place for most of the SDGs (UNECE, 2016). To reinforce cooperation among all stakeholders, Cyprus conducted a nationwide online survey on SDG priorities. An extensive public information campaign will follow in the coming years (UNECE, 2016). Cyprus notes the importance of engaging with local authorities to create ownership of and involvement in the 2030 Agenda. Further activities are planned in all areas of cooperation, including engagement with local authorities in implementing the 2030 Agenda (Republic of Cyprus, 2017). Cyprus submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017.

Croatia’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15. According to an EEA report, Croatia is one of three countries with the highest cumulative share of damage to GDP from extreme weather and climate events. It has therefore recognised the need to take a strategic approach to climate change adaptation (SDG 13) and to develop innovative solutions (SDG 9) for sustainable development. This awareness saw Croatia develop its first climate change adaptation strategy (Government of the Republic of Croatia, 2019). Since sustainable tourism is vital, Croatia is prioritising preservation of the natural environment (SDG 15) to ensure long-term sustainable growth. In recent years, marine tourism has become a fast-growing sector and the Croatian government has focused on regulating the maritime sector to ensure the highest environmental and maritime safety standards (SDG 14) (Kostelac, 2017). Safe and environmentally sustainable maritime transport, infrastructure and the maritime domain is another strategic goal (UN DESA, 2018). Croatia also plans to transition towards the use of alternative fuels for transport connections to its islands, thereby contributing to the reduction of emissions from marine transport (SDG 13) (Kostelac, 2017). Croatia designated the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs as its national coordinator for SDG actions. The Ministry established a working group on SDGs, followed by an ‘Environment Action Plan 2016-2024’ in line with the goals of the environmental SDGs. In May 2016, Croatia launched a project to develop its national climate adaptation strategy (ESDN, 2017). The government is receiving increasing levels of interest and cooperation from its major national stakeholder groups towards achieving the 2030 Agenda (Kostelac, 2017). Croatia submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. In early 2019, Croatia established the Information System for Strategic Planning and Development Management to effectively track the progress on SDG actions. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics designed an internet portal (modelled on the UN portal Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform) to share results and the status of SDG key indicators with the wider public (Government of the Republic of Croatia, 2019).

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing Achieving the SDGs in Serbia is indivisible from the process of its accession to the EU. Set out in the National Plan for Adoption of the EU Acquis from 2018 to 2021, special attention is paid to harmonization with the EU acquis, international standards, and implementation of agreements on six priority areas, including agriculture, environmental protection and climate change as well as energy and industry (Republic of Serbia, 2019). Serbia’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses mainly on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15. According to a public survey, many young people in Serbia (80 %) believe that environmental protection should be among the government’s key priorities. In discussions and the overall prioritization process of the EU Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) 2019 and 2020 programming, the key areas identified for support in the coming years are environmental protection and climate change. Furthermore, there is a special focus on continuing the investments in infrastructure for processing waste as well as those in the reconstruction and modernization of public facilities as part of efforts to improve energy efficiency (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 9, 12 and 13). In addition, Serbia considers the preservation of biodiversity (SDG 15) as the most important SDG with an environmental dimension as it poses an obligation towards both the present and future generations. The country also recognizes that circular economy plays a major role in supporting SDG action, particularly on SDGs 9, 11, 12 and 13 (Republic of Serbia, 2019). At the local level, due to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, emergency management and local resilience to natural disaster risk reduction are becoming a priority among the local communities (SDGs 11, 13). A possible mechanism for achieving greater sustainability in cities is ‘local green councils’ to assist in decision-makers in respect of local acts affecting environmental protection (Republic of Serbia, 2019). Serbia submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. Serbia established an Interministerial Working Group with representatives from the relevant ministries and tasked with proposing guidelines and measures for achieving the 2030 Agenda (UNECE, 2016).

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing For ‘planet’, the country has prioritized SDGs 2, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, with three themes and 17 national strategic goals (UN DESA, 2017). The strategic goals include halting the loss of biodiversity (SDGs 2, 6, 12, 14 and 15) by safeguarding the conservation status of species and habitats in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; halting the spread of invasive alien species; increasing terrestrial and maritime protected areas and ensuring their effective management; protecting and restoring genetic resources and natural ecosystems linked to farming, forestry and aquaculture; and mainstreaming natural capital accounting in planning, programming and national accounting (Ministry for the Environment Land and Sea - IMELS, 2017). Italy’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension prioritize SDGs 2, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Italy’s strategic goal to ensure the sustainable management of natural resources (SDG 6, 11, 12, 13 and 15) includes providing biologically diverse and dynamic seas and preventing impacts on maritime and coastal environments; halting soil consumption and combatting desertification; minimizing pollutant loads in soils, water bodies and aquifers; considering the good ecological status of natural systems; implementing integrated water-resource management at all levels; maximizing water efficiency and adjusting withdrawals to water scarcity, minimizing emissions and reducing concentrations of air pollutants; and ensuring sustainable forest management and combatting forest abandonment and degradation (IMELS, 2017). To create resilient communities and territories, protect landscapes and cultural heritage (SDGs 2, 6, 9, 11, 13 and 15), the country aims to prevent anthropogenic and environmental risk and strengthen urban and territorial resilience; to guarantee high environmental performances of buildings, infrastructures and open spaces; to boost urban regeneration; ensure sustainable urban accessibility and mobility; to ensure ecosystem restoration and defragmentation; strengthen ecological urban-rural connections, as well as developing their potential; and the sustainable management of territories, landscapes and cultural heritage (IMELS). Italy started to align its development policies to the 2030 Agenda by preparing a harmonious ‘National Sustainable Development Strategy 2017-2030’ (NSDS). The NSDS was approved by the Council of Ministers in October 2017 and adopted by the Interministerial Committee for Economic Programming (CIPE) in late December of the same year (IMELS, 2017a) (CIPE, 2017). Preparation of a specific action plan is ongoing. The International Development Cooperation (Agenzia Italiana per la Cooperazione allo Sviluppo, AICS) adopted the content and structure of the 2030 Agenda as an activity framework, as confirmed in the ‘Three-Year Programming and Policy Planning Document 2017-2019’ (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, 2018). Italy has put civil society engagement and consultation with public/private institutions at the core of its NSDS process, with more than 200 NGOs involved in reflecting the vision of the 2030 Agenda in the NSDS (IMELS, 2017). The IMELS established a Sustainable Development Forum which involves civil society, local authorities and experts on the various themes related to progress towards the NSDS (IMELS, 2017b). The Forum’s activities started in December 2019. In addition, the Italian Alliance for Sustainable Development (Alleanza Italiana per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile, ASviS), established in 2016, brings together a large number of civil society institutions and networks, universities and research institutions to raise awareness and mobilize Italian society in order to implement the Agenda 2030 and to achieve the SDGs; it regularly reports on them (IMELS, 2017). Italy submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. In May 2019, the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) and the Regional and Provincial Environmental Agencies Network launched the Agenda 2030 Task Force which aims to coordinate and harmonize their activities related to supporting regional and provincial strategies. In June 2019, the Italian Council of Ministers Presidency established a coordination body — Cabina di regia ‘Benessere Italia’ — to strengthen and coordinate policies and initiatives for fair and sustainable wellness and implementation of the NSDS (Governo Italiano-Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri, 2019). In 20018, the IMELS launched a working group (of relevant ministries, ISPRA and Italian National Institute of Statistics, ISTAT) to select a core set of indicators for tracking progress on NSDS. The final report was submitted to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers for their follow-up in July 2019. ISTAT is responsible for collecting the indicators proposed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDGs. In 2017, it began inter-institutional comparative work, in the framework of National Statistical System, to produce a methodologically consistent, integrated and shared mapping and assessment of the overall availability of indicators for SDGs (ISTAT, 2019).

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing Bulgaria's focus on progressing towards the SDGs with environmental action mainly lies in air quality (SDGs 3 and 11), water management (SDG 6), marine protection (SDG 14) and protection of nature and biodiversity (SDG 15). The country is also focusing on establishing a green and energy-efficient economy (SDG 7) (BGRF, 2016) (Plevneliev, 2016). Bulgaria adopted an approach for the whole government which takes into account the interlinkages between the SDGs. In advancing its SDG action, Bulgaria focuses on 10 SDGs with an environmental dimension (SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15). Bulgaria's first VNR in 2020 outlines some of the initiatives undertaken towards achieving the SDGs. By the end of 2020, the Council of Ministers will adopt the National Development Programme BULGARIA 2030 which will address three main strategic goals: accelerated economic development, demographic upswing, and a reduction in inequalities. The Programme will outline 13 national priorities in five development areas. A ‘Green and Sustainable Bulgaria’ is among these development areas, in which a circular and low-carbon economy (SDGs 7, 8, 12), clean air and biodiversity (SDGs 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), and sustainable agriculture (SDGs 2, 14, 15) will be addressed (UN DESA, 2020). The Programme reflects the approach of the whole government to sustainable development and considers the interlinkages between the SDGs (Republic of Bulgaria, 2020). In drafting the VNR, the Bulgarian government involved multi stakeholders from civil society, marginalised groups, business and academia. Wider public feedback was also sought through an online consultation process (UN DESA, 2019). Bulgaria submitted a VNR to the UN in 2020. The VNR also states that the biggest challenge to successfully integrating the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of Bulgaria's sustainable development policies is the coal sector which still has a significant share of the country’s energy balance. The reasons for this are related to job retention and greater energy security for the country. A solution to this problem is being sought through the preparation of the Integrated national energy and climate plan. This plan covers the five dimensions of the Energy Union for Europe: decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, Internal Energy Market and research, innovation, and competitiveness (Republic of Bulgaria, 2020).

Its environmental priorities centre on the transition from biomass to renewable energy for household heating (SDG 7); the management of natural protected areas; and sustainable forest management and forest ecosystems (SDG 15) (Ministry of Environment of Romania, 2018). Romania prioritises SDGs 6, 7, 11 and 12 with an environmental dimension. Romania, as the largest country in the Danube basin, also contributes to developing and updating the Danube River Basin Management Plan. The purpose is to enhance the quality of life and avoid environmental decline by using smart technologies to ensure the sustainable development of communities. Romania focuses its attention on reducing the discharge of nutrient loads into the Danube basin and the Black Sea (SDG 14)(Petcu, 2017). The country has also explored synergies between the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement (SDG 13) and the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (Gavrilescu, 2017). In Romania, oversight of sustainable development is shared between two entities. The first is the Department for Sustainable Development, under the prime minister’s office, which was created in April 2017 and has been assigned primary responsibility for implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The second is the Interministerial Committee for the Coordination of the Integration of Environmental Protection into Sectoral Policies and Strategies (Interministerial Committee), which has managed sustainable development initiatives in Romania, led by the Minister of Environment (Ministry of Environment of Romania, 2018). In November 2008, Romania adopted its National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS), ‘Horizon 2013-2020-2030’. The country is currently in the process of mapping the SDGs and determining how best to achieve synergies for appropriate SDG action (Ministry of Environment, 2018). The NSDS proposes to establish a Coalition for Sustainable Development, which would act as an NGO and advocate for the SDGs (Ministry of Environment, 2018). Romania submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. The Department for Sustainable Development is collaborating closely with the National Institute of Statistics to monitor Romania’s progress on the SDGs. Romania is currently updating its sustainable development indicator set, as part of both the revised NSDS and the forthcoming National Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) (Ministry of Environment of Romania, 2018). Romania recognises the SDG action should respond directly to citizens’ needs at the local level. Local communities’ needs will be addressed by formulating local and national development strategies (Dulceata, 2017). In 2017 and 2018, Romania organised a series of conferences and seminars to raise awareness of the SDGs and promote participation. Some events were specifically designed to include civil society organisations. Approximately 33 communities have completed Local Sustainable Development Strategies (Ministry of Environment of Romania, 2018).

Briefing Ireland acknowledges that the detrimental effects of climate change are most acutely felt by the most vulnerable in society by undermining their well-being and ability to cope (SDGs 13, 3) (Doyle, 2017). As a small island nation with a relatively large marine territory, Ireland considers its relationship with the marine environment critical to social, environmental, and economic activities (Doyle, 2017). It therefore prioritises SDG 14 (life below water) and has put in place a National Integrated Maritime Plan to manage its marine resources to integrate economic, environmental and social priorities with the SDGs (Breen, 2017). Ireland’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 12, 13 and 14. The National Development Plan 2018-2027 provides for EUR 116 billion in capital investment over 10 years. Of this, EUR 21.8 billion is allocated to SDG-related projects, including those on renewable energy and energy security (SDG 7) (Government of Ireland, 2018). In 2017, the Government established the National Sustainable Development Unit to carry out those responsibilities. The SDG-specific government entity, the Senior Officials’ Group (SOG) on the SDGs was established to provide support, oversee SDG action and report to the Cabinet. Chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, it is made up of assistant secretaries from all government departments and receives support from the National Sustainable Development Unit and the SDG Interdepartmental Working Group. Each ministry is responsible for the SDG targets in its field of action (Government of Ireland, 2018). Ireland established a national SDG Stakeholder Forum, chaired by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, to facilitate dialogue among representatives from government entities, civil society, NGOs, the private sector, trade unions and academia. Other networks have also facilitated collaboration on the SDGs, such as Coalition 2030, an alliance of over 100 civil society organisations, and Business in the Community Ireland (Government of Ireland, 2018). In 2018, Ireland adopted its first SDG National Implementation Plan for the period 2018-2020 (Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, 2018). The Plan integrates the 2030 Agenda into national policies and identifies the government ministries and agencies responsible for each of the SDG targets. The SDG National Implementation Plan builds on Ireland’s current national sustainable development strategy, ‘Our Sustainable Future’ and its policy for international development, ‘One World, One Future’, and commits Ireland to mainstreaming the SDGs across national policy (UN DESA, 2018). Ireland submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. The government has mandated the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to lead tracking progress towards the SDGs. It is responsible for data collection, analysis, and publication. Ireland has a national for the dissemination of information on the SDGs. The Geohive is its public platform for exploring, downloading, and combining publicly available data relating to the UN and the EU SDGs. Developed as part of a collaborative project between the CSO and Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Geohive utilises state-of-the-art geospatial technology, made available by Esri Ireland, to map Ireland's progress against each goal, using a set of globally and EU-agreed Indicators. This new approach for tracking SDG progress was presented to the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the UN on 18 July 2018 (UN DESA, 2018).

This vast analytical work has been synthesised into a situation analysis and three development pathways until 2030, along with corresponding accelerators and drivers (Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2019). Bosnia and Herzegovina’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus on SDGs 6, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Bosnia and Herzegovina clusters its SDG implementation into the ‘5ps’: people, prosperity, planet, peace, partnership. Under the ‘planet’ cluster, it aims to achieve protection from degradation, changes in consumption and production patterns, the sustainable management of natural resources and urgent action on climate change through implementation of SDGs 6, 12, 13, 14 and 15 (Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2019). On SDG 6, Bosnia and Herzegovina is working towards the protection and sustainable use of water resources to ensure that drinking water is accessible to all. For SDG 12, it envisages activities focused on better use of environmental principles in business operations and respect for the principle of energy efficiency. On SDG 13, the emphasis is on taking urgent action to combat the impacts of climate change on the country. On SDG 14, Bosnia and Herzegovina aims to tackle the issue of ballast waters from maritime transport (recognised as the main vectors behind the spread of invasive species in the Adriatic Sea), as the introduction of invasive species and the loss of biodiversity further threaten tourism and fishing activities, including in coastal areas. On SDG 15, Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to implement activities aimed at the sustainable management of forests, combatting desertification, halting and reversing land degradation and halting biodiversity loss. The Directorate for Economic Planning is the leading body for implementation of the SDGs (Oprašić, 2016). Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. In October 2016, the UN in Bosnia and Herzegovina launched ‘Imagine2030’ (Zamisli 2030), an umbrella initiative to advocate, promote and engage citizens with the SDGs and to create a consultation tool for them (Oprašić, 2016).

Briefing As it considers economic growth, social development and climate change adaptation and mitigation to be interlinked with sustainable industry and technological progress, it also prioritises SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure). Portugal’s ‘Action Plan for a Circular Economy’ is key to the necessary new sustainable society model (SDG 12) (Republic of Portugal). Portugal identifies SDGs 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 as environmental priority areas. The Ministry of Environment and Climate Action defined its action strategy based on three key pillars: promoting the circularity of the economy (SDG 12); when valuing the nature in land (SDG 15); and being on track to carbon neutrality (SDG 13). The Ministry reinforced the intersectoral and cross-cutting environmental public policy with a permanent dialogue with all stakeholders and several levels of the administration, enabling a continuous evaluation to better optimise the appropriate level of SDG actions. Therefore, the country also considers partnerships (SDG17) are essential and key for environmental action. Portugal attaches importance to breaking the silos within and among government and other public institutions, at both the national and local level, as well as engaging with civil society in this process. The important level of public awareness, namely with NGOs, academia or local authorities’ interventions, oblige complete transparency in actions and guarantees permanent public evaluation by the media. Pre-existing social and political structures and processes on sustainable development as well as strong political support and active civil society engagement have enabled Portugal to respond to most of the SDG targets. Portugal submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. In 2016, the Portuguese Council of Ministers adopted Intra-Governmental Guidelines for the 2030 Agenda and established the Focal Point Network comprising representatives from different public institutions. Within this structure, each ministry was designated as being responsible for the relevant SDGs. In 2016, when this coordination mechanism was created, the Ministry of Environment was appointed as responsible for SDGs 6, 11, 12 and 13. A public consultation on SDG action at the national and local level also took place that year, along with an online survey intended to reach a wider audience and provide an opportunity for every citizen to participate (Republic of Portugal, 2017). In line with existing practice in the Ministry of Environment and Climate Action, the 2030 Agenda adoption has improved all the ministry’s partners awareness of the interdependency of sectorial and regional policies, smoothing the necessary common decision-making processes. The main environmental instruments have benefitted from this new vision, allowing more extensive intersectoral and public discussions and improved ownership of the Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality, the Action Plan for a Circular Economy, the National Plan for Energy and Climate, the National Program for Spatial Planning, and the National Strategy for Nature Conservation and Biodiversity. The country’s baseline analysis on SDG progress began with the collection of data and information in relation to the SDGs (Republic of Portugal, 2017). As a result, the National Statistical Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estatística) mapped the available information and identified the most appropriate sources of indicators for tracking SDGs progress. The next step for the government includes the consolidation of this work, improving the robustness of the existing indicators, developing calculation methods for the missing indicators, the possibility of introducing qualitative indicators (Republic of Portugal, 2017).

They include: improved resource efficiency in consumption and production and decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation (SDG 8); reducing the adverse per-capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management (SDG 11); restructuring taxation and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies to reflect their environmental impacts (SDG 12); and integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning (SDG 13) (Prime Minister’s Office, 2019). The Interministerial Working Group mapped Iceland’s position on all 169 targets and specified 65 priority targets which include conservation of the natural environment and combatting climate change. With respect to climate change (SDG 13), the government aims to build partnerships to address the large environmental footprint of modern lifestyles. Iceland is still a net contributor to climate change but is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2040 (Prime Minister’s Office, 2019). The government will also undertake actions to further develop the bioeconomy, green solutions, and methods to reduce the environmental impact of food production by means of incentives and support for carbon offsetting (among others) in the sector (SDG 2). Other actions include strengthening organic farming and highlighting the uniqueness of Icelandic raw materials cultivated under sustainable conditions (Prime Minister’s Office, 2019). Iceland’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Iceland attaches vital importance to life below water (SDG 14) and prioritises its actions. To protect the marine environment, it has made voluntary commitments to reduce marine litter in its waters. Iceland held the co-chairmanship of the ‘Increasing Scientific Knowledge and Developing Research Capacity and Transfer of Marine Technology’ partnership at the UN Ocean Conference in June 2017. It has also committed to implementing a harvest control rule to manage commercially important fish stocks in Icelandic waters (Gunnarsdottir, 2017). The government’s fiscal strategy focuses on sustainable productivity, a reduction in GHG emissions, monitoring risk factors, and green solutions for the environment. In recent years, Iceland has paid special attention to integrating gender perspectives into environmental and climate issues and is committed to supporting specific measures to promote the position of women in this field. In particular, the Icelandic government has supported the SEforALL’s People-Centered Accelerator platform which is intended to promote gender equality and emphasises the social participation and promotion of women in the energy sector globally (SDG 7)(Prime Minister’s Office, 2019). Iceland initiated SDG action in 2016 through a gap analysis on available information on sustainable development. It subsequently issued a status report on the SDGs, including extensive work on the analysis and prioritisation of SDGs, targets and indicators. This report served as the basis for Iceland’s National Action Plan for Sustainable Development (NORDEN, 2017). In March 2017, the government appointed a working group represented by the Prime Minister’s Office, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources, the Ministry of Welfare, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, and Statistics Iceland. This Interministerial Working Group manages the analysis, action, and promotion of the SDGs. To ensure the involvement of all ministries, a contact group was also formed, comprising representatives of other ministries and an observer from the Association of Local Authorities in Iceland (Prime Minister’s Office, 2019). Iceland submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. The Group mapped Iceland’s position on all 169 targets and specified 65 priority targets to guide authorities for SDG action. In 2019, the SDG Working Group launched an information portal, offering citizens, NGOs, companies, institutions, municipalities and others the opportunity to present projects that contribute to the promotion of the SDGs (Prime Minister’s Office, 2019).

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing The Belgian Constitution lays down that every federal entity should pursue sustainable development objectives in its social, economic and environmental dimensions, taking into account solidarity between the generations. The federal entities are on an equal footing but have powers and responsibilities in different fields. Belgium is focusing on all SDGs, working through overarching strategies to address interlinkages. The country’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension lies primarily in SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 16. Progress towards the 2030 Agenda relies on a variety of existing sustainable development strategies adopted by the respective levels of government. At the federal level, the strategy encompasses a Long-term Vision (LTV, approved in 2013) and the Federal Plan for Sustainable Development (approved in 2008). At the regional level, key strategic frameworks include: the 2nd Walloon Sustainable Development Strategy (approved in 2016); the Flemish Vision 2050 (a long-term strategy for Flanders, approved in 2016) and Focus 2030 (Flanders’ goals for 2030, preliminarily approved in 2018); the Brussels-Capital Region’s Regional Sustainable Development plan (approved in 2013); and the German-speaking Community’s second regional development plan (approved in 2014). To achieve the NSDS and promote coherence in the implementation of sustainable development policy in Belgium, an Interministerial Conference for Sustainable Development (IMCSD) was established in 2012 and revitalised in 2015. The IMCSD is mandated to follow up implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Belgium (UN DESA, 2017). The updated NSDS was approved in 2017, following a civil consultation process with the relevant stakeholders. It provides the umbrella framework for the main government stakeholders at both federal and federated levels to combine their efforts to achieve the SDGs. The NSDS sets out how the various authorities in Belgium should cooperate and link their strategies to ensure they are coherent with the SDGs (UN DESA, 2017). The Federal Institute for Sustainable Development (FIDO-IFDD) is the main institution with responsibility for SDG actions. In collaboration with the Ministry for Sustainable Development, FIDO-IFDD has developed several pathways for SDG implementation. Flanders adopted a decree for sustainable development in September 2008. The first Flemish strategy for sustainable development was developed in 2006, largely based on the thematic priorities of the European Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS). The second Flemish strategy for sustainable development was adopted on 29 April 2011. In March 2016, the Flemish government presented its new strategic outlook for the future: ‘Vision 2050: A long-term strategy for Flanders’. Vision 2050 is designed around seven transition processes: the circular economy, smart living, Industry 4.0, lifelong learning and a dynamic professional career, caring and living together in 2050, transport and mobility, and energy. Implementation of these transition priorities will be cross-sectoral and undertaken in collaboration with innovators, entrepreneurs, and stakeholders. A new governance model was developed, inspired by transition management principles. In 2018, a preliminary set of 49 Flemish goals — based on the SDGs — was agreed by the Flemish government. This set of 2030 goals for Flanders, called ‘Focus 2030’, will be measured by a set of region-specific indicators. In 2013, the Walloon government adopted a decree on the Walloon sustainable development strategy which foresees the development of such a strategy and determines its key elements. Based on the decree — and following a first strategy adopted in October 2013 — the second Walloon sustainable development strategy was adopted on 7 July 2016. This aims to put some transition paths in place and contribute to implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. A public consultation on the LTV and action plan (first and fourth chapters of the strategy) was undertaken in 2016. In parallel, the public was invited to post commitments on the website or to identify projects that contribute to the action plan priorities and thus to the transition to sustainable development in Wallonia. The Brussels-Capital Region has undergone profound changes and is now facing new challenges, such as rapid demographic growth, employment, training and education, poverty, environment, mobility and internationalisation. Between 13 January and 13 March 2017, the Brussels government held a public inquiry into the new draft of the Regional Sustainable Development Plan. It sets priorities to make the Brussels-Capital Region more attractive, more inclusive socially and economically, more competitive, more creative in research, and greener and more efficient in its use of energy and resources. Since 2007, through its ‘Agenda Iris 21’ programme, Brussels Environment (the environmental administration in Brussels-Capital) has provided financial and methodological support to municipalities and public centres for social assistance (CPAS) implementing local Agenda 21 projects. In the German-speaking Community, the Regional Development Concept was conceived as a long-term strategy for the German-speaking government. The process was initiated in May 2008 with a comprehensive stocktaking and regional analysis to examine the Community’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges. The mission statement was published as REK (the Development Concept) volumes 1 and 2. In April 2011, the third volume detailed the initial implementation phase of the REK, comprising 16 main projects and 48 sub-projects (Living East Belgium – 2025). Belgium launched the ‘SDG Charter for International Development’ to unite the private sector, civil society and the public sector around the SDGs and international development. More than 100 companies and organisations have signed up to the Charter. Civil society made a significant contribution to Belgium’s VNR, issuing coordinated advisory opinions on the draft review (UN DESA, 2017). The Interfederal Statistical Institute (IIS) is responsible for systematically tracking progress on SDG actions. As a first step, the IIS selected the two most relevant, measurable, and available indicators per SDG ( ). The SDG indicators database will be upgraded to include more indicators from the list defined at the UN level. The NSDS established a reporting mechanism on the SDGs, with reports made to the parliament and civil society twice per government term. Civil society was also invited to report its own 2030 Agenda initiatives (UN DESA, 2017). The Belgian NSDS action plan identified several priority themes including sustainable food (SDG 2), sustainable building and housing (SDG 11), and sustainable public procurement (SDG 16) (De Croo, 2017b). Submitted to the UN in 2017, the Belgian VNR also highlights areas of further action, including water (SDGs 6 and 14) and air quality (SDG 3), energy intensity and renewable energy (SDG 7) and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (SDG 13). The Belgian government is now looking into ways to address these areas (De Croo, 2017b). Belgium submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. Belgium has identified the need for a detailed mapping of all gaps in SDG action at all levels of its federal system. Furthermore, the Federal Planning Bureau (FPB) uses the Federal Sustainable Development Reports to evaluate federal policies on sustainable development, as well as presenting foresight scenarios (FPB, 2017). At the regional level, Wallonia has published its first SDG implementation report, adopted by the Walloon government in April 2017. It includes an inventory of the Walloon strategies and plans that contribute to achieving the SDGs, an analysis of 70 selected indicators and a set of good practices by Walloon public institutions, civil society and the private sector. Flanders is currently developing a framework of indicators for its ‘Focus 2030: A 2030 objectives framework for Flanders’.

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing In achieving SDGs with an environmental dimension, Poland focuses primarily on SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13 and 15. Under the planet cluster, improving air quality in Polish cities remains a priority (SDGs 3, 11). Objectives also include achieving high water quality (SDG 6); protecting the soil against degradation (SDG 15); reducing the impact of noise and electromagnetic fields on society (SDG 3); as well as increasing available water resources (SDG 6); the sustainable management of terrestrial resources (SDG 15); and ensuring efficient waste management (SDG 12) (Government of Poland, 2018). A boost for the implementation of the environmental SDGs was the agreement on and adoption of the 2030 National Environmental Policy – the Development Strategy in the Area of the Environment and Water Management, setting several environmental priorities. Moreover, citizens have become more environmentally conscious in recent years – protecting air quality and climate change have been gaining interest. In addition, a new Ministry of Climate (MoC) was established to operate independently of the Ministry of Environment. The MoC is responsible for climate action and sustainable development issues. Sustainable water management was also transferred from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Maritime Economy and Inland Navigation. Poland has also identified areas which require further action. For example, since its energy policy has yet to be updated, this has become a priority for the current MoC (SDG 7). SDGs’ visibility and their recognition tends to be limited to experts. As regards sustainable cities (SDG 11), the main objective is to improve the quality of life and support cities in their transition towards sustainability and climate neutrality. Air quality remains another priority. The clean air programme is being amended to boost the number of investments across the country. Moreover, actions have been undertaken to improve the waste-management system and support the e-mobility sector. A reduction in GHG emissions will be pursued within financial instruments such as ‘My electricity’, ‘Agro-energy’ and ‘Polish Geothermy Plus’. New regulations to improve and harmonise the process of preparing the acoustic maps and environmental protection plans have also been introduced, although better coordination is needed both at the national and local level to consolidate all noise data and decisions. Business, private institutions, scientific and research institutions, and non-governmental organisations were included in activities aimed at developing various government strategies on SDG action with an environmental dimension. Stakeholder engagement activities included mainly consultations and workshops. For example, for the purpose of developing the 2030 National Environmental Policy, a consultation conference was organised and an online questionnaire launched. The consultation proved popular among civil society organisations. In 2017, the Ministry of Economic Development initiated the Partnership for the SDGs, inviting all stakeholders to share their experiences and activities on SDGs. Signatories to the Partnership undertake and communicate a number of initiatives, including in the area of the environment, such as striving for the highest standards of environmental protection; innovative ways of introducing the principles of the circular economy; reducing the consumption of water and other resources; environmentally safe processing and transport of raw materials; projects aiming to reduce pollution, waste and the consumption of raw materials; support for school and educational institutions in the field of environmental education; as well as the development of vehicles based on clean energy and fuel-saving practices. Within the Urban Agenda (SDG11), the MoC has planned to organise 16 regional workshops to discuss how to create greener cities, bringing together stakeholders from civil society organisations, academia and local governments. Social participation played a significant role in the development of ‘Urban Adaptation Plans for cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants in Poland’ project (SDGs 11, 13). The project’s main, in partnership with the 44 major Polish cities, was to assess their sensitivity and vulnerability to climate change and to develop priority adaptation measures adequate for the risks identified for each city (Government of Poland, 2018). Other partnerships have also been created and developed, including the UNEP/GRID-Warsaw Centre SDG Partnership ‘Together for the environment’. It initiates and implements projects addressing those SDGs with an environmental dimension. It was created to exchange ideas, experiences and good practices and build broad cooperation to achieve SDGs. Partnership activities are focused on education and raising awareness. Many different stakeholders are involved, including companies, associations of companies and chambers of commerce, research and development institutions, public administration, central and local government, non-governmental organisations, and informal initiatives as well as individuals (GRID-Warsaw in Partnership with UN Environment, 2018). Poland not only prioritises the achievement of individual goals, but also the interactions between them. To increase the effectiveness of achieving the SDGs, the country recognises the importance of education for sustainable development, effective monitoring systems, and policy coherence. It also considers that more clarity is required as regards the role of different international and European institutions in the SDGs process along with streamlining their actions (Government of Poland, 2018). Poland submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. The Council of Ministers sets out the overall sustainable development objectives and policies. Sector-specific bodies coordinate different aspects of Poland’s development strategy, including the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers (economic policy) and the Social Committee of the Council of Ministers (social issues). The Ministry of Economic Development is responsible for coordination of the 2030 Agenda. An important body under the institutional mechanism is the Coordination Committee for Development Policy, one of the prime minister’s advisory bodies. Line ministries are involved in SDG actions within their relevant areas of competence. A special Task Force for Coherence between the Strategy for Responsible Development and the 2030 Agenda was created within the Coordination Committee to prioritise the SDG targets, and facilitate dialogue and collaboration related to the 2030 Agenda and the VNR (Government of Poland, 2018). Statistics Poland oversees data collection and both the provision and creation of indicators to track SDG progress. To assess progress towards the SDGs on the global level, it coordinates the provision of data for the official UN indicators. It developed SDG indicators to track the realisation of national SDG priorities, defined by the Polish government in 2018. To complement the VNR report submitted to the UN in 2018, Statistics Poland prepared the publication ‘A picture of Poland: Statistics for SDGs’, introducing foreign readers to Poland and its role in achieving the SDGs (Statistics Poland, 2018).

Briefing National strategies and programmes supporting actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension (National Environmental Programme, National Framework Strategy on Sustainable Development, etc. and their implementation reports) are being developed through strong stakeholder involvement and consultation. Stakeholder representatives are members of the National Environmental Council and National Council on Sustainable Development. Hungary’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 13 and 15. To strengthen its commitment to environmental sustainability, Hungary established a new Directorate for Environmental Sustainability within the Office of the President in 2015. The Directorate maintains contact with national and international bodies, educational institutions, and organisations, prepares background information and supports the President’s Office in issues pertaining to sustainable development (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, 2018). Hungary deems environmental education and education on sustainability (including awareness raising among decision-makers) essential as environmental awareness is the basis for behaviour change. For this reason, the country initiated the Green Kindergarten Network, the Eco-School Network and several environmental sustainability programmes. Hungary submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. In Hungary, line ministries are responsible for SDG action within their respective domains. An Interministerial Coordination Mechanism was established in 2017 and is made up of representatives from each line ministry, the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, civil society, academia and the private sector. The National Framework Strategy on Sustainable Development (NFSSD) 2012-2024 also assigns responsibilities to municipalities in terms of the sustainable development of cities. Civil society organisations were invited to participate in the development and adoption of the NFSSD. The Business Council for Sustainable Development in Hungary also participated in the SDG national adaptation process, including the review of the VNR (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, 2018). The Hungarian Central Statistical Office has published every two years since 2007, most recently in 2015, in English (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, 2018), and in 2019, in Hungarian). Currently, data are available in Hungary for approximately 75 % of the SDG indicators. Many of Hungary’s SDG actions have faced financial barriers as it is a great challenge to find and allocate the appropriate sources. Improved sectoral integration and coordination would better facilitate the country’s actions on SDGs with an environmental dimension (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, 2018). The Hungarian government tries to involve the broad spectrum of stakeholders (civil society, businesses, scientific community, etc.) in planning and implementing the SDGs. For example, in 2018, the Hungarian VNR was the result of a comprehensive public consultation in cooperation with the Civil Roundtable for Sustainable Development Goals (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, 2018). The Climate and Environmental Protection Action Plan was announced on 16 January 2020 by the prime minister. It proposes eight action points, including waste management, The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to or scan the QR code.

In Austria, sustainable development is a constitutional state goal. It launched its SDG actions with a Decision of the Austrian Council of Ministers on January 2016, based on a national stocktaking exercise (UNECE 2016). In line with the universal nature of the 2030 Agenda, the Decision of the Council of Ministers emphasised a mainstream approach: aligning regular national policy frameworks at the sectoral level with the SDGs (taking an ‘SDG lens’) (Republic of Austria, 2020). Austria addresses the SDGs through its federal ministries in their respective areas of responsibility by integrating the SDGs into their ministerial jurisdiction of policy and administration (BKA, 2016). The Inter-Ministerial Working Group on the 2030 Agenda (IMAG) handles the general coordination and communication of SDG actions. It is chaired by the Federal Chancellery and the Ministry of Foreign affairs and involves line ministries that may be associated with SDG actions (UNECE, 2016). Following a multi-stakeholder approach, representatives of federal states, cities, municipalities, social partners, stakeholders from civil society, business and the scientific community interact with the IMAG and are committed to SDG implementation (Republic of Austria, 2020). The Austrian Court of Auditors is committed to making an active contribution to the SDGs through its audits. The SDGs have been incorporated into most of the auditing activities under the ‘sustainability and intergenerational equity’ theme (BKA, 2016). In addition, all major public policies and projects are now subject to an annual impact assessment in which ministries evaluate whether their measures and individual projects will make a significant contribution to achieving the SDGs (BKA, 2016). Austria submitted a VNR to the UN in 2020. Austria`s national statistical agency, Statistik Austria, developed a national SDG indicator set, in close consultation with the EU (BKA, 2016).

As for the crucial area of climate change, a national follow-up of the Paris Agreement will constitute the main basis for action to fulfil SDG 13. Addressing the responsible use and protection of oceans and marine environments is particularly pressing. This is important for Norway and other coastal states whose livelihoods and welfare depend on the sea (UN DESA, 2016). Recently, Norway adopted an action plan for biodiversity as a tool for achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (SDG 15) (UN DESA, 2016). After the adoption of the SDGs in September 2015, the Norwegian government developed a national plan for their implementation and follow-up. To ensure policy coherence and coordination, the Minister of Foreign Affairs established a project on the post-2015 development agenda and an Interministerial Contact Group, which analysed the SDGs in terms of their potential consequences and challenges for the country (UN DESA, 2016). Responsibility for each of the 17 SDGs has been given to a coordinating ministry which consults with other ministries to follow up various targets under the goal concerned. In each ministry, targets have been assigned to individual units, thereby distributing the responsibility for implementation of the SDGs across all levels of government (NORDEN, 2017). Norway views civil society engagement as vital to the national ownership of the 2030 Agenda. The government conducts consultations with stakeholders on SDG implementation and places emphasis on the private sector and business to achieve scaled-up implementation and financing for the 2030 Agenda (UN DESA, 2016). Norway regards participatory, inclusive, and representative decision-making as fundamental for a well-functioning society. Participation is vital for ensuring the national ownership necessary for an effective and transparent follow-up of the SDGs. As far as spreading knowledge about them is concerned, the recommendation by the Ministry of Education to include the SDGs as part of the curriculum in schools is valuable (UN DESA, 2016). Norway has begun to incorporate the global SDG indicators in its national context. It will define additional national SDG indicators, where necessary, to ensure comprehensive monitoring at the national level (UN DESA, 2016). Norway submitted a VNR to the UN in 2016. Norway has a reporting system in place for its national targets. Each year, the ministries will report their progress toward the SDGs to the Norwegian parliament (Storting) in their budget proposals. This is a vital as the annual budgets are key political documents for policymaking (UN DESA, 2016).

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing Greece identified and endorsed eight national priorities for SDG action, on which the country’s 2018 VNR was based. The sixth national priority is ‘strengthening the protection and sustainable management of natural capital as a base for social prosperity and transition to a low-carbon economy’. The policies and measures to achieve this priority include: The priority given to SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 with an environmental dimension is based on the notion that Greece’s natural environment constitutes not only the identity of the country but is also a key asset for development. Thus, environmental protection is regarded as the basis for ensuring sustainable economic growth — for example, through quality tourism and the production of quality agricultural products and food, as these two sectors are the backbone of the Greek economy and rely on the quality of the natural environment. This is also the basis for social well-being as it safeguards human health and access to high-quality environmental and ecosystem services for citizens (Hellenic Republic, 2018). Greece prioritises actions towards SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 with an environmental dimension As Greece is a maritime nation and a coastal state, shipping, fishing, development of offshore energy sources, port and transportation facilities, recreation and tourism are vital economic activities (SDG 14). The country also recognises the interlinkage between SDG 14 and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), because the health and well-being of coastal populations — especially of island communities, which are sometimes wholly dependent upon fishing and tourism — are linked to the quality of the marine environment (Kalamvrezos, 2017). Greece submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. Greece aims to revisit its overall development through an ‘SDGs lens’, hoping to boost the economy, stimulate decent employment, strengthen social protection and inclusion, and protect the environment and natural capital. The SDGs offer the country a new vision for sustainable development, ensuring the spread of prosperity and the protection of the most vulnerable and fostering economic stability founded on a sound ecological basis. It also approaches SDGs through a long-term institutional mechanism that takes an approach supported by the whole government. This includes an Interministerial Coordination Network comprising representatives from line ministries and steered by the presidency of the government which has undertaken the role of coordinating national efforts to achieve the SDGs from a long-term perspective (Hellenic Republic, 2018). To enhance transparency, partnership and accountability, actions and activities have been carried out with non-state actors. The Economic and Social Council of Greece (ESC) is the institution constitutionally responsible for conducting social dialogue among major social partners and stakeholders. Within this context, in 2017, on the request of the General Secretariat of the Government, the ESC issued an opinion entitled ‘UN 2030 Agenda - Priority Objectives for Greece’. This presented its views on the national prioritisation of the SDGs, submitting a comprehensive set of proposals regarding effective SDG actions on key economic, social and environmental aspects of the SDGs at different levels and sectors (i.e. economic growth, employment and social protection, sustainable energy, industrialization, and innovation that would create positive spillover effects for all other SDGs (Hellenic Republic, 2018). The Hellenic Statistical System (ELSS) is the set of rules, tasks and competent bodies responsible for the execution of statistical assignments, with the aim of developing, producing and disseminating official statistics. The Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) coordinates the system and is responsible for certifying the statistics of the ELSS authorities and organisations. By 2019, line ministries together with ELSTAT, had carried out three rounds of consultations and mapping to identify and select the most adequate indicators for tracking progress at the national level. A list of around 160 indicators (90 selected from the global SDGs indicator framework and 70 from Eurostat adapted to national priorities and circumstances) were selected for quantitative tracking of progress towards the SDGs. At the same time, this emphasis made for more active involvement by the national parliament from a more political and qualitative perspective in the future, allowing for political input and the ‘fine-tuning’ of priorities and a focus on any potential gaps (Hellenic Republic, 2018).

Briefing To support SDG action, Albania has prepared an SDG baseline report to explore the specific components of the National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI) pillars. Albania’s baseline report underscores that the national strategic policy framework is most harmonised with the SDG targets in SDG 3 (good health and well-being); SDG 7 (affordable and Clean Energy); SDG 8 (good jobs and economic growth); and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), while the least harmonisation is with SDG 14 (life below water) (Ciko, 2018). Albania’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 and 15. Published in 2018, Albania`s VNR identifies six key priority areas, including energy (SDG 7), water (SDGs 6, 14) and integrated land management (SDGs 11, 15) (Republic of Albania, 2018). The NSDI 2015-2020 draws up a plan for the 2030 Agenda by connecting the SDGs with its key components. Although the Albanian sustainable development agenda includes a variety of different domains, the main achievements are expected to be reforms in four main areas, including environmental protection, and competitive economy (Republic of Albania, 2016). Albania submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. The Albanian parliament formed an Interministerial Committee on the SDGs, chaired by the deputy prime minister. This Committee is responsible for ensuring dialogue between the government and stakeholders, as well as integration of the SDGs in Albania’s strategic framework (Marika, 2016). The Official Statistical Programme for 2017-2021 was approved by the parliament in February 2017 and includes a set of national SDG indicators (EUROSTAT, 2017).

Briefing Although there does not appear to be any correlation with the levels of SDG governance chosen by countries, there is , and mechanisms for tracking SDG progress. Various working groups have responsibility for activities such as: Such groups are also important for providing leadership, high-level political support, and impetus, such as that provided by the Interministerial Conference on Sustainable Development. Other actions noted in countries include designating lead ministries or institutions to coordinate the SDG process, and conducting gap analyses or mapping [ ] related to SDG actions at the national level. : EEA’s own analysis. Most Eionet countries have made efforts to align their existing indicator sets and underlying data to the . Some of these global indicators generally do not have readily available equivalent indicators at the national level. As a result, some countries have performed a mapping exercise to compare existing national indicators relevant to the SDGs and the UN SDG indicators, identify indicator and data gaps, and prepare plans to develop new indicators and collect missing data. Based on current VNR reporting, 37 out of 39 (95 %) Eionet countries already have or are developing national SDG indicator sets. At the European level, Eurostat have developed an (UN, 2017b) which includes time-series data for 99 indicators across all 17 SDGs for all EU Member States. In relation to national progress reporting, 19 (49 %) Eionet countries [ ] are already producing regular national reports on their progress towards the SDGs. Some countries report on an annual basis, whereas others do so less frequently. National SDG progress reports usually build on the national SDG indicator sets. In some cases, national SDG progress reports are produced at the same time as the VNRs. Despite shortcomings in the availability of data, some countries [ ] acknowledged that the VNR process provided an important opportunity to reassess their existing national sustainable development priorities against the SDGs and to critically evaluate the current state of SDG actions. There has been increased interest and steady progress in the number of Eionet countries submitting VNRs to the UN. To date, 37 countries have submitted a VNR: 8 countries [ ] submitted their VNRs in 2016; 10 [ ] in 2017; 12 [ ] countries in 2018; and 7 countries [ ] in 2019. Austria and Bulgaria submitted a VNR in 2020, whereas Switzerland (2016 and 2018) and Turkey (2016 and 2019) submitted two VNRs. Finland and Germany have also committed to submitting second VNRs in the future. Many countries explicitly include stakeholders from outside government within Agenda 2030 working and advisory groups. Based on Eionet countries’ VNRs, dialogue with stakeholders and their participation in prioritisation, decision-making and the implementation of SDGs is noted in 32 of the 39 countries analysed (82 %). Stakeholders consulted on SDG policies and strategies include civil society, the private sector and public and academic institutions. Online stakeholder consultation platforms, to collect feedback from the public, and web-based SDG monitoring platforms, to disseminate information on progress towards the SDGs, have been developed in eight countries (21 % of the 39 analysed) [ ]. Stakeholders are also important in the implementation of SDGs. Examples include voluntary commitments from civil society and businesses to support actions towards achieving the (Office of the Government of the Czech Republic, 2017), and emphasis in Norway on scaling-up implementation and financing for Agenda 2030 through the active participation of the private sector. Of the 39 countries analysed, 29 [ ] (74 %) have set up interministerial bodies, advisory councils, commissions or working groups to coordinate SDG actions among their relevant institutions. In addition to government ministries and agencies, these groups often include other relevant stakeholders, such as regional and local governments, civil society and business associations. The remaining countries have established governance coordination within a specific national government department or agency.

Briefing Based on an analysis of the VNRs [ ] [ ] on SDG progress and action for those SDGs with an environmental dimension (Figure 1), 27 [ ] of 39 Eionet countries declared some form of environmental emphasis related to the SDGs. Among these, the most frequently prioritised SDGs (each by 15 countries) are SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 14 (life below water). The reflects the common need for an urgent response to climate change. The UN’s in July 2017 was identified as a key driver for countries’ self-reflection and assessment on progress towards the protection of marine environment, which is the main objective of SDG 14, the third most prioritised SDG with an environmental dimension. SDG 15 (life on land) is also frequently prioritised, with 14 Eionet countries expressing a focus or emphasis on this SDG in their VNRs, indicating While some countries have chosen to prioritise certain SDGs with an environmental dimension, . However, as stipulated in the UNSDSN’s ‘Getting Started with the SDGs’ guide , . Instead, prioritisation means identifying the areas lagging furthest behind to catalyse resources, awareness, and policy actions to spur rapid progress and to use those areas as entry points to the broader sustainability transformation. Based on countries’ VNR reporting, for each SDG there is a range of environmental action across countries. A review of the areas in which Eionet countries are focusing domestic environmental action (Figure 1) shows that at least 90 % of Eionet countries have some form of focused action related to (water and sanitation), (affordable and clean energy), (sustainable cities and communities), (climate action) and (life on land). Where there are , this may reflect national contexts and policy priorities. For example, countries which do not have environmental actions focused on (life below water) include those that are landlocked (e.g. Austria, Liechtenstein and Slovakia). Approximately 30 % of Eionet countries do not have environmental actions related to (good health and wellbeing) and (industry, innovation and infrastructure). This may indicate that many countries consider these SDGs to be only indirectly related to environmental action. However, focusing efforts in similar areas. For example, on (affordable and clean energy), 30 countries reported action related to energy efficiency, and for (life on land), 34 countries reported action related to the preservation of biodiversity or halting its loss. in actions by countries: for example, (water and sanitation), where the most common focus of action is on wastewater management (13 countries) but a wide range of other actions, such as those related to drinking water quality, water efficiency and managing groundwater reserves, are reported by between 5 and 10 countries. Where there is a across countries, this is likely to reflect the influence of (e.g. geography and climate influencing water availability) and on countries’ choices concerning what to focus on. Some countries also adopt more . For instance, two countries are supporting to help move towards zero hunger ( ), three countries are encouraging the , and one country is establishing to help move towards sustainable consumption and production ( ). In addition, currently, (for reporting to the UN on SDGs) in [ ] are their , whereas in , the responsibility of acting as the national focal point is . In countries which have assigned their Ministries of Environment as the national focal points to the UN’s 2030 Agenda, the significance of the environmental dimension of the SDGs could be considered more prominent.

All official European Union website addresses are in the domain. Briefing The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) has produced a global SDG Index since 2016, and in 2019, published two flagship reports assessing global and country progress in implementing the SDGs. The first report [ ], published in , considered progress in all UN member states, while the second report [ ], published in , focused on progress in EU Member States. The 2019 Europe Sustainable Development Report is the first independent quantitative report on the progress of the EU and its Member States towards the SDGs. Each report includes quantitative SDG indices showing countries’ progress against SDG indicators and indicating that European countries are leading globally in the progress towards achieving the SDGs (SDSN, 2019). Most recently, the European Sustainable Development Network´s (ESDN) Quarterly Report ‘The Implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs at the National Level in Europe – Taking stock of governance mechanisms’ [ ], published in December 2019, provides an overview of the state of implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs at the national level in Europe by surveying ESDN national focal points in around 30 European countries (ESDN, 2020). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report ‘Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand’ also provides country-level information on SDGs. The report compares countries’ relative compliance with the SDGs in OECD countries, 27 of which are EEA members. However, it has a strong data focus, like the Eurostat-led EU SDG monitoring report, which is not the focus of this report. At the EU level, the European Commission (EC) published a on European action for sustainability on 22 November 2016. As part of this package, the EC presented a mapping of the existing European actions with the SDGs and stated that all 17 SDGs were being addressed through European action. However, it added that stronger implementation and further focused action in all areas would be required to implement the full Agenda by 2030 (EC, 2016). In Europe, 2019 marked an important year for tracking country-level SDG progress. In order to catalyse further action to implement the SDGs in Europe, the EC published a non-legislative initiative in the form of a reflection paper, , on 30 January 2019 (EC, 2019). The Reflection Paper is part of the debate on the future of Europe which was launched through the Commission’s on 1 March 2017 (EC, 2017). In February 2019, the European Parliament’s study on ‘Europe’s approach to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals: Good practices and the way forward’ was published. Its purpose was to capture the two-level character of SDG implementation at the EU and Member State level, to contribute to a joint voluntary EU report at the HLPF 2019, and to examine governance frameworks in place for the implementation of SDGs in EU Member States through 28 country fact sheets. As the first comprehensive comparative overview of SDG governance in the EU, it also provides an overview of the activities and policy developments at the EU level (EP, 2019). In April 2019, the EC published the second Environment Implementation Review (EIR) [ ], an overview of how EU environmental policies and laws are applied on the ground. It comprises a communication with policy findings and an annex with the priority actions for the EU Member States, a policy background document as well as 28 country reports. The report emphasises that sustainable development links environmental, social and economic policies in a coherent framework and acknowledges that it helps to implement environmental legislation and policies. The second EIR dedicates a section to sustainable development and implementation of the UN SDGs at the end of each country report (EC, 2019). The European Semester Autumn Package, adopted in December 2019, includes an ‘Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy’ that reflects the Commission's focus on a sustainable and inclusive economic model. This new economic agenda reflects the ambition of the European Green Deal and rests on four dimensions: environmental sustainability, productivity gains, fairness, and macroeconomic stability. Published in February 2020, the present a thorough analysis of the key socio-economic challenges of macro-economic relevance facing each Member State. The 2020 country reports feature a reinforced analysis and monitoring of the SDGs, including the contribution of macro-economic policies to their delivery. The European Semester 2020 Country Reports feature a section on SDGs and an annex with the EU SDG indicators. These reports emphasise the challenges and opportunities for our economies arising from the green transition. Each country report now includes a summary assessment of Member State progress towards achieving the SDGs as well as a dedicated annex setting out individual Member State’s SDG performance and the trend over the past five years, both based on the set of EU SDG indicators developed by Eurostat. From a sustainability perspective, it is promising to see that SDG knowledge in support of informed policymaking is continuing to expand, particularly in Europe. Similarly, the SOER 2020 stressed that this comprehensive set of sustainability goals and its targets are expected to be increasingly integrated throughout future EU policy frameworks. For an integrated knowledge base on SDG progress, it is also important to apply a combination of qualitative and quantitative SDG assessment approaches [ ]. Against the backdrop of these recent EU-wide developments, this EEA publication stands out through its . The objective of this analysis is to equip its readers with up-to-date cross-country analysis as well as individual country profiles which give insight into the focus and prioritisation of environmental action across Europe, as well as country-by-country insights. It shows both the convergences and divergences towards environmental sustainability in Europe. The converging environmental focus points to the overall environmental challenges that persist in Europe, whereas diversification indicates emerging challenges or different geographical needs and political priorities in countries. Innovative approaches and good practices in the country profiles reflected here may also be inspirational. Secondly, the of this publication includes 33 EEA member countries [ ] and 6 cooperating countries [ ]. It is useful for non-EU countries to compare their SDG processes against those of EU Member States as well for the EC to gain insights into environmental actions across Europe. Since 2016, the European Environment Agency (EEA) has performed several mapping activities in relation to the SDGs — for example, the preliminary mapping of the SDGs and global SDG indicators across EEA reports, indicators and data flows (2016). More recently, in support of the SOER 2020 integrated assessment, the EEA partnered with the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) to build on their methodology and illustrate the importance of considering SDG interactions — i.e. synergies and trade-offs occurring when pursuing the SDG framework as a whole, in a publication entitled ‘SDGs and the environment in the EU: A systems view to improve coherence’ [ ]. This approach is also developed, although with a different focus, by the , the UN, the OECD and key research organisations (e.g. ). : , p. 15, 2019. By complementing the EEA’s contribution to the EU SDG monitoring report and the abovementioned report on SDG interactions, this web publication aims to support the knowledge base on SDGs, particularly in light of the EC’s new priorities and the Green New Deal for Europe. In this context, this publication is based on a three-year mapping and analysis of [ ] environmental SDG actions and processes by EEA member and cooperating countries. It was informed by publications on Europe’s SDG actions, a wider NFP/Eionet consultation conducted between February and April 2020, and the UN Voluntary National Reviews published between 2016-2020. This publication covers country profiles and an accompanying cross-country analysis. The profiles sum up the ways in which countries prioritise or identify the focus of action for those SDGs with an environmental dimension. in accordance with the approach taken in SOER 2020 (EEA, 2019) (Figure 2). Based on this, the Agency identified 11 SDGs with both direct and indirect environmental dimensions (SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15). These SDGs relate to 7 Environment Action Programme (7EAP) objectives as follows: However, it is important to mention that SDG 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships) are also very important in achieving effective environmental governance and finance. : EEA compilation based on SOER 2020 (SOER 2020, p.58, 2019). The EEA report SOER 2020 [ ] also highlights that some SDGs embed a strong environmental dimension, particularly SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 14 on conservation of marine ecosystems, and SDG 15 on the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and the sustainable use of their resources. Environmental sustainability is also sought in relation to agriculture (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), infrastructure and industry (SDG 9), tourism (SDG 8), cities (SDG 11), and consumption and production patterns (SDG 12). In addition to their environmental lens, the country profiles give brief accounts of national plans, strategies and initiatives, governance, and processes as well as stakeholder engagement specifically set up for SDG actions. The information provided for this purpose was gathered mainly from the UN Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) [ ] submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development between 2016-2020. Acknowledging that VNRs have their own limitations and not all countries have available or recently published VNRs, the EEA also gathered information from other sources listed below, which explore the SDG actions and environmental focus of these 39 countries: To give an overall picture on SDG actions across Europe, the country profiles are accompanied by a cross-country analysis on SDGs in Europe. The EEA cross-country analysis gives an insight on how countries deal with the environmental dimensions of various SDGs. For the environmental analysis, (Figure 2). For example, in terms of food systems, some countries focused on agriculture whereas others focused on food labelling and food waste. The cross-country analysis also gives a snapshot of Europe as regards delivering Agenda 2030 from an environmental lens.

Briefing This narrative is part of a series called ‘ ’ published by the EEA’ Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a year of involuntary as well as voluntary change. While there is still no consensus on how the infectious agent SARS-CoV-2 emerged, the study by Cheng et al. (2007) has been put forward as an example of an early warning. They wrote: Coronaviruses are well known to undergo genetic recombination, which may lead to new genotypes and outbreaks. The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. The possibility of the re-emergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored (Cheng et al., 2007, p.683). Human progress depends on the ability and willingness to learn from the past. The way early warnings of environmental and human hazards emerge, and how they are dealt with, provides us with many ‘late’ lessons (EEA, 2001, 2013). These lessons can help pave the way towards more resilient and better-prepared societies. Previous EEA reports describe cases of unintended environmental hazards caused by the use of chemicals or other activities (EEA, 2001, 2013). These late lessons mainly highlight the need for precautionary approaches and how to strike a balance between desired economic opportunities and uncertain environmental harm. Plagues and pandemics have occurred throughout human history (Waltner-Toews, 2020). However, today’s globalised societies and economies, and the way we interact with the natural environment, affect the way pandemics develop. There is little doubt that new pathogens are often created at the interfaces between wild and domestic animals and humans, and that these sometimes manifest as zoonotic disease (Figure 1). According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2020), ‘60 per cent of known infectious diseases in humans and 75 per cent of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic’, while at least six outbreaks of novel coronaviruses were observed in the last century. Several interacting drivers underpin the emergence of zoonotic diseases by creating novel and diverse contacts among wildlife, livestock and people. These include (1) population growth and rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation, (2) increasing demand for animal protein, with a consequent increase in exploitation of wildlife, agricultural intensification and trade, (3) inadequate husbandry practices and (4) poorly managed informal wildlife and fresh produce markets, and industrial meat processing plants (UNEP, 2020). It is also clear that today’s high levels of international trade and travel make pathogens spread faster, as ‘diseases can now move around the world in periods shorter than their incubation periods’ (UNEP, 2020). : EEA (2020a), adapted from Jones et al. (2013) More attention is also being paid to these complexities in policy fields outside epidemiology and public health, as health crises like COVID-19 have far-reaching implications for people and society at large. The Council of Europe recently addressed the relationship between pandemics and democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law. It reminds us that the COVID-19 crisis should not be used as a pretext for restricting the public’s access to information, and that emergency measures taken by Member States should not undermine EU’s founding values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Council of Europe, 2020). One positive thing that we’ve learned from COVID-19 is that contemporary societies are in fact able to ‘act with necessary force’ when required (Mahmood and Sanchez, 2020). New regulations can be quickly enforced, with certain social practices and economic activities even being prohibited. Airports, restaurants, sports arenas and schools can be closed overnight if the reason is considered legitimate (at least when it is seen as temporary). EU Member States have willingly taken measures against COVID-19 that have had enormous economic costs, along with creating the risk of economic recession and severe unemployment. The global community will need years, if not decades, to assess the full extent of COVID-19 and its implications for our society, including its impacts on inequalities, health and the well-being of citizens (EEA, 2020b). Unprecedented national lockdowns, travel restrictions and the closing of national borders in the first half of 2020 and since have led to short-term improvements in the environment in Europe. Reductions in traffic, shipping and aviation led to sudden improvements in air quality and noise levels, with the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO ) in some cities declining by up to 60% compared with the same period in 2019 (EEA, 2020c). The pandemic also had the immediate effect of encouraging people to choose more active modes of travel. The increase in cycling in particular has prompted cities to become more bike friendly, including by introducing new cycling infrastructure (Kraus and Koch, 2021; Nikitas et al., 2021). A reduction in human activity gave habitats the chance to recover and species the opportunity to occupy new spaces and niches (EEA, 2020d). Moreover, preliminary data show that EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decreased by 10% from 2019 to 2020 (EEA, 2021a). As a society, we should learn from past experiences. The 2008-2009 financial crisis led to lower emissions, but the effect was short-lived (Peters et al., 2012). Now, once again, the imperative to emerge from economic recession and the apparent resilience of unsustainable political and economic priorities provide little hope that the post-corona planet will be more sustainable, unless there is an active and conscious change in social and economic practices. : EEA (2021c) During the pandemic, we have struggled with and learned to cope with the crisis. For a time, we changed our daily actions and reoriented our priorities, valued things differently and perhaps appreciated the natural world around us more. Yet, the question remains as to whether we have changed in any fundamental way. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the systemic frailty of our global economy and society (EEA, 2020e). It is not going too far to say that we are currently living in a world characterised by multiple global crises: a health crisis, an economic and financial crisis, a climate crisis and a crisis in nature (EEA, 2020e). One thing that the history of pandemics has taught us is that more pandemics should be expected (Waltner-Toews, 2020) and we should at the very least be prepared. ‘COVID-19 is not only a wake-up call, it is a dress rehearsal for the world of challenges to come […] The pandemic has taught us that our choices matter. As we look to the future, let us make sure we choose wisely.’ A. Guterres (2020), Secretary-General of the United Nations Taking the early warning from Cheng et al. (2007) seriously would mean considering a range of measures globally, including tackling illegal wildlife trade, closing down illegal food markets, tightening the regulation of industrial meat production, changing social and cultural food practices and, ultimately, changing unsustainable patterns of consumption, urbanisation and natural habitat destruction (IPBES, 2020). As highlighted by the OECD (2021), returning to business as usual would mean missing a vital opportunity to tackle underlying and interconnected environmental, economic, social and relational challenges that pre-date COVID-19. A well-being approach could guide the process of ‘building back better’ (OECD, 2021), especially if underpinned by the realisation that environmental health is a prerequisite for public health. We do not lack knowledge or ideas for action. The limiting factor is agency, the agency to address the driving forces underpinning this and other global crises. The next crisis, whatever form it takes, is likely to reveal itself for what it is: yet another symptom of the same underlying problem — unsustainable human production and consumption (EEA, 2020e). It is this chronic problem that continues to express itself in challenges that are framed either as ‘issues’ — to be addressed in premeditated policy cycles — or as ‘crises’ — requiring extraordinary and emergency measures (Lakoff, 2017). Therefore, our societies’ governance approaches should address not only the underlying roots of the problems themselves, but also the increasingly frequent or even simultaneous emergence of what we used to think of as exceptional crises. To address the sustainability problem we face, social and economic practices must change across different levels and aspects of society: the way we live our lives and the way we eat, move and power our societies cannot remain the same. While enduring COVID-19 lockdowns, French anthropologist and philosopher Bruno Latour proposed an exercise of reflection (Latour, 2020). He suggested that we consider which suspended activities we would like to see gone for good and which we would like to resume; which brand-new activities or habits we would like to develop in the aftermath of the pandemic; and how workers or entrepreneurs disenfranchised by a reshaped economy might be helped to transition into other, more sustainable or more resilient roles or activities. While this exercise can be performed individually, it also gives rise to fundamental questions that deserve attention at institution level. Given the wide recognition that sustainability transitions depend on certain practices being phased out (EEA, 2019), the exercise could even serve as inspiration for the further development and implementation of the European Green Deal. COVID-19 triggered sudden and forceful action. Emergencies have their own dynamics and risks, not least to democracy and legality. Yet, we have seen that, where there’s a will, there’s a way. Reflecting on the unprecedented mobilisation and impact of responses to COVID-19 can inspire new ways of thinking and help humanity to seize the moment and make a change. If we can temporarily shut down parts of society to survive the threat of COVID-19, it seems entirely reasonable that we can make significant societal changes to prevent COVID-22, -25 or -30, not to mention the other threats due to climate change and environmental degradation that we will most likely face.

        "meta_description": "A story of three possible warmer worlds. The future will look different no matter what - just how different is our choice.",
        "content": "This infographic is based on the Cross Chapter Box 8 of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C that was completed in 2018. It illustrates three storylines of these possible warmer worlds based on different mitigation options as outlined in Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 2 located in , which draws knowledge across chapters such as mitigation scenarios, Chapter 3’s assessments of changes in regional climate and accounting for different characteristics of internal climate variability in the next decade, and other elements from Chapters and of the report. All three storylines illustrate how differing actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change, as well as how the Earth’s internal climate variability, can result in very different future warmer worlds. The three different storylines show: a path among a where there is a collective, early move to mitigation; an where delayed action occurs only after a warm decade in the 2020s; and a where there is uncoordinated action that occurs only late in 21st century. In the intermediate and worst-case storylines, internal climate variability plays a role in determining climate action (realisation vs overlooking of urgency). (definitions are adapted from the SR15, SROCC and SRCCL Glossaries) Mitigation refers to human intervention to reduce emissions or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases. A mitigation scenario is a plausible description of the future that describes how the (studied) system responds to the implementation of mitigation policies and measures. A mitigation pathway is a temporal evolution of a set of mitigation scenario features, such as greenhouse gas emissions and socio-economic development. Climate variability refers to deviations of climate variables from a given mean state (including the occurrence of extremes, etc.) at all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be intrinsic, due to fluctuations of processes internal to the climate system (internal variability), or extrinsic, due to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (forced variability). Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels. Estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2°C (likely between 0.1°C and 0.3°C) per decade due to past and ongoing emissions. Superimposed internal climate variability can modulate decadal temperature variations and other climate characteristics at the global and regional scales. These three storylines explore contrasted characteristics of internal variability in the next decade (2020s). The orange world’s very warm conditions in the 2020s is the result of a scenario that follows higher transient warming in that decade as a result of internal climate variability, in addition to human-induced trends. In contrast, the red world portrays a scenario in which the mean warming in the 2020s is slightly lower than that expected from human-induced trends due to natural climate variability. In both scenarios, internal variability is back to normal after 2030. Removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by deliberate human activities, i.e., in addition to the removal that would occur via natural carbon cycle processes. Ecological processes or functions having monetary or non-monetary value to individuals or society at large. These are frequently classified as (1) supporting services such as productivity or biodiversity maintenance, (2) provisioning services such as food or fibre, (3) regulating services such as climate regulation or carbon sequestration, and (4) cultural services such as tourism or spiritual and aesthetic appreciation. Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. Pathways that exceed the stabilization level (concentration, forcing, or temperature) before the end of a time horizon of interest (e.g., before 2100) and then decline towards that level by that time. Once the target level is exceeded, removal by sinks of greenhouse gases is required."
