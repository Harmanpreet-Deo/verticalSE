        "meta_description": "Climate litigation represents a frontier solution to change the dynamics of the fight against climate change. This Global Climate Litigation Report: 2023 Status Review shows that people are increasingly turning to the courts to combat the climate crisis. As of December 2022, there have been 2,180 climate-related cases filed in 65 jurisdictions, including international and regional courts, tribunals, quasi-judicial bodies, or other adjudicatory bodies, such as Special Procedures at the United Nations and arbitration tribunals. This represents a steady increase from 884 cases in 2017 and 1,550 cases in 2020. Children and youth, women\u2019s groups, local communities, and Indigenous Peoples, among others, are taking a prominent role in bringing these cases and driving climate change governance reform in more and more countries around the world. This report, which updates previous United Nations Environment Programme reports published in 2017 and 2020, provides an overview of the current state of climate change litigation and an update on global climate change litigation trends. It provides judges, lawyers, advocates, policymakers, researchers, environmental defenders, climate activists, human rights activists (including women\u2019s rights activists), NGOs, businesses and the international community at large with an essential resource to understand the current state of global climate litigation, including descriptions of the key issues that courts have faced in the course of climate change cases. This report further demonstrates the importance of an environmental rule of law in combating the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Access to justice enables the protection of environmental law and human rights and promotes accountability in public institutions. The report was launched in conjunction with the anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly\u2019s recognition of the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment (A/RES/76/300), as the majority of cases brought before the courts demonstrate concrete links between human rights and climate change. The UNGA resolution, which recognises that climate change impacts have negative implications on the enjoyment of all human rights, is likely to drive further action on climate change in the future.

This pivotal event will focus on establishing new finance targets, advancing adaptation measures, and strengthening the loss and damage fund. In anticipation of next year\u2019s updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), COP29 is expected to drive greater ambition in climate commitments. This conference could mark a crucial turning point, scaling up climate finance and transforming the UAE consensus pledges into concrete actions.\u00a0 With three COPs scheduled in 2024, this year presents an opportunity to advance integrated approaches for achieving the goals of the Rio Conventions. By aligning national plans\u2014such as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), and Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) targets\u2014nations can foster co-benefits and enhance synergistic impacts.\u00a0 Building on momentum from the World Urban Forum, UNEP will emphasize the crucial role of sub-national leadership in driving ambitious climate action.

Transboundary climate risks include food and water shortages, threats to trade and energy supplies, widening inequalities, forced migrations and geopolitical conflicts.At last year\u2019s UN Climate Change Conference, Parties recognised that climate change impacts are often transboundary and involve complex, cascading risks that require knowledge-sharing and international cooperation. This event, hosted by UNEP, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) in collaboration with Overseas Development Institute (ODI), discusses what this means in practice, the materiality of these risks and how we can build resilience in vulnerable regions affected by this global challenge.Event Objectives:Raise awareness of transboundary climate impacts and risks with global, regional and national adaptation policymakers;Showcase successful examples of regional cooperation to manage transboundary climate risks;Identify recommendations and entry points for the integration of transboundary climate risks into relevant policy processes (e.g., Global Goal on Adaptation and National Adaptation Plans);Foster the creation of partnerships to advance regional cooperation around transboundary climate risks.\u00a0For more information, contact anna.kilponen@un.org",

        "meta_description": "In 2012, the Government of Tanzania secured funding from the Adaptation Fund and the Global Environment Facility\u2019s Least Developed Country Fund to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities in coastal areas. The country is facing the impacts of climate change on the coasts through rain-induced flooding and sea-level rise. A major approach of the projects was to build the resilience of coastal communities by restoring and building concrete infrastructure, such as seawalls and urban drainage systems, which are expected to withstand climate change and protect communities and assets. To complement the grey infrastructure, the projects restored mangrove and coral habitats, both of which act as natural barriers and buffers against wave surges. The use of nature-based solutions for adapting to climate change is known as ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). Both projects have reduced climate vulnerability in critical coastal areas, assisted the country to implement its National Action Programme for Adaptation (NAPA), restored key ecosystems, and are estimated to have directly benefitted a total of at least 58,000 people, in addition to the economic benefits to the local economies in the coastal areas covered in the project. In all components of the project, key lessons were learned for best practices for monitoring and evaluation, sustainability and upscaling, EbA implementation and project design.",

        "meta_description": "In the UNEP strategy for Environmental Education and Training, the environment is understood to encompass the natural and built environment, socioecological and economic aspects of environmental issues, and the political dimension of environmental protection. In this context, environmental education and training include aspects related to a wide variety of environmental and development issues that affect and are affected by human activities and natural phenomena.Recognising that the capacity of human society to address environment and development issues and risks differs according to context, culture, skills and patterns of environmental change, this strategy recognises the need for appropriate education and training, skills, technology, infrastructure, access to resources and information for enhanced environmental management capabilities. As such UNEP recognises education as the primary agent for social change towards sustainable development and as a vital tool for the achievement of UNEP's mandate.UNEP's vision for Environmental Education & Training for Sustainable Development (EETSD) in the next decade is to support a holistic approach to protecting the environment and improving people's quality of life by developing and strengthening initiatives that are responsive, locally relevant, and aimed at transforming people's visions and aspirations into reality for present and future generations.This strategy also considers environmental education as continuous lifelong learning that emphasises the complexity of environmental issues and calls for the use of different and innovative educational approaches to teaching and learning. The strategy is also consistent with the environmental education principles which recognise environmental education as a continuous and lifelong process, based on interdisciplinary approaches, active participation and individual and group responsibility for the environment. Working towards sustainable development is the responsibility of every citizen. This makes environmental education important for everyone. Recognising this diversity, education in this strategy includes the different educational sectors, namely formal, non-formal and informal. In this context, education includes public awareness and training as away of including all citizens in the efforts to assess and address their environmental and developmental problems. This also enables the empowerment of young and old people to enhance greater public participation in decision-making processes.For more information on the UNEP strategy, please contact:Environmental Education and Training UnitEcosystems DivisionUN Environment ProgrammeP.O.

        "meta_description": "Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation Forests are an available, effective and cost-efficient key nature-based solution that can provide up to a third of the mitigation required to keep global warming well below 2\u00b0C. Forests have a mitigation potential of over 5 GtCO2e per year by halting forest loss and degradation, and sustainable forest management, conservation and restoration (REDD+). REDD+ is a climate change mitigation solution developed by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Its framework, the so-called Warsaw Framework was adopted in 2013 at COP 19 in Warsaw and provides the methodological and financing guidance for the implementation of REDD+ activities. The Paris Climate Agreement recognizes REDD+ and the central role of forests in Article 5. REDD+ reduces deforestation through the conservation and sustainable management of forests and supporting developing countries in turning their political commitments, as represented in their Nationally Determined Contributions, into action on the ground. Forests mitigate climate change because of their capacity to remove carbon from the atmosphere and to store it in biomass and soils. When forests are cleared or degraded, they can become a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by releasing that stored carbon. It is estimated that globally, deforestation and forest degradation account for around 11 percent of CO2 emissions. To date, 118 countries have included forest and land use in their Nationally Determined Contributions pledges. This represents 162 million hectares of restored, reforested and afforested land, which is in line with the Bonn Challenge and the New York Declaration on Forests. Since 2008 the UN-REDD Programme (UNEP, FAO and UNDP) has been supporting 65 partner countries in their nationally led efforts to become \u201cREDD+ ready\u201d and qualify for results-based payments. As of today, UN-REDD countries have submitted forest emissions reductions equal to taking 150 million cars off the road for a year. And UN-REDD has channeled and mobilized more than USD 1 billion since inception. Within the UN-REDD Programme, UNEP leads on private sector engagement, safeguards, knowledge management and communications. Key facts\u00a0 During 2015\u20132020, the rate of deforestation was estimated at 10 million hectares per year. Currently 11% of all carbon emissions stem from deforestation \u2013 more than emissions from all means of transport combined. Limiting climate change to well below 2C cannot be achieved without REDD+. Halting deforestation and forest degradation can avoid emissions of more than 5 gigatons CO2e/year. Forest conservation and restoration can provide more than one quarter of the emissions reductions needed in the next two decades. The goals of the Paris Agreement cannot be met without the world's forests: their mitigation potential by 2030 is about 5 gigatons/year, on par with that of industry and only behind the energy sector. Forests, however, are more than that. Protecting the world's forests is crucial to meet the Sustainable Development Goals: they provide an array of critically important ecosystem services including habitat for biodiversity of global significance and livelihoods for vulnerable and indigenous communities. Forests and woodlands are important stores of planet-warming carbon dioxide, soaking up 30 per cent of emissions from industry and fossil fuels. But every year, the world loses 10 million hectares of forests, an area larger than Portugal. Deforestation and forest degradation account for approximately 11 percent of carbon emissions. If deforestation were a country, it would rank third in carbon dioxide emissions behind China and the United States of America. An annual outlay of $1 million in forest management can generate from 500 to 1,000 jobs in many developing countries, and 20 to 100 in most developed and middle-income countries. Investments in forests can become a backbone for COVID-19 recovery efforts in rural economies in developing countries. For more information visit UN-REDD or learn more about UNEP's work on forests.",

        "meta_description": "The United Nations Core Values\u2014integrity, professionalism and respect for diversity\u2014are shared principles and beliefs that underpin the work of UNEP and guide the actions and behaviour of personnel.\u00a0 UNEP personnel are required to\u00a0\u00a0 Become acquainted and comply with the relevant policies, rules and regulations,\u00a0 Demonstrate zero tolerance for prohibited conduct by themselves and others,\u00a0\u00a0 Raise awareness and take action if they witness prohibited conduct, for example, by reporting prohibited conduct, and\u00a0 Undertake relevant mandatory and non-mandatory training.\u00a0 Prohibited conduct Prohibited conduct refers to a staff member\u2019s failure to comply with United Nations regulations, rules and internal policies.\u00a0 The following United Nations rules, regulations and administrative issuances address prohibited conduct: ST/SGB/2018/1/REV.1 \u2013 Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2002/13 \u2013 Status, Basic Rights and Duties of United Nations Staff Members ST/AI/2017/1 \u2013 Unsatisfactory conduct, investigation and the disciplinary process ST/SGB/2018/1 \u2013 Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2019/8 \u2013 Addressing discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment and abuse of authority Acts that constitute prohibited conduct include, but are not limited, to the following: Sexual harassment, Sexual exploitation and abuse Harassment: Harassment is any unwelcome conduct that might reasonably be expected or perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another person when such conduct interferes with work or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions intended to annoy, alarm, abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another. Discrimination: Discrimination is any unfair treatment or arbitrary distinction based on a person\u2019s race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, disability, age, language, social origin or other similar shared characteristic or trait. Fraud and corruption: Fraud encompasses any act or omission whereby an individual or entity knowingly misrepresents or conceals a material fact in order to obtain an undue benefit or advantage for himself, herself, itself or a third party, or to cause another to act to his or her detriment. Corruption refers to any act or omission that misuses official authority or seeks to influence the misuse of official authority in order to obtain an undue benefit for oneself or a third party. Fraudulent acts are any intentional misconduct that misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party to obtain a financial benefit or other benefit or to avoid an obligation and seek to evade detection. Abuse of authority: Abuse of authority is the improper use of a position of influence, power or authority against another person. This is particularly serious when a person uses their influence, power or authority to improperly influence the career or employment conditions of another, including, but not limited to, appointment, assignment, contract renewal, performance evaluation, working conditions or promotion. Other prohibited conduct includes unauthorised outside activities, misrepresentation, forgery, false certification or failure to disclose a material fact in connection with United Nations\u00a0claims and benefits, acts or omissions in conflict with the general obligations of a staff member, misuse of United Nationsvproperty, medical and dental fraud, and misuse of office, including breach of confidentiality and abuse of privileges and immunities. Reporting prohibited conduct Information about possible prohibited conduct may be brought to the attention of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) Investigation hotline or the Executive Director of UNEP (with a copy to OIOS). A formal report should be detailed enough to allow for a review of the report. All anonymous reports should be filed with OIOS. All reports of possible prohibited conduct are reviewed through a preliminary assessment to decide on the need for an investigation. OIOS, or UNEP, investigates reports of possible prohibited conduct through fact-finding panels, which are set up to make findings of fact that will help others determine whether prohibited conduct took place. A disciplinary process is conducted, following which disciplinary measures are implemented. Procedure for addressing prohibited conduct 1. Receipt of the complaint by UNEP or OIOS The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), through its Investigations Division (OIOS/ID), retains the ultimate authority to review all complaints about unsatisfactory conduct. In view of this, UNEP is required to transfer all complaints received to OIOS/ID. OIOS/ID must then decide whether to review \u00a0and investigate the complaint or refer it to UNEP for appropriate action \u2013 such as conducting a preliminary assessment, taking interim administrative and managerial actions, and requesting assistance from the Ombudsman\u2019s office to conduct mediation or coaching. There is no timeline for this phase of the process. 2. Preliminary assessment and investigation by UNEP Upon receipt of a referral from OIOS/ID, UNEP conducts a preliminary assessment. The purpose of the preliminary assessment is to determine whether an investigation should be initiated. A preliminary assessment is not a formal investigation process and does not require investigators. \u00a0It is primarily carried out by the Corporate Services Division/Legal Section or Corporate Services Division/Human Resources Section of UNEP, under the supervision of the UNEP Executive Director. Following the preliminary assessment, Corporate Services Division recommends actions to be taken, whether case \u00a0closure, administrative or managerial actions, or the initiation of an investigation. \u00a0The Executive Director makes the decision to initiate an investigation, based on a recommendation from the Corporate Services Division. The timeline to conduct a preliminary assessment is three months. 3. Investigation If a decision is made to investigate a report of possible unsatisfactory conduct, the Executive Director \u00a0will appoint a fact-finding panel. \u00a0The fact-finding panel comprises OIOS/ID-trained United Nations staff members, \u00a0staff members with prior investigation experience, or retired staff members who have conducted workplace investigations and have received OIOS/ID training. Under\u00a0 ST/SGB/2019/8 - Addressing discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment and abuse of authority,\u00a0the Executive Director is required to appoint OIOS/ID-trained investigators to a fact-finding panel for complaints of harassment, abuse of authority, or discrimination. Other reports of unsatisfactory conduct listed in ST/AI/2017/1-Unsatisfactory conduct, investigation and the disciplinary process can be handled by trained investigators and/or current or retired United Nations staff members with prior investigation experience. Investigations conducted by fact-finding panels appointed by the Executive Director should comply with the\u00a0Investigators' Toolkit. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance (DMSPC) maintains a roster of investigators who have been trained by OIOS/ID across the United Nations. Investigators on the roster can serve as investigators for any United Nations entity in need of one. \u00a0The UNEP roster currently includes 13 trained investigators. Investigators are appointed only for the purpose of a fact-finding investigation, either by OIOS/ID or by the Executive Director. Following an investigation, the fact-finding panel must prepare an investigation report to document the findings. Upon completion of the investigation, the fact-finding panel submits the report to the Executive Director. The Executive Director reviews the investigation report, following an investigation conducted by the fact-finding panel, and decides whether the reported conduct is found to be substantiated, may amount to misconduct and should, therefore, be referred to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources (ASG/OHR) for further review and disciplinary process as necessary. If the conduct is not substantiated by facts, the matter will be closed. The Executive Director will also decide whether to take managerial or administrative action. 4. Timeline \u00a0It takes one month to set up the fact-finding panel after the decision to launch an investigation is reached. \u00a0There is no time limit for the investigation. 5. Disciplinary process Upon referral of the investigation report by OIOS/ID or UNEP, the ASG/OHR reviews to decide whether to initiate a disciplinary process,\u00a0should the facts indicate that the conduct of the alleged offender may amount to misconduct. There is no timeline for the review of the investigation report by the ASG/OHR. If the ASG/OHR initiates a disciplinary process, the alleged offender is provided with formal allegations of misconduct, together with the investigation report and supporting documentation. The alleged offender is entitled to seek legal advice and provide comments. Further investigation by the ASG/OHR may be necessary. \u00a0Upon receipt of formal allegations, the staff member has one month to respond. Upon conclusion of the disciplinary process, the ASG/OHR may (a) Close the case with no action, (b) Refer the case to the Executive Director for managerial or administrative action\u00a0and/or (c) Recommend to the Under-Secretary-General for Management (USG) to (a) Decide that the facts are established to the requisite standard of proof, (b) Impose disciplinary measures if the facts have been established and the behaviour amounts to misconduct, (c) Take administrative or managerial action where necessary, and (d) Decide on recovery of financial loss to the organisation in full or in part. ASG/OHR informs the affected individual of the decision of the USG following the disciplinary process, with a copy to the Executive Director of UNEP. \u00a0 Retaliation/Whistleblowing 1. Protection against retaliation/whistleblowing According to\u00a0ST/SGB/2017/2 REV. 1 - Protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct and for cooperating with duly authorized audits or investigations,\u00a0retaliation is any direct or indirect detrimental action recommended, threatened or taken against an individual who officially reported misconduct or otherwise cooperated with duly authorised audits or investigations. If established, retaliation constitutes misconduct, which is subject to possible sanction. Pursuant to the Secretary-General\u2019s Bulletin (SGB), the United Nations Ethics Office reviews requests for protection. The bulletin encourages individuals to report fraud, corruption and other potential misconduct without the fear of retaliation. Whistleblowers can file reports anonymously to OIOS. The SGB enhances protection for those who report misconduct (any violation of the organisation\u2019s regulations and rules by staff members) or wrongdoing (by any person that would be harmful to the interests, operations or governance of the United Nations), and for those who cooperate with duly authorised audits or investigations. The ability to report misconduct or wrongdoing without fear of retaliation is a critical element to building an organisational culture of integrity, transparency and accountability. A request for protection against retaliation should be submitted to the United Nations Ethics Office within six months of becoming aware of the retaliation. 2. Procedure\u00a0 Requests for protection against retaliation or whistleblower reports should be made by anyone who has reported misconduct or participated in an investigation or audit and believes that he/she/they have been retaliated against. In such a case, the concerned individual(s) should contact the United Nations Ethics Office. The United Nations Ethics Office is responsible for enforcing the anti-retaliation policy, which protects those who report wrongdoing. The United Nations Ethics Office conducts \u201cpreliminary reviews\u201d of retaliation complaints to ascertain whether a prima facie case of retaliation exists. Such a preliminary review is not considered an investigation. However, if the Ethics Office finds a prima facie case of retaliation, it then refers the matter to OIOS. OIOS conducts a full investigation, through setting up a fact-finding panel and gathering facts from different concerned persons. \u00a0At the conclusion of the fact-finding investigation, OIOS transmits the findings to the United Nations Ethics Office for review and action. The United Nations Ethics Office makes the final decision after reviewing the investigation report. Upon its recommendation, the UNEP may be requested to take administrative or managerial actions. The process of addressing protection from retaliation/whistleblowing has been isolated from the concerned\u00a0United Nations entity and will be handled by the UN Ethics Office to ensure impartiality in the review of such complaints. The\u00a0United Nations Ethics Office produces annual reports of its activities to the Secretary-General. Information on the activities of the United Nations Ethics Office, including the number of reports received for \u00a0protection against retaliation, can be viewed online. Fraud and corruption UNEP has adopted a zero-tolerance approach to misconduct \u2013 including fraud and corruption involving its staff members, other\u00a0United Nations personnel or third parties in relation to their work with UNEP. \u201cZero tolerance\u201d means that UNEP will pursue all allegations of fraudulent acts involving any individual or entity covered by UN regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies and procedures. The appropriate administrative/disciplinary measures or contractual remedies will be applied if fraudulent acts are substantiated in accordance with UN procedures concerning prohibited conduct. Furthermore, UNEP may, where deemed appropriate, recover loss suffered by the organisation or refer matters involving credible allegations of criminal fraudulent acts to national authorities. The United Nations has established a dedicated framework on fraud and corruption in ST/IC/2016/25 - Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat (the \u201cFramework\u201d). The Framework promotes a culture of integrity and honesty within the organisation by providing information to staff members on how to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and corruption. UNEP has translated the Framework into the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Guidelines\u00a0(UNEP AFAC Guidelines), which aims to strengthen the organisation\u2019s prevention of and response to incidents of fraud and corruption by providing: Concrete and practical advice to UNEP staff members in identifying potential risk areas; A clear and user-friendly guide and reference for both external and internal audiences for awareness of controls put in place by UNEP, which are aimed at monitoring fraud and corruption; and A consolidated procedure for sanctioning fraud and corruption. On 9 December 2022, United Nations Under-Secretary-General Ms Catherine Pollard launched the Secretariat\u2019s \u201cFraud and Corruption Awareness Handbook.\u201d This helps staff understand how fraud and corruption can manifest in the various processes and functions of the Secretariat. It includes case studies reflecting some of the most common types of fraud and corruption experienced in the organisation, as well as red flags and indicators that may point to the possible presence of fraud and corruption. In addition, it contains references to mechanisms and channels for reporting fraud and corruption, as well as highlights of the process of investigations and imposition of sanctions. The Handbook is available in English and French. How to report fraud and corruption Reporting fraud and corruption follows the same procedure as reporting other prohibited conduct. Confidentiality of the process The process for dealing with prohibited conduct is confidential in order to protect the integrity of the process and the rights of those involved. To the greatest extent possible, the identities of complainants and witnesses are kept confidential and only disclosed to those who have a legitimate reason to know about the process.

        "meta_description": "The Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme, at its twenty-seventh and first universal session held in February 2013, in paragraph 17 of decision 27/2, decided to enhance transparency and openness in its work, and in this regard requested the Executive Director to establish a written access-to-information policy.Subsequently, the Executive Director established the UNEP Access-to-Information Policy on 6 June 2014, which was implemented on an interim basis. Having undertaken a process of its review, the Executive Director establishes the present Policy that supersedes the above-mentioned interim policy.The Executive Director recognizes that in order for UNEP to fully carry out its mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly in its resolution 2997 (XXVII) and other relevant resolutions, it is critically important to disseminate and make accessible the information concerning its work or information generated through its programme, in particular with respect to environmental information as widely as possible. In particular, in the context of Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, it is of fundamental importance for UNEP to make environmental information available to Member States, other stakeholders and the public in general with a view to supporting their efforts in achieving sustainable development.For the purpose of this Policy, \u201cenvironmental information\u201d means any information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material form on:(a) The state of elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites, biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms, and the interaction among these elements;(b) Factors, such as substances, energy, noise and radiation, and activities or measures, including administrative measures, environmental agreements, policies, legislation, plans and programmes, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment within the scope of subparagraph (a) above, and cost-benefit and other economic analyses and assumptions used in environmental decision-making;(c) The state of human health and safety, conditions of human life, cultural sites and built structures, inasmuch as they are or may be affected by the state of the elements of the environment or, through these elements, by the factors, activities or measures referred to in subparagraph (b) above.At the same time, UNEP has an obligation to handle sensitive information in an appropriate manner consistent with the relevant rules and practice of the United Nations. This Policy endeavors to strike an appropriate balance between the need to grant the public maximum access to information in the UNEP\u2019s possession, including environmental information, and UNEP\u2019s obligation to respect the confidentiality of information regarding its Member States, partners, employees and other parties.The Policy will be reviewed and may be updated as necessary by the Executive.\u00a0Such review of the Policy will be undertaken in consultation with Member States and relevant stakeholders.The PolicyUNEP is committed to making information relating to its work, in particular environmental information, available to the public.The Policy is guided by openness. Any information in the custody of UNEP, in particular information concerning the work of UNEP in accordance with its mandate given by the General Assembly in resolution 2997 (XXVII) and other relevant resolutions (such as resolutions 47/190, S-19/2 and 66/288), including environmental information generated and maintained through programmes of UNEP, is available to the public, in the absence of a compelling reason for confidentiality in line with the exceptions to the Policy listed in paragraph 5 below.Information made available to the publicThe information relating to the following functions and responsibilities of the United Nations Environment Assembly of UNEP and the Executive Director stipulated in General Assembly in resolution 2997 (XXVII) will be made available to the public:The United Nations Environment Assembly\u2019s functions and responsibilities:(a) To promote international co-operation in the field of the environment and to recommend, as appropriate, policies to this

of environmental programmes within the United Nations system;(f) To maintain under continuing review the impact of national and international environmental policies and measures on developing countries, as well as the problem of additional costs that may be incurred by developing countries in the implementation of environmental programmes and projects and to ensure that such programmes and projects shall be compatible with the development plans and priorities of those countries;(g) To review and approve the Programme of utilization of resources of the Environment Fund.The Executive Director\u2019s functions and responsibilities:(a) To provide substantive support to the United Nations Environment Assembly;(b) To co-ordinate, under the guidance of the United Nations Environment Assembly, environment programmes within the United Nations systems, to keep their implementation under review and to assess their effectiveness;(c) To advice, as appropriate and under the guidance of the United Nations Environment Assembly, intergovernmental bodies of the United Nations system on the formulation and implementation of environmental programmes;(d) To secure the effective cooperation of, and contribution from, the relevant scientific and other professional communities in all parts of the world;(e) To provide, at the request of all parties concerned, advisory services for the

and handling (ST/SGB/2007/6) which provides, among other things, that information deemed sensitive (requiring such information to be designated confidential and handled as such) includes the following:(a) Documents created by the United Nations, received from or sent to third parties, under an expectation of confidentiality\u00a0which has been expressly stated orally or in writing;(b) Documents whose disclosure is likely to endanger the safety or security of any individual, violates his or her rights, or invades his or her privacy;(c) Documents whose disclosure is likely to endanger the security of Member States or prejudice the security or proper conduct of any operation or activity of the United Nations;(d) Documents covered by legal privilege or related to internal investigations;(e) Internal inter-office or intra-office documents and other communications, including draft documents, if disclosure would undermine the Organization\u2019s free and independent

Information which, if disclosed, in UNEP\u2019 view, would seriously undermine the policy dialogue with Member States or partners concernedRequest for informationInformation that is not available on UNEP public website may be made available upon request. For UNEP\u2019s internal tracking purposes, such requests should quote the following language: \u201cUnder UNEP's Access-to-Information Policy, I am requesting information on....\u201d.\u00a0The request should be directed to:Access-to-Information DeskUnited Nations Environment Programme\u00a0Address: P.O.Box 30552, Nairobi 00100, Kenya\u00a0Phone: +254 20 7621234\u00a0Email: unep-info@un.org\u00a0Regarding request for information that may be considered an exception under this Policy, the officer concerned should seek guidance from Senior Legal Officer on handling of such requests.All information requests should be handled promptly. The requestor should expect to receive an acknowledgement of receipt of the request within five (5) working days. Depending on the complexity of the request, UNEP will endeavour to handle all requests within thirty (30) calendar days after the acknowledgment of receipt is sent. If it is not possible to handle a request within thirty days, UNEP will inform the requestor of the reason why it needs more time and the estimated date for communicating the information concerned.In principle, information should be made available free of charge. For information requests that involve the reproduction of material in hard copies in a large quantity which cannot be delivered within the available resources, UNEP, as required, may charge a limited fee to recover the actual cost of printing of such material and associated labor cost, which will be communicated to the requestor and will need to be paid in advance.If a document contain both confidential information and non-confidential information, and if in UNEP\u2019s view it is consistent with the purpose of paragraph 5 above, part of such document containing only non-confidential information may be made available to the public upon request.UNEP may partially or wholly deny a request for information in accordance with the limitations set out in this Policy, or if the request is deemed an excessive demand upon UNEP\u2019s resources. In case of denying a request for information, UNEP will provide the requestor with a reason for denying such a request.Review and appeal processIf a request of information is denied, the requestor may seek the review of the decision by addressing a letter to the Access-to-Information Panel established pursuant to paragraph 17 below, providing reasons for the appeal.Every request for appeals will be acknowledged. The Panel will review the denial of requests to disclose information concerned or portion of such information to a member of the public.The Executive Director will have the authority to take a final decision concerning the request for information in question.In case of rejecting an appeal, UNEP will provide the requestor with a reason for such rejection.That review should normally be completed within sixty (60) working days of being requested. The outcome of the review will be communicated to the requestorAccess-to-Information PanelThe Access-to-Information Panel is hereby established.The Panel consists of three members, all appointed by the Executive Director: two UNEP staff members and one individual, in his/her personal capacity, from outside of UNEP. Members of the Panel will be selected on the basis of the following criteria: in-depth knowledge and thorough understanding of UNEP policies, structures, programmes and operations at Headquarters, Regional and Sub-regional or Country Office levels; thorough knowledge of, and familiarity with, information disclosure and access to information policies; and proven ability to work with UNEP partners. Members will serve for a term of two years, which may be extended for another term at the discretion of the Executive Director.The Panel\u2019s primary function is to assist the Executive Director to review appeals relating to a request for information and to determine whether the Policy has been properly applied, and to submit its conclusion and relevant recommendations to the Executive Director.In addition, the Panel assists the Executive Director to monitor the implementation of the Policy.The Panel will deliberate with the presence of three members.The Chair of the Panel will be selected from amongst, and by the Panel members.The Panel may develop, as appropriate, more detailed procedures for the review of denied requests, review the implementation of the Policy and provide recommendations on changes which should be made, as well as re-examine the Policy on a regular basis in light of operational and other changes within UNEP.The Panel will meet virtually or in situ whenever there is an appeal for review. The Panel may also meet to consider policy matters related to the Policy and its application, as necessary.Extraordinary circumstancesIn extraordinary circumstances, the Executive Director or such officials as the Executive Director so authorizes may disclose certain information covered in the list of exceptions set out in paragraph 5 above, if the overall benefits of such disclosure outweigh the potential harm to the interests protected by the exceptions. This may include situations in which the disclosure of certain confidential information would be likely to avert imminent and serious harm to public health or safety, or imminent and significant adverse impacts on the environment. Such disclosure by the Executive Director or the authorized official would be on the most restricted basis necessary to achieve the purpose of the disclosure. The disclosure of information received from a Government or a third party in confidence requires the written consent of the Government or the third party concerned.Further ResourcesDownload a PDF version of the Policy",

For example, protecting coastal habitats like mangroves provides natural flood defences; reforestation can hold back desertification and recharge groundwater supplies in times of drought; and water bodies like rivers and lakes provide natural drainage to reduce flooding. These nature-based approaches have a significant potential to boost increase humanity\u2019s climate resilience while simultaneously protecting the natural world. The United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s Global Adaptation Network conducted a stakeholder dialogue process to assess the most crucial barriers to ecosystem-based adaptation and how they can be overcome. This report aims to provide an overview of the main findings and conclusions of this process across three different regions: Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. This report is an output of the Global EbA Fund, which is implemented jointly by UNEP and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The publication was made possible through the generous contribution of the International Climate Initiative (IKI) under the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV).

However, despite growing interest among policymakers, donors, scientists and practitioners, the current pace and scale of EbA implementation falls far short of its potential. The aim of this report is to highlight the opportunities for scaling up the use of EbA to help put the world on a more climate-resilient and nature-positive pathway. The report assesses: The role of EbA in helping society adapt to climate change, while also contributing to biodiversity conservation, climate mitigation and sustainable development Current state and trends in EbA implementation. Barriers that are currently slowing the widespread application of EbA in policy and practice. It also provides a set of recommendations on how to enhance the scale and pace of EbA implementation to more fully harness the potential of ecosystems to deliver adaptation benefits. Based on in-depth analysis and discussions with EbA experts from around the world, the report suggests five broad categories of action that could help overcome many of the current barriers to EbA and ramp up the pace and scale of EbA implementation globally. These recommendations are summarized in the Executive Summary of the report, available in English, French and Spanish.",

        "meta_description": "The World Adaption Science Programme (WASP) has been built from the lessons learned from the previous Programme of Research on Climate Change Vulnerability, Impacts and Adaptation (PROVIA), which was one of the four components that formed the World Climate Programme (WCP) based on the\u00a0WMO Congress XVI Resolution 18. WASP is led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Green Climate Fund (GCF) , the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations University (UNU), and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The WASP has an international panel with a multi-stakeholder governance structure consisting of a Management Group, a Science Committee, and a Policy and Finance Committee. Learn more Vision WASP\u2019s core vision is ensuring that climate adaptation knowledge gaps are filled to inform evidence-based policies, solutions and actions for successful adaptation to new climate conditions. Our priority is addressing the knowledge needs in vulnerable developing countries and providing policy-relevant science for decision-makers. This vision encapsulates three major components: \u00a01. Catalyse bridging current knowledge gaps WASP catalyses research that addresses knowledge needs for adaptation actions and decision-making. Under this category, some actions include identifying knowledge gaps and addressing them through promoting related research; contributing to IPCC WG II, adaptation on the ground, policy through the UNFCCC process, and addressing the needs identified by WASP sponsor organizations. This vision component would be supported by WASP platforms and partnerships that can help catalyse such research. 2. Catalyse bridging potential future knowledge gaps WASP, by engaging with the broad adaptation science community, including the IPCC WG II, identifies key uncertainties and limitations in the underlying scientific areas (social and natural sciences) relevant for adaptation, and work towards addressing them. This would include filling niches/vacuums not addressed by others and taking account of innovative work, emerging trends, and leading-edge thinking. As with paragraph 2.1 above, this vision component would also be supported by WASP platforms and partnerships that can help catalyse such research. 3. Provide policy-relevant guidance through WASP products\u00a0 This includes products authored by WASP members and other experts, that can incorporate evidence-based guidance aiming to fill identified gaps relevant to adaptation planning, implementation, and evaluation, e.g. the WASP science for adaptation policy briefs. Mission WASP\u2019s overall mission is to make science work for climate change adaptation. WASP ensures that researchers, policymakers and practitioners have the knowledge, capacity and solutions to underpin and implement effective adaptation to climate change. Its work focuses primarily on providing products and services to the UNFCCC process, IPCC assessments, GCF projects and GEF projects.

O WASP \u00e9 liderado pelo Programa das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas para o Meio Ambiente (PNUMA), pela Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Meteorol\u00f3gica Mundial (OMM), pela Conven\u00e7\u00e3o-Quadro das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas sobre a Mudan\u00e7a do Clima (UNFCCC), pelo Painel Intergovernamental sobre as Mudan\u00e7as Clim\u00e1ticas (IPCC), pelo Fundo Verde para o Clima (GCF), pelo Fundo Global para o Meio Ambiente (GEF) e pela Universidade das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas (UNU). O WASP disp\u00f5e de um painel internacional com uma estrutura de administra\u00e7\u00e3o multissetorial constitu\u00edda por um grupo de gest\u00e3o, um comit\u00ea cient\u00edfico e um comit\u00ea de pol\u00edtica e finan\u00e7as.\u00a0Saiba mais Vis\u00e3o A vis\u00e3o central do WASP \u00e9 a de um mundo em que as lacunas de conhecimento sobre a adapta\u00e7\u00e3o clim\u00e1tica sejam supridas para os formuladores de pol\u00edticas nos governos, nas empresas e na sociedade civil. H\u00e1 uma \u00eanfase especial no conhecimento cient\u00edfico relevante para as pol\u00edticas, com prioridade \u00e0s necessidades de pesquisa nos pa\u00edses em desenvolvimento vulner\u00e1veis. Essa vis\u00e3o engloba tr\u00eas componentes principais: \u00a01. Catalisar suprindo as lacunas de conhecimento atuais O WASP catalisa pesquisas que abordam as necessidades de conhecimento para as a\u00e7\u00f5es e a tomada de decis\u00f5es de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o. Nesta categoria, algumas a\u00e7\u00f5es incluem: identificar lacunas de conhecimento e supri-las por meio da promo\u00e7\u00e3o de pesquisas relacionadass; contribuir para o GT II do IPCC, as a\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00e1ticas de \u200b\u200badapta\u00e7\u00e3o e as pol\u00edticas por meio do processo da UNFCCC; e responder \u00e0s necessidades identificadas pelas organiza\u00e7\u00f5es patrocinadoras do WASP. Este componente da vis\u00e3o seria apoiado por plataformas e parcerias do WASP que podem ajudar a catalisar essas pesquisas. 2. Catalisar suprindo poss\u00edveis lacunas futuras de conhecimento O WASP, por meio do envolvimento com a comunidade cient\u00edfica da adapta\u00e7\u00e3o em geral, incluindo o GT II do IPCC, identifica as principais incertezas e limita\u00e7\u00f5es nas \u00e1reas cient\u00edficas subjacentes relevantes para a adapta\u00e7\u00e3o (ci\u00eancias sociais e naturais) e trabalha para solucion\u00e1-las. Isso incluiria o preenchimento de nichos/lacunas n\u00e3o abordados por outros, levando em conta o trabalho inovador, as tend\u00eancias emergentes e o pensamento vanguardista. Assim como no par\u00e1grafo 2.1 acima, este componente da vis\u00e3o seria tamb\u00e9m apoiado por plataformas e parcerias do WASP que podem ajudar a catalisar essas pesquisas. 3. Disponibilizar orienta\u00e7\u00f5es relevantes para as pol\u00edticas por meio de produtos do WASP\u00a0 Isso inclui produtos da autoria de membros do WASP e outros peritos que podem incorporar orienta\u00e7\u00f5es baseadas em evid\u00eancias com o objetivo de suprir as lacunas identificadas relevantes para o planejamento, a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o e a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da adapta\u00e7\u00e3o; por exemplo, o uso de dados cient\u00edficos do WASP para produzir resumos de pol\u00edticas de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o. Miss\u00e3o O WASP tem por miss\u00e3o geral fazer com que a ci\u00eancia funcione em benef\u00edcio da adapta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas. O WASP assegura que os pesquisadores, formuladores de pol\u00edticas e profissionais disponham de conhecimentos, capacidade e solu\u00e7\u00f5es para sustentar e implementar uma adapta\u00e7\u00e3o eficaz \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas. Seu trabalho concentra-se essencialmente no fornecimento de produtos e servi\u00e7os para o processo da UNFCCC, as avalia\u00e7\u00f5es do IPCC, os projetos do GCF e os projetos do GEF.

Cette vision englobe trois\u00a0principaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments\u00a0: \u00a01. Catalyser le comblement des lacunes actuelles en mati\u00e8re de connaissances Le WASP catalyse la recherche qui r\u00e9pond aux besoins de connaissances pour les mesures d\u2019adaptation et la prise de d\u00e9cision. Ces mesures comprennent l\u2019identification des lacunes en mati\u00e8re de connaissances et leur r\u00e9solution par la promotion de recherches pertinentes, la contribution au Groupe de travail\u00a0II du GIEC, l\u2019adaptation sur le terrain, l\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques gr\u00e2ce au processus de la CCNUCC, ainsi que la r\u00e9ponse aux besoins recens\u00e9s par les organismes de parrainage du WASP. Cette composante de la vision est appuy\u00e9e par les plateformes et les partenariats du WASP pouvant contribuer \u00e0 catalyser ce type de recherches. 2. Catalyser le comblement des potentielles lacunes en mati\u00e8re de connaissances futures En collaborant avec la vaste communaut\u00e9 scientifique du secteur de l\u2019adaptation, y compris le Groupe de travail\u00a0II du GIEC, le WASP identifie et cherche \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les principales incertitudes et limitations que pr\u00e9sentent les domaines de recherche concern\u00e9s par l\u2019adaptation (sciences naturelles et sociales). Il s\u2019agit notamment de combler les lacunes qu\u2019aucun autre acteur ne traite et de tenir compte des travaux innovants, des tendances \u00e9mergentes et des visions novatrices. Comme pour l\u2019aspect pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, cette composante de la vision sera \u00e9galement appuy\u00e9e par les plateformes et les partenariats du WASP pouvant contribuer \u00e0 catalyser ce type de recherches. 3. Fournir des orientations utiles pour l\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques gr\u00e2ce aux supports du WASP\u00a0 Ces supports, r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par les membres du WASP et par d\u2019autres experts, peuvent int\u00e9grer des orientations fond\u00e9es sur des donn\u00e9es probantes visant \u00e0 combler les lacunes identifi\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re de planification, de mise en \u0153uvre et d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019adaptation. Il s\u2019agit par exemple des notes de synth\u00e8se du WASP sur la science au service de l\u2019adaptation. Mission La mission g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du WASP est de mettre la science au service de l\u2019adaptation aux changements climatiques. Le WASP veille \u00e0 ce que les chercheurs, les d\u00e9cideurs politiques et les professionnels disposent des connaissances, des capacit\u00e9s et des solutions n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9tayer et mettre en \u0153uvre des mesures efficaces d\u2019adaptation aux changements climatiques.

        "meta_description": "Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) is an annual UNEP flagship publication. The report's primary objective is to inform the negotiators of the UNFCCC Member States, and the broader UNFCCC constituency, about the status and trends within climate adaptation at global and regional levels. The AGR also provides a set of science-based options to policymakers and decision-makers to increase ambition in adapting to climate change across key climate-sensitive sectors. Since 2014, UNEP has produced science-based assessments of the adaptation gap with the purpose of facilitating an adequate adaptation response in the context of the temperature and adaptation goals of the UNFCCC process. The adaptation gap is the difference between actually implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to climate change impacts, and reflecting resource limitations and competing priorities. An expert and stakeholder meeting, convened in mid-January 2020, discussed the future framing of the AGR and agreed on a general structure for future AGRs focuses on bringing together multiple sources of information (e.g. scientific literature, international donor project documents, and countries\u2019 reports to the UNFCCC) to move towards an answer to the fundamental question: are we globally on track for successful adaptation commensurate with emissions\u2019 pathways? As well as tracking progress, efforts to answer this question can help to highlight gaps in progress, for example in specific sectors, sections of society, or geographies that will need prioritization and international support to progress towards climate resilience.\u00a0 To date, seven global AGRs and one intermediary update report have been produced: The first report AGR 2014 provided a preliminary approach to assessing adaptation gaps and initial assessments of adaptation gaps in three important areas: finance, technology, and knowledge. An intermediary update report prepared for COP 21 in Paris, France, in 2015.\u00a0 The AGR 2016 provided a more in-depth assessment of the adaptation finance gap and its projected development up to 2050, focusing on global estimates of the costs of adaptation as well as the financing available for adaptation. The AGR 2017, launched in 2017 at COP 23 in Bonn, Germany, focused on a key question arising in the wake of the global goal on adaptation specified in the Paris Agreement: What are the ways forward to assess progress towards this global goal? The AGR 2018, launched during COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, had two parts: Part One examined the gaps that exist in a number of areas central to taking stock and assessing progress on adaptation; Part Two had an in-depth focus on assessing the global adaptation gap in health. The AGR 2020, launched on 14 January\u00a02021, provided the first recurrent assessment of the global status and progress of the adaptation process across three core elements (planning, financing, and implementation). In addition, this year\u2019s report took a thematic deep dive into the status and progress of Nature-Based Solutions in adaptation. The report also provided an initial outlook on overall results in adaptation at the global level taking a forward-looking approach.\u00a0 The AGR 2021, launched on 4 November 2021, found that while policies and planning for climate change adaptation are developing, finance and implementation are still far behind where they need to be. In addition, the report finds that the opportunity to use the fiscal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize green economic growth that also helps nations adapt to climate impacts such as droughts, storms, and wildfire is largely being missed. The AGR 2022, launched on 3 November 2022, found that country adaptation plans, strategies, laws and policies\u00a0are getting better at prioritizing disadvantaged groups (such as Indigenous peoples), however\u00a0financing to turn these plans and strategies into action isn\u2019t following. In addition, the implementation of adaptation actions (concentrated in agriculture, water, ecosystems and cross-cutting sectors)\u00a0is increasing, although without a step change in support, adaptation actions could be outstripped by accelerating climate risks, further widening the adaptation implementation gap. The\u00a0AGR 2023,\u00a0launched\u00a0on 2 November 2023, finds that progress on climate adaptation is slowing when it should be accelerating to catch up with these rising climate change impacts.\u00a0 With the need to adapt to accelerating climate change, the importance of the AGR will grow in the coming years as it will provide updates on progress across key adaptation indicators. To maximize the value-added of the AGR in relation to the post-Paris process, the AGR Steering Committee favors a multi-year planning process. This implies that each subsequent AGR builds on the previous year\u2019s content. Adaptation Research Alliance (ARA) As part of the UK COP 26 Presidency Adaptation & Resilience campaign, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO) is working with partners to develop an international Adaptation Research Alliance for launch at COP 26. This global collaborative effort will seek to catalyze increased investment and capacity for action-orientated research that supports effective adaptation to climate change \u2013 primarily in developing countries \u2013 at the scale and urgency demanded by the science. Following the soft launch at the Gobeshona Global Conference, a development phase of nine months will ensure that partners conduct the groundwork necessary for launching an ambitious, transformative, and credible ARA at COP26. WASP is a key partner in this endeavor. International Platform of Adaptation Metrics (IPAM) The formulation of standardized adaptation metrics is one of the great trans-disciplinary challenges of our time. Building knowledge and consensus on adaptation metrics are critical for climate adaptation policy and business imperatives at all scales, functions, and sectors, to articulate and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and for investment decision-making at scale.\u00a0We are working with IPAM so as to find a common purpose to address these concerns.",

        "meta_description": "Adaptation at Altitude : Mountains at the frontline of climate change\u00a0 Geographical scope: Global and interregional (South Caucasus, East Africa, Hindu Kush Himalaya, Andes, as well as Alps and Carpathians) Time frame: 2020-2023 Partners: Mountain Research Initiative, CONDESAN, ICIMOD, Stockholm Environment Institute, University of Geneva, Zoi Environment Network Co-financiers: Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) Contributions to SDGs: 15.4., 13.2., 13.3. Environmental challenge Given the unprecedented speed and magnitude of climate change in mountains adding to rapidly changing conditions, it is crucial that practical adaptation solutions be developed and implemented. The IPCC WGII cross-chapter on mountains finds that current adaptation efforts are insufficient to address future risks in mountain regions. It is often the coupled effects of poverty, dependence on degrading natural resources and high exposure to natural hazards where climate change puts mountain ecosystems and livelihoods under additional pressure. Effective adaptation must take an inclusive approach that addresses climate-related risks together with other socio-economic developments. This can enable mountain communities to conserve, restore and sustainably manage the key ecosystem goods and services on which their livelihoods depend. \u00a0 \u00a0 Addressing mountain-specific challenges and exploiting opportunities to adapt to changing future environments require a regional approach\u00a0due to the cross-border nature of mountain ranges. Cooperation and exchange at regional levels tap into local (traditional) knowledge, address challenges of mutual concern and support the development of adequate and regionally-tailored solutions. Strengthening regional dialogue can also help ensure that adequate mountain adaptation policies are taken on board at national levels. Programme The overall objective of the Adaptation at Altitude programme is to increase knowledge on climate change and appropriate adaptation solutions in mountains. This is then fed into science-policy platforms for informed decision-making in national, regional and global policy processes. As a result, the long-term desired impact is to increase the resilience of both mountain communities and ecosystems to climate change. The programme \u2013\u00a0which has been initiated and fully funded by the Swiss Agency of Development of Cooperation (SDC) \u2013 aims to respond to the above challenges with four goals: To improve the availability and use of mountain observation data and information on climate change impacts in mountains; To integrate mountain climate change adaptation into planning and policy processes; To strengthen and apply knowledge on climate change adaptation solutions in mountains; To ensure that major global policy processes take climate change adaptation in mountains into account. UNEP is deeply involved in the second component, which also promotes interregional dialogue and exchange. For more information and updates see: www.adaptationataltitude.org. \u00a0 \u00a0 Promoting innovations for sustainable mountain development (PRIMA) Complementing the work under the Adaptation at Altitude programme, UNEP, together with the Centre for Development and Environment (CDE) of the University of Bern, implements the two-year project (2021-23) \u201cPromoting innovations for sustainable development in mountain areas\u201d (PRIMA), funded by the Austrian Development Cooperation. The overall objective is to promote collaboration among partners and across mountain regions on innovative approaches that provide mutual benefits and enhance the effectiveness of actions towards inclusive sustainable mountain development. Activities include the publication of evidence-based innovative approaches in the open access, peer-reviewed journal titled \u201cMountain Research and Development\u201d (MRD), hosting several webinars, and organizing a first Mountain Innovation Fair as well as an award.

A number of tools for advancing\u00a0ecosystem-based adaptation.\u00a0 The Guidelines have been developed under the\u00a0National Adaptation Plan Global Support Programme\u00a0(NAP-GSP), implemented jointly by UNDP and UNEP, which supports the Least Developed Countries (LDCs)\u00a0to identify technical, institutional and financial needs to integrate climate change adaptation into medium- and long-term national planning. The programme supports countries in formulating and implementing the National Adaptation Planning under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In doing so, the NAP-GSP works with development partners to implement the Nationally Determined Contributions and promotes ambitious climate action in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals. \u00a0 Further Resources UNEP Web Story:\u00a0New guidelines to help states adapt to climate change Learn more about UNEP's work in ecosystem-based adaptation here.

        "meta_description": "Did you know that protecting the world\u2019s forests and mangroves could prevent a loss of around USD$500 billion every year from the impacts of climate change? UNEP and UNEP-WCMC are now bringing you an online training course on how we can adapt to the impacts of climate change by integrating Nature-based Solutions into National Adaptation Plans. Experts claim that National Adaptation Plans and using Nature-based Solutions are among the most important ways a country can ensure it adapts to climate change. This new online course explores the profound advantages and strengths of combining these two approaches and ensuring that National Adaptation Plans harness the power of Nature-based Solutions. The 60-90-minute course not only looks at the extraordinary opportunities, but crucially, the severe risks of failing to recognize and incorporate nature into these plans. A unique feature of the online course is that participants can explore an interactive landscape online that models the impacts of climate change on the ecosystem and the optimum nature-based solutions. The launch event will include a demo on this new interactive feature. Whether you\u2019re in the public sector, private sector, civil society or academia, this course has something to offer for you!\u00a0 For any questions, please contact Lou.Perpes@un.org",

        "meta_description": "Jointly published with the Children and Youth Major Group to UNEP (CYMG), this report provides an updated analysis of global waste generation and management since 2018.\u00a0 The original Global Waste Management Outlook is a response to UNEP Resolutions 2/7 and 4/7, offering an updated assessment of global waste management. The report provides data analysis, explores different waste management scenarios, and evaluates their impacts on society, the environment, and the economy. It offers guidance for stakeholders, including multinational development banks, national governments, municipalities, the private sector, and citizens, with a particular focus on young people. Waste pollution poses significant risks to infants, children, and youth, affecting their health due to their developing bodies and vulnerable immune systems. Contamination from landfills and hazardous waste, along with inadequate waste management, increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal disorders, and developmental delays. Engaging youth in combating waste pollution is crucial, as they will face the long-term consequences of today\u2019s waste management practices. The Youth Summary of the Global Waste Management Outlook 2024 aims to equip young people with the knowledge and tools needed to address these challenges. By empowering youth, we can harness their energy, creativity, and commitment to drive transformative change and secure a healthier, more sustainable future for all.\u00a0 Further Resources: Global Waste Management Outlook 2024",

de los estados unidos terry gerlach resumi\u00f3 cinco estimaciones anteriores de la tasas de emisi\u00f3n global de di\u00f3xido de carbono volc\u00e1nico que hab\u00edan sido publicadas entre 1991 1998 estas estimaciones incluyeron estudios que databan de la d\u00e9cada de 1970 que se basaron en una gran variedad de mediciones como muestreo directo teledetecci\u00f3n satelital la estimaciones globales se ubicaron en un rango de aproximadamente 03 015 mil millones de toneladas m\u00e9tricas de di\u00f3xido de carbono por a\u00f1o lo cual significa que la emisiones humanas de di\u00f3xido de carbono fueron m\u00e1s de 90 veces mayores que la emisiones globales de di\u00f3xido de carbono provenientes de volcanes el 18 de mayo de 1980 el monte saint helen sufri\u00f3 una erupci\u00f3n explosiva emitiendo una columna de cenizas vapor gas de hasta 60000 pie por sobre el nivel del mar durante aproximadamente nueve horas la emisiones de di\u00f3xido de carbono del volc\u00e1n podr\u00edan haber alcanzado la emisiones humanas pero erupciones tan masivas son raras pasajeras foto del servicio geol\u00f3gico de los estados unidos por robert krimmel en 2013 otro grupo de cient\u00edficosmichael burton georgina sawyer domenico granieripublicaron una estimaci\u00f3n actualizada usando m\u00e1s datos sobre la emisiones de di\u00f3xido de carbono del magma de superficie que estuvieron disponibles a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de la \u00faltima estimaci\u00f3n global si bien los autores identificaron un rango amplio de variabilidad en la estimaciones concluyeron que la mejor estimaci\u00f3n general era de aproximadamente 06 mil millones de toneladas m\u00e9tricas de di\u00f3xido de carbono por a\u00f1o si bien e m\u00e1s alta que la estimaci\u00f3n de gerlach la cantidad sigue siendo s\u00f3lo una fracci\u00f3n de la producci\u00f3n de di\u00f3xido de carbono proveniente de la actividades humanas gerlach coment\u00f3 en un correo electr\u00f3nico tomado al pie de la letra sus resultados significan que el co antropog\u00e9nico excede el co volc\u00e1nico global por al menos un factor de 60 veces ocasionalmente la erupciones son lo suficientemente potentes como para liberar di\u00f3xido de carbono una tasa que iguala incluso excede la tasa global de emisiones humanas durante unas pocas horas por ejemplo gerlach estim\u00f3 que la erupciones del monte saint helen 1980 pinatubo 1991 liberaron di\u00f3xido de carbono en una escala similar la producci\u00f3n humana durante casi nueve horas la emisiones humanas de di\u00f3xido de carbono contin\u00faan d\u00eda tras d\u00eda me tras me a\u00f1o tras a\u00f1o la actividad volc\u00e1nica actual puede parecer menor en comparaci\u00f3n la emisiones de di\u00f3xido de carbono que estamos generando con la quema de combustible f\u00f3siles para producir energ\u00eda pero en el transcurso del tiempo geol\u00f3gico los volcanes han ocasionalmente contribuido al calentamiento global con la producci\u00f3n de cantidades significativas de di\u00f3xido de carbono otros gas de efecto invernadero por ejemplo algunos ge\u00f3logos plantean la hip\u00f3tesis de que hace 250 millones de a\u00f1os una extensa inundaci\u00f3n de lava eman\u00f3 de manera continuum desde la tierra en siberia tal vez por cientos de mile de a\u00f1os esta erupci\u00f3n gran escala de larga duraci\u00f3n probablemente elev\u00f3 la temperaturas globales lo suficiente como para causar una de la mayores extinciones en la historia de nuestro planeta la actividad volc\u00e1nica actual ocurre en una escala tan masiva hoy en d\u00eda m\u00e1s que calentar el clima global la erupciones volc\u00e1nicas frecuentemente tienen un efecto opuesto eso e porque el di\u00f3xido de carbono e lo \u00fanico que los volcanes inyectan en la atm\u00f3sfera incluso la erupciones peque\u00f1as con frecuencia producen cenizas volc\u00e1nicas part\u00edculas de aerosol tomada por astronautas del transbordador espacial

        "meta_description": "With the introduction of targeted policies and measures in recent decades, the emission of most air pollutants from transport in the EU-27 has decreased. Reductions in the road transport sector account for the greatest share of this progress, while emissions from shipping and aviation increased for some pollutants. The dramatic reduction in transport volumes linked to the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant but only temporary reductions in emissions, and an upturn in pollution from transportation is already visible for 2021 and 2022 alongside the rebound of transport volumes.",

        "meta_description": "Between 2004 and 2022, emissions from large combustion plants in the EU decreased: sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and dust by 92%, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 70%. Declines in emissions and improvements in environmental performance were largely driven by European policy, which sets legally binding emission limit values. Fossil fuel useage decreased by 35% as energy production shifts to climate-friendly sources, even if coal has returned as the most used fuel in large combustion plants in Europe. Stricter emission limit values and policies aimed at increasing the use of renewable or cleaner fuels are expected to drive further declines in combustion plant emissions in coming years.",
