This is over 50 per cent higher than the previous range estimate.  The modelled costs of adaptation in developing countries are estimated at US$215 billion per year this decade. The adaptation finance needed to implement domestic adaptation priorities is estimated at US$387 billion per year.   Despite these needs, public multilateral and bilateral adaptation finance flows to developing countries declined by 15 per cent to US$21 billion in 2021. As a result of the growing adaptation finance needs and faltering flows, the current adaptation finance gap is now estimated at US$194-366 billion per year. At the same time, adaptation planning and implementation appear to be plateauing. This failure to adapt has massive implications for losses and damages, particularly for the most vulnerable.  This report identifies seven ways to increase financing, including through domestic expenditure and international and private sector finance. Additional avenues include remittances, increasing and tailoring finance to Small and Medium Enterprises and a reform of the global financial architecture. The new Loss and Damage fund will also need to move towards more innovative financing mechanisms to reach the necessary scale of investment.  Underfinanced, Underprepared. The adaptation finance needed to implement domestic adaptation priorities is estimated at US$387 billion per year.  This report identifies seven ways to increase financing, including through domestic expenditure and international and private sector finance.  The need for adaptation is urgently growing as the climate crisis unfolds and worsens.

The report is the 14  edition in a series that brings together many of the world’s top climate scientists to look at future trends in greenhouse gas emissions and provide potential solutions to the challenge of global warming. The report finds that there has been progress since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. Greenhouse gas emissions in 2030, based on policies in place, were projected to increase by 16 per cent at the time of the agreement’s adoption. Today, the projected increase is 3 per cent. However, predicted 2030 greenhouse gas emissions still must fall by 28 per cent for the Paris Agreement 2°C pathway and 42 per cent for the 1.5°C pathway. As things stand, fully implementing unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) made under the Paris Agreement would put the world on track for limiting temperature rise to 2.9°C above pre-industrial levels this century. Fully implementing conditional NDCs would lower this to 2.5°C. The EGR report calls for all nations to accelerate economy-wide, low-carbon development transformations. Countries with greater capacity and responsibility for emissions will need to take more ambitious action and support developing nations as they pursue low-emissions development growth. The report looks at how stronger implementation can increase the chances of the next round of NDCs, due in 2025, bringing down greenhouse gas emissions in 2035 to levels consistent with 2°C and 1.5°C pathways. It also looks at the potential and risks of Carbon Dioxide Removal methods – such as nature-based solutions and direct air carbon capture and storage. The Emissions Gap Report is UNEP's spotlight report launched annually in advance of the annual Climate negotiations. The EGR tracks the gap between where global emissions are heading with current country commitments and where they ought to be to limit warming to 1.5°C. Each edition explores ways to bridge the emissions gap. The world is witnessing a disturbing acceleration in the number, speed and scale of broken climate records. At the time of writing, 86 days have been recorded with temperatures exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels this year. Humanity is breaking all the wrong records on climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions and the global average temperature are hitting new highs, while extreme weather events are occurring more often, developing faster and becoming more intense. © 2024 UNEP            "},

Without profound changes to these sectors and a drastic cut to carbon footprints, there is little hope of protecting the planet from the devastating effects of a warmer world. This live feed will keep you up-to-date with all the latest news from the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as the   to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan.  In what is probably an overlooked section of the draft texts released earlier today, the decision on who will host COP31 in 2026 won't be decided until June next year at the earliest.  Both Turkey and Australia - co-hosting with one or more Pacific island nations - want to host the event, but neither is willing to withdraw their candidacy. Of the 29 COPs, six have been held in the southern hemisphere and 23 in the northern hemisphere. The new draft texts have just been released by  , and the key takeaway is that developing countries should receive US$250 billion per year by 2035 for climate action. This is to come from \"a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources.\" While it also \"calls for a finance target of US$1.3 trillion by 2035, it also \"invites developing countries to make additional contributions\".  These figures will see lots of back and forth over the rest of the day, but at least there are figures to work with now. How developing countries will react to this text remains to be seen however. Hundreds of scientists from around the world are in the midst of drafting a landmark report to help government leaders and other decision makers counter some of the world’s most acute environmental ills. The  , will provide a comprehensive overview of the latest environmental research and provide decision makers with a roadmap for addressing the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss including desertification and pollution and waste.  The European Union released its first   (BTR) this morning, highlighting the importance of transparency in achieving the Paris Agreement goals.   The EU’s BTR revealed a 37 per cent drop in net greenhouse gas emissions since 1990, with a potential pathway to a 90 per cent net greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2040.  Transparency is a key component of the Paris Agreement. Countries submit their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - their plans on how they will reduce emissions – every five years, with the next round of NDCs due in February 2025. As part of this, most countries are expected to submit their first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) this month.  BTRs are progress reports that provide information on national emissions levels and mitigation efforts as well as adaptation measures. They provide a snapshot of progress in achieving the NDCs goals. For more information on why transparency matters, check out this handy video: Talks are still deadlocked in Baku on a number of issues, particularly climate finance – with disagreement about how much developing countries should receive annually by 2030 and where that money should come from.   Developing countries want US$1.3 trillion a year, but the draft text released yesterday had just an “X” where a figure should be, illustrating how far apart negotiators are.  The EU has said it wants more money to come from the private sector, while developing countries want the money to come in the form of grants, not loans.  About 80 of the most vulnerable countries represented by ministers from  the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean  yesterday. It included a proposal to finalise a deal on grant-based public money and agree on roadmap to COP29 in Brazil on which sources could bridge the gap to $1.3 trillion.   They said redirecting   and other sources of public finance towards climate action could be a solution, as could levies on aviation and shipping as well as taxes on wealth and major polluters. The COP29 Presidency has said it will aim to release a new draft of texts later today with a view to sending out the final text later this evening, although no one in Baku is expecting COP29 to finish this evening.       Nature-based Solutions are key to solving the interlinked crises we now face. That was the message from UNEP’s Executive Director, Inger Andersen at  .  She highlighted how Nature-based Solutions help to:  “Cut greenhouse gas emissions and increase adaptation to climate impacts under the Paris Agreement. That halt and reverse biodiversity loss under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. That meet land degradation neutrality goals under the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. That deliver on the SDGs and more.”  Andersen also highlighted how these solutions are not just good for the climate, for nature and for people, but also good for business.   “Much of the global economy is dependent on nature and its services. UNEP recognizes this by supporting Nature-based Solutions and Ecosystem-based Adaptation through nearly 90 global projects, restoring 324,000 hectares and benefiting 3.5 million people.” It’s the (most likely) final day in Baku, with negotiations coming down the wire. The hope is that the multiple gaps between countries can be bridged, and a final text is released that enables countries most vulnerable to climate change to transition to a sustainable future and protect themselves from the effects of climate change.  Yesterday the COP Presidency announced that the revised presidency texts would be released late on Friday. We will keep you posted on developments as they happen.   Narrated by Don Cheadle, learn about   and the leaders, activists and entrepreneurs building scalable climate solutions across the world.  Every fraction of a degree matters, every climate action counts.  There have been calls for the world not to go backwards on cutting emissions after some countries expressed dismay that the draft text released earlier today was not strong enough on emissions cuts - which are necessary if the world is to avoid devastating climate chaos. , which includes Costa Rica, France, Greenland, the Marshall Islands and other nations, released a statement on Thursday calling for nations to stick to their 2023 pledge to begin the transition away from fossil fuels. At least year's COP28 in Dubai, countries agreed to \"transition away from fossil fuels\" but that line was missing from the draft text released earlier today in Baku.  Colombian Environment Minister, Susana Muhamed pointed out the necessity of such a transition: \"What is the point of having an agreement and a convention if we cannot deal with the issue that creates the problem,” she asked. This was echoed by Ed Miliband, the UK minister for energy security and net zero, who said that in a world facing increasing disasters, “standing still is a retreat”. Duong Khanh Ly, the founder of a tea cooperative in northeast Viet Nam, had a problem.   Severe downpours would often soak tea leaves that had been left outside to dry, spoiling entire batches and cutting into the profits of the co-operative’s 15 female members.   So, Duong approached CHIASE, a non-governmental organization and partner of the United Nations’   programme, which helps women become more resilient in the face of climate change.  Launched in 2018, EmPower is led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and UN Women. The effort is designed to tackle a problem many women face across the Asia-Pacific region: a lack of access to credit.    © 2024 UNEP            "},

Despite commitments under the Global Methane Pledge to slash emissions 30 per cent by 2030,   highlights that methane plume alerts from the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS), part of UNEP’s International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO), represent an untapped opportunity for immediate climate action.   Atmospheric methane is the second biggest driver of anthropogenic global warming after carbon dioxide (CO ) and is over 80 times more powerful than CO  in the near-term. Global methane emissions must be reduced 40-45 per cent by 2030 to achieve cost-effective pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C. Yet   shows atmospheric concentrations of methane rising at record speed over the past 5 years. “To have any chance of getting global warming under control, methane emissions must come down, and come down fast,” said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director. “We now have a proven system to identify major leaks so they can be quickly stopped – often with simple repairs. We are quite literally talking about screwing bolts tighter in some cases. “Governments and oil and gas companies must stop paying lip-service to this challenge when answers are staring them in the face. Instead, they should recognise the significant opportunity this presents and start responding to alerts by plugging leaks that are spewing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere. The tools are ready, the targets are set – now it is time to act.” While methane responses must rapidly grow, there are examples of nations and companies responding – proving the value of data-driven solutions like MARS. In 2024, IMEO verified action to reduce emissions from major leaks in Azerbaijan and the United States.  In Algeria and Nigeria MARS notifications and engagement led to direct action from the governments and oil and gas companies to address large methane leaks. In the Algerian case, which saw methane leaks take place for years, the annual avoided emissions are equivalent to 500,000 cars being taken off the road. In Nigeria case, the six-month leak emitted methane equivalent to 400,000 cars being driven for a year and was able to be fixed in under two weeks by simply replacing faulty equipment. Beyond addressing major emissions seen from space, the systems exist for industry to manage its methane footprint. UNEP’s   (OGMP 2.0), an initiative for oil and gas companies to measure and reduce their methane emissions. OGMP 2.0 added 20 members over the past year, growing to 140 members covering more than 40 per cent of global production. 2024 is the first year that OGMP 2.0 began awarding its “Gold Standard reporting” to companies that report their emissions at the highest data quality levels. So far in 2024, 55 companies have achieved Gold Standard reporting. Moving all companies across the sector to OGMP 2.0 Gold Standard emissions reporting is necessary to effectively target mitigation with measurement-based data and track performance against pledges to reduce emissions, such as the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter announced at COP28.  IMEO has also launched the   to spark further action. The platform delivers open, reliable and actionable global methane emissions data to drive impactful methane mitigation action by governments and companies, while providing transparent, reliable data to civil society and media.  IMEO is also stepping up its work on methane emissions from other sources with a new Steel Methane Programme. Methane emissions from metallurgical coal used in steel production represent on average 30 per cent of steel’s near-term climate footprint. These emissions can be mitigated at roughly one per cent of the price of steel. The new programme provides a framework for reducing the climate footprint of the steel sector as the industry transitions to green alternatives. MARS is being expanded to cover metallurgical coal production and identify further mitigation opportunities.  : : \"Methane emissions are a powerful driver of climate change, and the EU is determined to cut down these emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. Credible data is essential to achieve the goals of the Global Methane Pledge. As importing markets, like the EU, increasingly demand cleaner fuels and transparency on emissions, UNEP’s IMEO is delivering data that enables informed decision-making and drives accountability. I therefore welcome the comprehensive report that is launched today.” Methane is a very aggressive greenhouse gas. However, it has one advantage: it is much easier to reduce than CO2. We have to use these low-hanging fruits. As we work towards our ambitious climate goals, we need every tool available to mitigate methane emissions effectively. UNEP’s IMEO is delivering precise, data-driven insights to enable swift action. Germany is committed to supporting these innovative measures, which demonstrate that with the right data, we can achieve substantial reductions and drive global climate progress. It is now up to the polluters to avoid methane slip as far as possible. The techniques for this are available. This is more than indicated in view of the ongoing global climate change.\" : \"For Nigeria, acting on methane emissions is not just about climate responsibility, but also about local health and sustainable development. Nigeria is proud to partner with UNEP’s IMEO and the European Commission on scientific research to measure emissions across sectors and enable methane action in Nigeria. We are committed to using these insights to further our emissions reduction goals and fulfill our commitment as a Global Methane Pledge Champion.\" : \"The data and transparency UNEP’s IMEO provides are invaluable for accountability and action. The Global Methane Hub supports this initiative, recognizing the critical role of reliable data in turning pledges into emission reductions. We need to scale these efforts to bring integrity and independent verification of mitigation claims.\"   UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

Transboundary climate risks include food and water shortages, threats to trade and energy supplies, widening inequalities, forced migrations and geopolitical conflicts. At last year’s UN Climate Change Conference, Parties recognised that climate change impacts are often transboundary and involve complex, cascading risks that require knowledge-sharing and international cooperation.

The effort is outfitting   with low-cost, energy-efficient light-emitting-diodes or LED lighting, which will allow school administrators to save money and keep lights on longer.   The project is a collaboration with  , a UN-hosted initiative, and Kenya’s Ministry of Education. It is part of   by Kenya to improve energy efficiency, which is a key component of the country’s plans to expand access to affordable renewable power.  “Energy efficiency is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to improve living standards and counter climate change globally and it does not require fundamental changes to existing energy systems,” says John Christensen, Director of the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre.    Data from the International Energy Agency suggests that energy efficiency globally could deliver   of the emissions cuts necessary to meet the goals of the   on climate change, which aims to keep global warming well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. At COP28 Dubai last year,   to double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements every year until 2030. UNEP’s   also highlighted the need for countries to outline in their Nationally Determined Contributions how they plan to achieve these energy efficiency improvements.    Embracing energy efficiency – and LED lights in particular – could pay big dividends in countries struggling to power their schools. Globally, 25 per cent of primary schools and about 15 per cent of secondary schools lack access to electricity, affecting 186 million children,  . Even in schools with electricity, inefficient lighting means many struggle to afford electricity bills, resulting in outages.  Lighting is responsible for about half of electricity consumption in Kenya’s schools, according to   by the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre. That is largely due to a reliance on incandescent bulbs, which have a filament that is heated until it glows, and fluorescent lighting, which generates gas from atomic collisions. Both those processes are inefficient compared to LED lighting, which passes an electrical current through a microchip, illuminating tiny light sources.   In Kenyan schools, LEDs are freeing up resources that can be reinvested in other needs, such as schoolbooks, sports equipment, and teacher training.  Menegai High School’s principal, John Ngunyi, said the switch to LEDs, which began in September, will benefit more than 2500 students.   “The LED system will increase the amount of time that the students have for studying and the amount of time that they can have the lights on,” he says.   The LED bulbs are provided by the  , a charity arm of Signify, a global lighting manufacturer. Eric Otenio, Signify’s Program Manager for Sub-Saharan Africa, highlights that LED bulbs are much easier on students’ eyes. “They reduce flickering and therefore eyestrain and headaches,” he says. He also points out that LED bulbs need to be replaced much less frequently than fluorescent bulbs, thereby reducing waste.    As school principal Ngunyi points out, it is not just the students who will benefit from the new lighting system: “[In the past] we limited the lights for the cooks and the watchmen, telling them not to put the lights on until a certain time.” Once the new LED lights are installed, Ngunyi says he won’t worry about the school’s month-end electricity bill.   The LED lighting pilot project will be completed by the end of 2024 and will see more than 10,000 traditional fluorescent lamps replaced. That is expected to result in savings of more than US$213,000 a year across the 100 schools, a   reduction in their current power bills. It will save power equivalent to the release of 460,000kg of carbon dioxide annually.   “This is a win-win for schools,” says Christensen. “And it highlights the huge impact something relatively simple to implement can have on the lives of students.”      © 2024 UNEP            "},

UNEP subsequently established the  , which includes 25 experts from Member States and 10 representatives from major groups and stakeholders to guide the report’s creation. UNEP will publish GEO-7 at UNEA-7 in December 2025.  To learn more about how governments will inform and benefit from GEO-7, UNEP spoke with Edgar Gutierrez-Espeleta, a co-chair of the report and former Minister for Environment and Energy of Costa Rica from 2014 to 2018.    : GEO is an assessment of the latest science. We use all the reports that are already out there, and we review everything so policymakers can see the problem and be motivated to take the action needed.   GEO-7 will mark, as we say in Spanish,  (a before and after). From GEO-7, we're going to start looking at things differently. We are trying to bring a synergistic view to the equation, not a siloed view, so that we can develop solutions to put on the table for decision makers. Its 21 chapters cover basically everything about the state of the environment.     : GEO-7 is very focused on solutions. We're providing readers not only solutions pathways, but also outlooks. One focus is what will happen in years 2050 and 2100 if we follow the current business-as-usual scenario. That is very useful for decision makers to realize how important it is to act now to change the direction where we are headed.  Environmental issues are no longer just environment issues. They affect the economy, social security, housing, agriculture, transport, the health sector – everything. GEO-7 makes those connections, providing insights into how, when we end environmental degradation, we can tackle other issues as well.   : It is very important. The Intergovernmental and Multi-stakeholder Advisory Group approves the way forward, outlining the budget, approach and scope. The body has already provided feedback about the report’s scope and how to manage problems. We maintain very close contact with Member States and every time the authors for GEO-7 meet, we also have a meeting with this body.    : Member States have provided names of scientists who can   parts of the report. This is a process that is engaging more than 300 scientists around the world, but the more scientists are engaged, the better the report will be. There are plenty of possibilities for people to engage, like writing, reviewing and editing. It is also very important for scientists from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Eastern Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean to bring their knowledge, inputs and views so that we can enrich GEO-7.    : We're already producing the second draft, which is going to include an executive summary that will be appealing to policymakers. We have executive summaries for each chapter, and we are producing a summary aimed solely at decision makers.    : GEO has prompted a lot of integrated environmental assessments at the  . But with GEO-7, we are expecting to go beyond that. For example, social media plays an important role. There is a team thinking about how we are going to reach new audiences, how we are going to disseminate this to different segments of the population – youth, universities and policymakers. This is an important part of GEO-7.    : I will be very, very happy if GEO-7 can influence policymaking decisions at all levels and move ministers of environment, finance, industry, agriculture and more to stop environmental degradation. We have to realize that if we keep on doing business as usual, we are not going to have enough land to produce food to eat in  .  Once you are in politics, you are not always worrying about what is going to happen in 2050. Instead, you’re worried about what's happening in the next three years because then elections come, and you need votes. But that sort of vision is taking us closer to the abyss.   We need to think in the long term, and we need to be brave enough to take action. I think GEO-7 will contribute to this if it is read properly.        © 2024 UNEP            "},

Clean water and air. Medicines, cultural heritage and more. This is all true. But framing biodiversity as a resource – something separate, something that gives – has led to humanity converting nature, driving species to extinction, polluting ecosystems and pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  But humanity is not separate from or above biodiversity. This is never more apparent than when we spend time in nature. The science clearly shows that reconnecting with our ancient habitats, be it by walking in forests or plunging into cool lakes, produces mood-boosting endorphins. Being in nature is good for our mental health because it feels like a homecoming.  So, humanity undoubtedly is biodiversity, part of a complex web of interdependent species that has evolved over billions of years. And in a closed system such as Earth, what goes around comes around.  Two viruses have spilled over to humans per year for a century, most devastatingly in the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate change could lead to 250,000 extra deaths each year from 2030-2050. Antimicrobial resistance, strongly linked to environmental pathways, is currently predicted to claim 39 million lives between 2025-2050. When we harm biodiversity, we harm ourselves. Humanity is at least finally learning.

And, of course, the Global Action Plan on Biodiversity and Health is on the agenda of this  . We must adopt this action plan and implement it with a holistic, systemic approach that unifies action across health, environment, finance, industry and agriculture. One Health means One Society and One Economy. Everything is connected. At the forefront of efforts should be Indigenous Peoples, who never forgot that humanity is part of nature, not above it. Indigenous peoples could help to solve many of the problems we face, if only we would make space for them to lead – which is why it is so powerful that Colombia has made advancing traditional knowledge a priority at COP16. Our health cannot be separated from the health of the planet and its many species. So, I call on leaders to adopt and implement the global action plan. Listen to traditional knowledge.

Malgré les engagements pris dans le cadre du Pacte mondial sur le méthane de réduire les émissions de 30 % d'ici 2030,  ( Un œil sur le méthane :rapport 2024 de l’observatoire international des émissions de méthane) souligne que les alertes au panache de méthane émises par le système d'alerte et de réaction au méthane (MARS), qui fait partie de l'Observatoire international des émissions de méthane (IMEO) du PNUE, représentent une occasion inexploitée d'agir immédiatement en faveur du climat. Le méthane atmosphérique est le deuxième facteur de réchauffement climatique d'origine anthropique après le dioxyde de carbone ( ) et il est plus de 80 fois plus puissant que le  à court terme. Les émissions mondiales de méthane doivent être réduites de 40 à 45 % d'ici à 2030 si l'on veut trouver des solutions rentables permettant de limiter le réchauffement de la planète à 1,5 °C. Or,   montrent que les concentrations atmosphériques de méthane ont augmenté à une vitesse record au cours des cinq dernières années.  « Pour avoir une chance de maîtriser le réchauffement de la planète, les émissions de méthane doivent diminuer, et diminuer rapidement », a déclaré Inger Andersen, Directrice exécutive du PNUE. « Nous disposons désormais d'un système éprouvé pour identifier les fuites majeures afin de pouvoir les arrêter rapidement, souvent par de simples réparations. Dans certains cas, il s'agit littéralement de resserrer les boulons. « Les gouvernements et les compagnies pétrolières et gazières doivent cesser de relever ce défi du bout des lèvres, alors que les réponses leur sautent aux yeux. Ils doivent au contraire reconnaître l'opportunité considérable que cela représente et commencer à répondre aux alertes en colmatant les fuites qui rejettent dans l'atmosphère du méthane qui réchauffe le climat. Les outils sont prêts, les objectifs sont fixés - il est maintenant temps d'agir. Alors que les mesures de lutte contre le méthane doivent rapidement se développer, il existe des exemples de pays et d'entreprises qui réagissent, prouvant ainsi la valeur des solutions basées sur les données telles que MARS. En 2024, l'IMEO a vérifié les mesures prises pour réduire les émissions dues à des fuites importantes en Azerbaïdjan et aux États-Unis.  En Algérie et au Nigeria, les notifications et l'engagement de MARS ont conduit les gouvernements et les compagnies pétrolières et gazières à prendre des mesures directes pour lutter contre les grandes fuites de méthane. Dans le cas de l'Algérie, où des fuites de méthane ont eu lieu pendant des années, les émissions annuelles évitées sont équivalentes à 500 000 voitures retirées de la circulation. Dans le cas du Nigeria, la fuite, qui a duré six mois, a émis du méthane équivalant à la circulation de 400 000 voitures pendant un an et a pu être réparée en moins de deux semaines en remplaçant simplement l'équipement défectueux. Au-delà des émissions majeures observées depuis l'espace, il existe des systèmes permettant à l'industrie de gérer son empreinte en matière de méthane. Le   (OGMP 2.0) du PNUE est une initiative permettant aux compagnies pétrolières et gazières de mesurer et de réduire leurs émissions de méthane. L'OGMP 2.0 a accueilli 20 nouveaux membres au cours de l'année écoulée, pour atteindre 140 membres couvrant plus de 40 % de la production mondiale. L'IMEO a également lancé la   afin de susciter de nouvelles actions. Cette plateforme fournit des données ouvertes, fiables et exploitables sur les émissions de méthane au niveau mondial afin d'inciter les gouvernements et les entreprises à prendre des mesures efficaces de réduction des émissions de méthane, tout en fournissant des données transparentes et fiables à la société civile et aux médias.  L'IMEO intensifie également ses travaux sur les émissions de méthane provenant d'autres sources en lançant un nouveau programme sur le méthane dans l'acier. Les émissions de méthane provenant du charbon métallurgique utilisé dans la production d'acier représentent en moyenne 30 % de l'empreinte climatique à court terme de l'acier. Ces émissions peuvent être réduites pour environ un pour cent du prix de l'acier. Le nouveau programme fournit un cadre pour la réduction de l'empreinte climatique du secteur de l'acier à mesure que l'industrie se tourne vers des solutions vertes. Le programme MARS est en cours d'extension pour couvrir la production de charbon métallurgique et identifier d'autres possibilités d'atténuation.   :  « Les émissions de méthane sont un puissant moteur du changement climatique, et l'UE est déterminée à réduire ces émissions de 30 % d'ici à 2030. Des données crédibles sont essentielles pour atteindre les objectifs du Pacte mondial sur le méthane. Alors que les marchés importateurs, comme l'UE, exigent de plus en plus de carburants plus propres et de transparence sur les émissions, l'IMEO du PNUE fournit des données qui permettent de prendre des décisions en connaissance de cause et de rendre des comptes. Je me réjouis donc du rapport complet qui est présenté aujourd'hui ». Le méthane est un gaz à effet de serre très agressif. Il présente toutefois un avantage : il est beaucoup plus facile à réduire que le CO2. Nous devons utiliser ces fruits à portée de main. Alors que nous nous efforçons d'atteindre nos objectifs climatiques ambitieux, nous avons besoin de tous les outils disponibles pour atténuer efficacement les émissions de méthane. L'IMEO du PNUE fournit des informations précises et fondées sur des données afin de permettre une action rapide. L'Allemagne s'est engagée à soutenir ces mesures innovantes, qui démontrent qu'avec les bonnes données, nous pouvons parvenir à des réductions substantielles et faire progresser le climat mondial. Il appartient désormais aux pollueurs d'éviter autant que possible les rejets de méthane. Les techniques pour ce faire sont disponibles. C'est plus qu'indiqué compte tenu du changement climatique mondial en cours ».  : « Pour le Nigeria, agir sur les émissions de méthane n'est pas seulement une question de responsabilité climatique, mais aussi de santé locale et de développement durable. Le Nigeria est fier de s'associer à l'IMEO du PNUE et à la Commission européenne dans le cadre d'une recherche scientifique visant à mesurer les émissions dans tous les secteurs et à permettre une action sur le méthane au Nigeria. Nous nous engageons à utiliser ces connaissances pour atteindre nos objectifs de réduction des émissions et remplir notre engagement en tant que champion du Pacte mondial sur le méthane ». : « Les données et la transparence fournies par l'IMEO du PNUE sont inestimables pour la responsabilité et l'action. Le Hub mondial du méthane soutient cette initiative, reconnaissant le rôle essentiel de données fiables pour transformer les engagements en réductions d'émissions. Nous devons intensifier ces efforts afin d'assurer l'intégrité et la vérification indépendante des déclarations d'atténuation.

Here’s why.", "meta_description": "The 8th World One Health Congress – one of the world’s largest forums dedicated to advancing One Health science and policy - kicks off in Cape Town, South Africa.", "content": "How do you make the people of the world healthier? For the longest time, the answer was to treat the myriad ailments that plague the human race.   But in recent years, experts have come to have a more expansive view of health. Many are finally acknowledging that human health is inextricably linked to the health of animals, both wild and domestic, and the health of the planet.      This philosophy is embodied in what is known as the   approach. It posits that people can’t be healthy if they are drinking polluted water or living side-by-side with disease carrying livestock, and calls for holistic solutions that make people, animals and the planet better off.   “The environment is an essential pillar of the One Health approach,” says Doreen Lynn Robinson, Director of Biodiversity and Land at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) “Tackling the triple planetary crisis of  ,  , and   will help foster a sustainable future where people, animals and the planet can thrive together,” she says.   From 20 – 23 September, scientists, policymakers, representatives of international institutions, civil society and the private sector will gather in Cape Town, South Africa for   dedicated to advancing the One Health approach.   The meeting comes ahead of the 16  Conference of the Parties to the Convention of Biological Diversity in Cali, Colombia. At this key October global gathering, countries are expected to adopt an international plan designed to bolster biodiversity and improve human health. Ahead of those gatherings, we sat down with UNEP’s Robinson to discuss the central role that the environment plays in achieving the long-term goals of One Health.       One Health is based on the principle that you cannot have healthy people in an unhealthy environment and that the health of humans, animals and ecosystems are deeply intertwined. Addressing one aspect without considering the others will only lead to incomplete or unsustainable solutions.     : One Health has traditionally been concerned mostly with public and animal health. That has sometimes come at the cost of understanding how biodiversity loss, pollution and climate change can exacerbate health risks, including the spread of antimicrobial resistance and diseases such as  ,   and  .  At the same time, the environment is the source of health solutions, as it provides the ecosystem services to offer clean water and air, nutrient rich and diverse diets and medicines.   The Cape Town congress will explore these links. There will be   that examines how intensive livestock rearing has fostered the spread of zoonotic diseases through pathogens that jump between animals and humans.   Also on the agenda will be a session on how the overuse of antibiotics is feeding the rise of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics. As well, the gathering will look at how to better integrate the viewpoints of women, youth and   into the One Health approach.      We know that healthy ecosystems act as natural buffers between wildlife, livestock and humans, and can reduce the chances that diseases will jump between the three groups. Unfortunately, industrial agriculture, deforestation and other human activities are shrinking natural spaces. This changes many factors tied to disease risk, including potentially driving up risks from those pathogens capable of causing a pandemic.    UNEP is the world’s leading authority on the environment, and we have spent more than five decades working to conserve, restore and sustainably use ecosystems. We’re bringing that experience to the  , and helping countries and communities around the world rebuild their natural defense against many health threats, from disease to malnutrition to respiratory and water-borne illnesses.       Implementing the GBF by promoting healthy ecosystems, means unpolluted water, breathable air, non-toxic food, better management of interactions between humans and wild animals to avoid spread of disease, strengthened traditional knowledge for medicines and well-being and many other things.   One Health can contribute to achieving the   by fostering collaboration across sectors to find solutions that achieve real co-benefits. One Health practitioners can jointly manage medical waste much better, including chemicals and plastics, so that it doesn’t wind up in our rivers and oceans. They can change farming and land use practices to reduce land degradation and halt the conversion of healthy ecosystems which are currently eating away at the very foundation for life on earth for all of us.     The Biodiversity and Health Action Plan is essentially a bridge that connects the environment and human health. It will include recommendations designed to help countries bolster their biodiversity, including by protecting and restoring natural spaces, while at the same time, improving the health of people. It encourages governments to take a holistic view when making policy, including, for example, linking  national health strategies with national plans to protect biodiversity. The one health approach will be important for implementation of this plan and so it is essential that parties adopt the plan at the COP.     We need all hands on deck. Governments must incorporate One Health principles into national policies, including through creating regulations that address the interconnection between human health, animal health and ecosystems.    We need financial investments in One Health that go well beyond a disease only focus, including funding for research and the implementation of on-the-ground projects. We need to build skills and capacities of human and animal health professionals and environmental practitioners on the One Health approach, so they can deliver critical integrated solutions in communities around the world. This is especially the case in developing countries where the necessary financial resources and capacity are comparatively limited. And we need to raise awareness about One Health, and particularly the environmental aspects, among the public.     Yes. Progress has already been made in a lot of these areas. But there’s no doubt we need to ramp up these efforts if we’re going to create a healthier future for all living things on this planet.            © 2024 UNEP            "},

As the world contends with increasing extreme climate events, such as droughts, floods and wildfires, NSAs can play a critical role in strengthening climate action, experts say. However, their role in national climate efforts remains largely undocumented, according to the UNEP report, prepared with support from the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre (UNEP-CCC) and Danish think tank Concito. The   report evaluates national transparency efforts to suggest how to better integrate NSA actions into countries’ policies under the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) of the Paris Agreement. This can ensure stronger climate action and build trust and confidence among Member States. \"In the ongoing battle against climate change, it is becoming increasingly evident that non-state actors, including non-governmental organizations, businesses, cities and local communities, have significant potential to strengthen and support national climate efforts,” said John Christensen, Director of the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre and lead author of the report. “Regrettably, there is a real gap between national efforts under the Enhanced Transparency Framework and the actual contributions of NSAs.   “With better integration in national efforts, NSAs can actively respond to government policies, link and strengthen their own climate strategies – including specific emission reduction targets – bolster technical expertise and capacity, and aid in the local execution of national policy objectives.” The foundation of the global climate regime lies in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, primarily through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The credibility of this international accord hinges on countries’ ability to fulfill their obligations, document results transparently, and report progress effectively. However, not all commitments are subject to the same criteria and benchmarks, allowing certain actors, such as fossil fuel companies, to make incomplete pledges that UN Secretary-General António Guterres   earlier this year as “rank deception” and a “toxic cover-up”. The ETF therefore plays a pivotal role in documenting climate action and monitoring individual countries' progress to ultimately drive increased collective ambition under the Paris Agreement.  aims to help bolster connections between NSAs and the ETF. NSA commitments – including credible annual disclosures of greenhouse gas data, standardization of methods and protocols, independent verification – are critical to addressing the climate crisis. Linking these to ETF standards enhances these pledges’ credibility and stimulates greater action and ambition from both governments and NSAs, experts say. By analysing how transparency efforts have evolved under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and what can be learned from this process, the report highlights the need to build on a sound scientific foundation, maintain strong monitoring, reporting, and verification efforts, and enhance capacity for actors who may lack the capability to participate. Achieving these ambitions requires participation from all stakeholders, according to the report. © 2024 UNEP            "},

These challenges undermine poverty eradication efforts and threaten the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Africa Union  ,” said Seyoum Mekonen Hailu, Ethiopia’s State Minister of Planning and Development (in charge of Environment and Climate Change) and President of the special AMCEN session. Ministers highlighted the integral work of the Africa Groups of Negotiators as they engage in several upcoming international conferences and negotiations and noted that the special session provided a clear mandate and solidly endorsed the common African positions, as well as strengthened global and regional partnerships involving governments, international organizations, civil society, academia, local communities, and the private sector.  H.E. Robert Beugré Mambé, Prime Minister of Côte d’Ivoire, emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating: \"The survival of our economies and people is at stake. In times like these, it is essential for Africa to work in synergy to tackle climate challenges. Together, we are strong.\" “Africa is a continent of solutions. Solutions to renewable energy in the form of vast solar, wind and hydro resources, and critical minerals. Solutions to food security, with fertile lands and competent farming communities. Solutions for innovation, as Africa has both youth and experience in a population eager to put its shoulder to the wheel for growth, prosperity, opportunity and development,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. Ahead of international meetings – Conferences of the Parties (COPs) - on  ,  ,  , and   later this year, UNEP’s Executive Director rallied the African Ministers to unite as they seek to address the growing impact on the continent of the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution and waste. “African nations can go to these COPs with a strong position on land. Link land restoration, land management and land productivity to climate pledges and to national biodiversity strategies and action plans,” she added. “Public and private finance needs to ramp up. Food systems need to reform. And pollution needs to be addressed. In this last regard, African nations can help deliver a strong instrument to end plastic pollution at the final round of talks in Busan at the end of this year.” Speaking at the special session, Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of UNCCD, highlighted the need to revise development policies to address the root causes of land degradation. “The land must not be seen only as a source of extraction: extraction of agricultural products, extraction of minerals, and extraction of water resources. Nor must the land be seen only through the lenses of exploitation,” he said. “As the land is our most precious asset for our food, our clothes, our fuels, and our animals' feed, we need to adopt a managerial rather than an exploitative attitude. An asset — especially such a precious asset — ought to be managed, with a whole-of-government and a whole-of-society approach.” The Abidjan Declaration also emphasized the need for innovative financing models to unlock the USD 1.2 trillion required to implement the  . In 2023, over $400 billion was spent on clean energy projects globally, but only $2.6 billion reached African nations. “In Africa, as in all regions, the climate crisis is an economic sinkhole, sucking the momentum out of economic growth. It is African nations and people who are paying the heaviest price. But it would be entirely incorrect for any world leader — especially in the G20 — to think that although this is all incredibly sad, ultimately, it’s not my problem” said Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ). As the international community looks ahead to COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, UNFCCC’s Executive Secretary called for a new international climate financial goal, firmly grounded in the needs of developing countries.  “COP29 must signal that the climate crisis is core business for every government, with finance solutions to match,” he added. Astrid Schomaker, Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), highlighted the growing leadership of African nations in establishing effective coordination bodies that support the alignment of various Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs). “We have seen a number of African countries set up coordination bodies that support dialogue and alignment across various Multilateral Environmental Agreements. These experiences should be replicated across the continent and beyond,” she said, emphasizing the importance of collaborative approaches in environmental governance. Requested by the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment at its 17  ordinary session, UNEP and the African Development Bank also presented a teaser of the soon to be launched   during this special session in Abidjan; the Atlas highlights Africa's rich natural resources and the urgent need for its sustainable management. Africa holds 8% of the world’s natural gas, 12% of its oil reserves, and 30% of global mineral deposits. Its fisheries are valued at over $24 billion, and it contains more than 60% of the world’s undeveloped arable land.  Ministers also endorsed an   on advancing Africa’s common positions at Conferences of the Parties and other meetings.  The 10  Special Session of AMCEN, held on 5 and 6 September, followed a Regional Consultative Meeting of UNEP Major Groups and Stakeholders and an Expert Group Meeting focusing on the severity of droughts due to rising global temperatures and land degradation.  The   sets the environmental agenda in Africa.

In April, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Switzerland   under European law to combat climate change. And last month, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea – a United Nations body – said countries have   to safeguard the ocean from greenhouse gas emissions.   These are the latest victories in an ongoing legal battle over climate change action. Backed by a series of landmark rulings, citizens, non-profit groups and disaster-wracked countries are increasingly turning to courts to compel governments and fossil fuel producers to address the  . This year promises to be a seminal one for climate litigation, experts say, with several key cases to be heard in courts around the world.  \"We have seen an accelerating wave of climate litigation in national and sub-national court rooms since we started tracking this seven years ago,” says Andrew Raine, Deputy Director of the Law Division at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “This year is particularly significant as litigation has also recently started – for the first time – in international courts and tribunals.\"   One Caribbean island nation, Antigua and Barbuda, is at the forefront of this push. It has backed a   requesting the International Court of Justice to weigh in on the obligations of states in respect of climate change.   That case, still in progress, comes with the country facing increasingly severe weather. In 2017,   devastated the nation of 93,000 people, leaving it with a US$220 million recovery bill. At the same time, warming waters have bleached many of the country’s coral reefs while rising sea waters are eroding beaches and damaging the tourism industry, a key source of revenue.   Zachary Phillips is a Crown Counsel within the Attorney General’s Chambers of Antigua and Barbuda and a member of the country’s delegation to the   (UNFCC), a global agreement to counter the climate crisis. He has clear memories of Irma. “Ninety-six per cent of all infrastructure on Barbuda was completely destroyed,” he says. “Hurricanes are something I have experienced since I was a child but I have seen an increase in their severity.”   A   released last year revealed the number of climate change litigation cases rose to 2,180 in 2022 from 884 in 2017. The type of cases has varied, with some plaintiffs challenging the lack of enforcement of climate-related laws. Other litigants are seeking to keep fossil fuels in the ground and hold corporations liable for damage to the environment.  The groups pursuing redress in the courts and tribunals are diverse. They include nations , like Antigua and Barbuda, mainly part of coalitions, such as the  . Cities, such as  , have also launched cases, as have civil society groups. One of those groups included Swiss seniors who   in the European Court of Human Rights that their health was threatened by heatwaves made worse by the climate crisis. Indigenous Peoples too, are increasingly going to court, arguing that the climate crisis is affecting their culture, their access to food and water, and ultimately their lives.   The raft of cases comes with the climate crisis deepening and the world   greenhouse emissions in line with the  , negotiated under the UNFCCC.  Does this rise in climate cases showcase the fact that international climate diplomacy is failing, as some have suggested?  “I think the argument that the pursuit of this sort of litigation will undermine the UNFCCC process is a red herring,” Phillips says. “I think both are necessary to achieve the goals we need because no state alone can solve climate change.”   This is echoed by UNEP’s Raine. “It is too early to say multilateral diplomacy has failed but it is true that it is not succeeding fast enough,” he says.  “A lot of climate litigation we have seen focuses on seeking to address government responses that are inadequate to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.”  Environmental law has been strengthened in recent years, with   the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. Meanwhile, environmental courts and tribunals in at least 67 countries have opened their doors to foreign plaintiffs, which have allowed local companies to be sued for their environmental transgressions abroad.  Raine says climate litigation is becoming an increasingly powerful tool. He mentions a number of successful climate litigation cases, including   questioning the constitutionality of Mexican policies that would limit renewable energy. The organization argued that this would effectively prevent Mexico from meeting its emissions reductions targets.   In other  , Brazil’s Supreme Court recognized  the Paris Agreement as a human rights treaty, which enjoys “supranational” status, placing it above national laws. A Dutch court ordered oil and gas company Shell to comply with the Paris Agreement and reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. And the UN Human Rights Committee   that Australia’s government is in violation of its human rights obligations to Torres Strait Islanders by not doing enough to slow climate change, the first ruling of its kind. Later this year, advisory opinions are set to be delivered by the   and the   in the case backed by Antigua and Barbuda. For Phillips, the outcome of the latter case will be key, which is taking a broad look at “the scope of international law” and the responsibilities countries have to address climate change.   Phillips says island nations, like Antigua and Barbuda, are suffering deeply from climate change. He believes courtroom victories will help them push for more concrete action on the crisis during negotiations with other countries.  “Ultimately, the right support from these international tribunals and courts will allow us to say ‘the [status quo] is wrong.'”      © 2024 UNEP            "},

UNEP’s sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6) is the most comprehensive report on the global environment since 2012. It shows that the overall environmental situation globally is deteriorating and the window for action is closing. 2. GEO-6 shows that a healthy environment is both a prerequisite and a foundation for economic prosperity, human health and wellbeing. It addresses the main challenge of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: that no one should be left behind, and that all should live healthy, fulfilling lives for the full benefit of all, for both present and future generations. 3. Unsustainable production and consumption patterns and trends and inequality, when combined with increases in the use of resources that are driven by population growth, put at risk the healthy planet needed to attain sustainable development. Those trends are leading to a deterioration in planetary health at unprecedented rates, with increasingly serious consequences, in particular for poorer people and regions. 4. Furthermore, the world is not on track to achieve the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals or other internationally-agreed environmental goals by 2030; nor is it on track to deliver long-term sustainability by 2050. Urgent action and strengthened international cooperation are urgently needed to reverse those negative trends and restore planetary and human health. 5. Past and present greenhouse gas emissions have already committed the world to an extended period of climate change with multiple and increasing environmental and society-wide risks. The sixth Global Environment Outlook, or GEO-6, is the world’s most comprehensive environmental report, covering a range of topics, issues and potential solutions. At present, the world is not on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. UNEP's GEO-6 calls for policy interventions that address entire systems in order to lead to healthy lives for all people. \n            Nairobi, Kenya, 13 March, 2019 –&nbsp;The most&nbsp;comprehensive and&nbsp;rigorous assessment on the state of the environment completed by the UN in the last five years was published today, warning that damage to the planet is so dire that people’s health will be increasingly threatened unless urgent action is taken.\nThe report, which was produced by 250 scientists and experts from… UN Environment’s Sixth Global Environmental Outlook (GEO-6) is the most comprehensive assessment of the state of the world's environment. The report also offers a rigorous analysis of our prospects for a healthy future. We’ve made progress, but we have a long way to go.

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has issued a   reviewers from around the world, and ensure the report presents robust science and peer-reviewed evidence and data.   This will be the  , since 1995. The series has become a go-to scientific resource for policymakers, providing them with peer-reviewed data and evidence-based analysis on everything from pollution to climate change.    GEO-7 is produced by hundreds of experts from around the world under the stewardship of UNEP.

Its long-term goal is to help humanity live more sustainably.    Putting together such a wide-ranging report is an immense undertaking and the GEO-7 drafting process has not been without its fair share of challenges. One has been enlisting the expertise of reviewers from around the globe.     We recently sat down with Nyovani Madise, the GEO-7 co-chair and a director at the African Institute for Development Policy, to discuss the importance of GEO-7 and the vital role that reviewers play in the drafting process.      This is a truly global assessment of the state of the environment. It takes stock of where we are now and how the triple planetary crisis of  ,  , and   are impacting our lives, our livelihoods and the world’s ability to achieve the  . When we look at where things are, especially with respect to the triple planetary crisis, we are not where we should be. And more worryingly, we are not moving in the right direction if we want to live in peace with nature.      GEO-7 will be a solution-focused report. It will say to governments and policymakers: here are the range of options that you can adopt to achieve agreed targets as well as socio-economic goals. Yes, we need more energy. Yes, we need more development. Yes, we need more natural resources. But here are ways we can provide all those more efficiently and more sustainably, and not at the expense of nature and not by continuing business as usual, which is how we got ourselves into this mess.       What is taking place in Nairobi is the third writers’ workshop where they are working not only on their respective chapters but also working together. They are discussing and responding to the comments and questions from a first set of reviewers. The same way that the environmental crises facing us are interdependent, the report will be made up of chapters that are interconnected, so that the solutions the report proposes will be holistic.       It takes time and a great deal of effort to bring together this team of more than 250 scientists and experts to author one document that is innovative and solutions-oriented. Another big challenge has been the availability of new and fresh empirical research. We are using existing models that need to be updated.       Right now, we need more expert reviewers from around the world that can ask: “Is this document scientifically sound? Does this resonate with me given what I know about this subject?” The more diverse the pool of reviewers, the better the report will be.     I would like to encourage scientists, especially women and those who are in universities and think tanks in the Global South, to heed our call for reviewers and participate. As the co-chair of GEO-7 and as a scientist, the reason why I accepted to be part of this process is because I wanted to know that there is representation from my part of the world.      The document is advocating for specific solutions and the reviewers will tell us if the solutions being proposed will work in their specific contexts. That evidence is important because we can incorporate it into the final report. If we are going to encourage policymakers to adopt a set of solutions, they need the assurance that the science is robust and peer-reviewed.      © 2024 UNEP            "},

Lake Mead, in Nevada and Arizona, and Lake Powell, in Utah and Arizona,  . ‘Dead pool’ status would mean the water level in the dams was so low it could no longer flow downstream and power hydroelectric power stations. The Lake Mead reservoir, which is the largest artificial body of water in America, was created in the 1930s by the construction of the Hoover Dam, an engineering masterpiece. Lake Powell, the second largest, was created in the 1960s with the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam. “The conditions in the American west, which we're seeing around the Colorado River basin, have been so dry for more than 20 years that we're no longer speaking of a drought,” said Lis Mullin Bernhardt, an ecosystems expert at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “We refer to it as “aridification” – a new very dry normal.” Lake Mead and Lake Powell not only provide water and electricity to tens of millions in Nevada, Arizona, California, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and Mexico, but they also provide irrigation water for agriculture. Experts warn that as the crisis deepens, water cuts will need to be introduced, but this may not be enough. “While regulating and managing water supply and demand are essential in both the short and long term, climate change is at the heart of this issue,” said Maria Morgado, UNEP’s Ecosystems Officer in North America. “In the long term, we need to address the root causes of climate change as well as water demands.” Over the past 20 years,   were caused by floods, droughts and other water-related events. With more frequent droughts, people in water-scarce areas will increasingly depend on groundwater because of its buffer capacity and resilience to climate variability. Increases in water demand due to growing populations and irrigation for agriculture have been compounded by climate change impacts such as reductions in precipitation and temperature rises. A rise in temperature leads to increased evaporation of surface water and baking of the earth, decreasing soil moisture. This is part of a wider trend affecting hundreds of millions of people across the planet. As climate change wreaks havoc on the Earth’s interconnected natural systems, drought and desertification are swiftly becoming the new normal, everywhere from the United States to Europe and Africa. , a 2022 report from the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, found that since 1970 weather, climate and water hazards have accounted for 50 per cent of all disasters and impact 55 million people globally every year. The report also found that 2.3 billion people face water stress annually.

When the 12-hour downpour finally eased in Nzove, a village perched on a hillside in north-eastern Burundi, Ntaciyica emerged from his home to find no crops or topsoil. All had been washed downhill by the deluge, and along with them, his livelihood.  “We had nothing left,” said Ntaciyica. “We were forced to sell our livestock. Our children couldn’t eat well. They went from two meals a day to one.” Along with most other men in the village, the father-of-six was forced to leave his wife and young children behind and travel to neighbouring Rwanda for work. The storm that ravaged Ntaciyica's village is part of a wave of extreme weather that has struck Burundi in recent years, a product of climate change, scientists say. Although the nation   greenhouse gas emissions per capita than almost any other country on Earth, it bears a disproportionately heavy burden from the climate crisis. The situation is only set to deteriorate. Temperatures are expected to rise between   in the country by 2050, while rainfall patterns are projected to become  , leading to protracted dry seasons, more flooding and increased erosion. This will put a mounting strain on agriculture, food security and access to safe water across the country. In the years to come, Burundi, like much of Africa, will face the monumental challenge of adapting to these changes. Countries will need solutions, like developing drought-resilient agriculture, building seawalls to protect coastal cities, improving water security to withstand droughts, and a whole lot more. Recent studies have predicted African countries on average, may have to spend up to   on climate adaptation than they do on healthcare. Yet the gap in financing for adaptation is both stark and widening. The estimated adaptation costs in the developing world are   than the finance currently provided. A United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) project funded by the Adaptation Fund is helping Ntaciyica and 2,000 farmers like him adopt   to less predictable weather in Burundi. In partnership with Burundi’s Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock, the project, called the Adapting to Climate Change in the Lake Victoria Basin initiative, has provided funding and training for farming cooperatives to plant 230,000 trees, including avocado and grevillea, to help prevent soil erosion. Not only do the trees absorb carbon, their roots keep the soil in place and their leaves provide shade from the equatorial sun, slowing evaporation and locking moisture in the soil. In this region, farmers tend to till the soil vertically along the slope, which makes the topsoil even more susceptible to erosion from increasingly extreme rainfall. To stop soil from sliding down the hillside, the project is helping farmers to construct terraces along the contours of 240 hectares of farmland and subsequently stabilizing the terraces by planting elephant grass along their fringes. The good news for Ntaciyica is that heavy rains no longer wash away his best soil. His harvests of beans and cassava have increased, his goats have extra food from the elephant grass and he has more money to invest in his children’s education. “The contours help us to prevent soil erosion and landslides,” he said, gazing up the hill at his farm. “Because the water remains in those contours, it keeps the land moist and we get better harvests. Where we used to harvest one sack, now we get two.” Having seen the positive results, Ntaciyica’s neighbours are now constructing their own terraces lined with soil-binding grasses. Further downhill, Lake Rweru fisher Ezechiel Bizimana blames increased erosion and landslides upstream on declining fish stocks. He has seen his catch gradually fall over his lifetime and says that the lake has already lost three species of fish. Climate change is making things worse, he says, as reduced rainfall has lowered the water level in the lake. “I started fishing when I was 10 years old,” Bizimana recalls. “We used to get 50kg a day, but now we rarely get more than 25kg.” Nutrient-rich soil particles carried by floods from deforested upland areas can upset lake ecosystems, lowering the oxygen level in the water. The silt also clogs fish gills and spoils spawning grounds. In parts of the lake near where the terraces have been constructed, Bizimana said he has observed an improvement in water quality, hinting at a potential reversal in fortunes for the depleted fish stocks. Like the farmers, Bizimana and around 30 other fishers have received support from the project. They are among some of the first in East Africa to try out a new fish-drying kiln constructed by the project, which creates a better-tasting, longer-lasting smoked fish. Not only does less fish go to waste but the end product can fetch a 50 per cent mark-up at the market. Crucially, the dryer uses almost 97 per cent less firewood than traditional smokers, reducing deforestation and providing further protection for the lake’s ecosystem. As Ntaciyica’s and Bizimana’s experiences show, protecting and harnessing nature upstream pays dividends for people downstream. In all, the livelihoods of 45 million people across Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya rely on the natural resources of the Lake Victoria Basin, which climate change is putting under ever-greater pressure. The UNEP-supported project in Nzove is building the capacity of the five governments to establish a regional framework to guide adaptation actions and provide a platform for countries to share best practices. Regional policy frameworks, informed by experiences on the ground, are vital for adapting to transboundary climate impacts, say those involved. “The project is demonstrating how small steps taken on the ground, underpinned by a coherent adaptation strategy, can significantly enhance people’s lives and livelihoods,” says Jessica Troni, Head of UNEP’s Climate Change Adaptation Unit. “Scaling-up such initiatives across the five countries that rely on the Lake Victoria Basin ecosystem has the potential to help millions of farmers and fishermen become more resilient to climate change.”     © 2024 UNEP            "},

As the sun rises, thousands of commuters jostle for space on public minibuses. Others hop on the city’s light rail line, the first network of its kind in Africa. Notably absent are bicycles; cyclists are not something seen regularly on these streets. Ephrem Bekele Woldeyesus wants to change that. The 34-year-old co-founded a community organization, Along the Way, that aims to make cycling common in the capital, in part to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the climate crisis. “It’s good for the environment and people’s health,” Woldeyesus said of cycling. “But here, people think it’s not safe. There are too many cars.” Woldeyesus is among a growing number of campaigners and government officials who want to make cycling and walking safer in Africa’s cities, where roads are notoriously dangerous. They believe that will lead more people to choose what’s known as active mobility, reducing gridlock and helping to counter a climate crisis that is already   on the continent of 1.3 billion. “Walking and cycling has huge benefits for people and the planet, improving health, reducing our carbon footprint and improving air quality.” Urban transport will be a focus of  , taking place from 4-8 September in Nairobi, Kenya. The annual event, which will feature policymakers from across the continent, is designed to help African states navigate the climate crisis, including by cutting their greenhouse gas emissions. The region, though, is   contributors to climate change. In many ways, Ethiopia has become a model for the environmental potential of active mobility. The country, with support from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), has launched an ambitious effort to convince citizens to keep walking and to take up cycling while steering clear of soot-spewing vehicles. The centrepiece of the push is the country’s Non-Motorized Transport Strategy. Launched in 2020, it sets several 10-year targets, including the construction of 3km of footpaths and 2km of bike paths per 10,000 people. It also aims to keep the number of kilometers travelled by private motor vehicle to 2020 levels and reduce fatalities of pedestrians and cyclists by 80 percent below 2019 levels.  That is considered crucial for encouraging people to take the two-wheel plunge. In Ethiopia, there are around  , according to the World Health Organization. The fatality figure is considered high given that there are only 1.1 million cars for a population of 99 million. Along with the active mobility strategy, Ethiopia has also launched road safety and transport plans while forging a partnership with the private sector to improve walking and cycling infrastructure. “Cycling is beneficial because it is environmentally friendly, economical and has health benefits,” said Fetiya Dedegeba, Deputy Executive Director of the Ethiopian Road Safety and Insurance Fund.   The active mobility movement is spreading across Africa. In Nairobi, all new roads are built with a footpath and a bike path. Twenty per cent of the Nairobi city transport budget is dedicated to active mobility, a policy UNEP has helped push.  Rwanda has introduced fortnightly car-free days where roads are turned over to walkers, joggers, roller skaters and cyclists. Guraride, an app that allows users to rent bikes and electric-powered two wheelers, has also been introduced. As well, the country, with the help of UNEP, developed a   that calls for all new roads to be built with traffic calming measures and adequate sidewalks, making them safer for cyclists and pedestrians.  Across much of Africa, though, roads remain perilous. The continent is home to   of global road traffic deaths, despite only having 3 per cent of the world’s registered vehicles. An average of 260 pedestrians and 18 cyclists are killed in Africa every day. That is largely due to a lack of infrastructure, poor urban planning and bad driving. Experts believe tackling those safety concerns could lead to a flowering of active mobility across the continent, something that would bring with it a range of benefits. “Walking and cycling have huge benefits for people and the planet, improving health, reducing our carbon footprint and improving air quality,” said Rob de Jong, head of UNEP’s mobility unit. A UNEP   found that a person who cycled instead of taking five short car trips a week would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they are responsible for by 86kg a year. The move away from cars and minibuses, many of which are  , would also help to reduce other types of airborne contaminants, said de Jong. “Many of these vehicles emit 10 times what they should,” said de Jong, who added that in many African countries automobile numbers double every decade. “Motor vehicle ownership is rapidly increasing so this is something we need to be critically aware of.” In Ethiopia, Seble Samuel, a cycling advocate, set up a campaign called Streets for the People, which, on the last Sunday of each month, sees thoroughfares closed to cars. On those days, the streets take on a party feel as hundreds of cyclists are joined by skateboarders, rollerbladers, joggers and families picnicking. The movement started in Addis Ababa but has now spread to other Ethiopian cities, such as Jimma Mekelle and Bahir Dar. “I’d lived in South America and seen how open street days could bring communities together,” said Samuel. “In Ethiopia, cycling is seen as something poor people do. If we lift those barriers…. we can tackle air pollution while promoting healthy and sustainable transport.”  . © 2024 UNEP            "},

The LEDs use around one-quarter the power of the library’s old setup and provide better illumination.   “We understand the importance of energy-efficient lighting both in terms of the environment and as a cost saving measure,” says Anwar Ejaz, the chief librarian.   The library lighting overhaul was part of a larger project supported by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the   and the Pakistan National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority. The effort encourages homeowners, companies and the private sector to switch from power-hungry incandescent bulbs and florescent lights to high-quality energy-efficient lighting products.  The transition could help save three power plants worth of energy by 2030. That is considered an important step for a country facing power shortages and aiming to reduce its emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.  “While energy efficiency seems like a relatively small thing to do, and it often gets overlooked, its impact can be huge,” says Paul Kellett, the team leader of UNEP’s   programme. “It has the potential to be a game changer.”  Kellett’s comments come just ahead of the first   on 26 January, which is showcasing how energy efficiency can help counter climate change. According to the International Energy Agency,   needed to achieve the targets of the  .   Pakistan relies on oil, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, coal, hydroelectricity and nuclear energy for its power. During summer, when demand for air-conditioning peaks, the country faces an  . This leads to rolling black outs, which limit economic growth and make life difficult for citizens.   The energy sector is the most significant contributor to the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. In 2018, Pakistan emitted   of carbon dioxide equivalent, nearly 45 per cent of which came from energy. By 2050 energy is expected to make up 64 per cent of total emissions in Pakistan.    is still without access to electricity. As people are connected to the power grid, demand will rapidly increase, making energy efficiency more important, say observers.   Alongside its work in energy efficiency, the Government of Pakistan has taken a number of steps to combat climate change. These include the   project. Launched in 2014, the project aims to turn 350,000 hectares of degraded land into forest, which will sequester over 148 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over the next 10 years. The government has also pledged to derive 60 per cent of its energy from renewable sources and said no new coal power plants will be built.   Along with the work at Raziuddin Siddiqi library, the UNEP-backed energy efficiency project supported the development of regulations to facilitate the national switch to energy-efficient lighting. The project also helped to strengthen national monitoring, verification and enforcement capacity and to roll out a country-wide LED lighting awareness campaign. The initiative is valued at US$7.4 million and received core funding from the Global Environment Facility. “The project is part of a far-reaching drive to bring more efficient lighting projects to Pakistan,” said Kellett.  By 2030, the transition to energy-efficient lighting in Pakistan could deliver 1.3 terawatt hours of annual electricity savings, the equivalent of three 100-megawatt power plants. That would spare building owners more than US$290 million in annual electricity costs. The embrace of efficient lighting could also prevent the release of nearly 1.2 megatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually, the equivalent of taking more than 630,000 cars off the road.   UNEP’s   has found that based on current government policies, the world is on track to warm by a potentially catastrophic 2.9°C by century’s end. The report found that to meet the goals of the   humanity needs to reduce greenhouse gases by unprecedented levels over the next seven years.   “Projects such as this are crucial in helping countries reach their climate pledges,” says Kellett. “We know we need to reduce emissions and projects such as this can show us how.”    © 2024 UNEP            "},

At least, it used to. A combination of climate change and deforestation is ravaging Xalapa’s protective tree cover. This is threatening water supplies for around 600,000 people and leaving Xalapa’s bare slopes vulnerable to landslides. Enter  , an initiative led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and funded by the  . It is helping Xalapa’s residents build a protective buffer of plants and trees high in the city’s hills. This defensive shield is being paired with the construction of rainwater harvesting tanks, which are helping residents to contend with a surge in droughts, another byproduct of the climate crisis.   “Xalapa is a paradox,” said Sergio Angón, National Project Coordinator for CityAdapt. Despite its 1,400mm of rainfall a year, he said, it still has water shortages. “This is the impact of climate change.” The type of work being done in Xalapa is known as climate change adaptation and was a focus of discussions last month in Panama, where leaders gathered for  . The event was a precursor to the  , also known as COP28, which takes place later this month in the United Arab Emirates. COP 28 comes with climate change’s impacts accelerating around the world. Government policies now in place could see the world   by century’s end, potentially setting off a cascade of extreme weather, including droughts, heatwaves and floods. Developing countries will need to spend up to US$387 billion annually to contend with the fallout, according to UNEP’s . They now have access to just a fraction of that total. That is one of the reasons the Xalapa effort, which relies on a combination of low-cost natural and built infrastructure, is considered so important. The capital of the state of Veracruz, the city gets nearly 38 per cent of its drinking water from the cloud forests that loom above it. But urban sprawl – Xalapa’s population has grown seven-fold in the last 30 years – is eating away at tree cover, said Angón. Experts say the cloud forest that surrounds Xalapa is one of the most endangered ecosystems in Mexico and is down to 1 per cent of its original coverage. Since 2017,   has been aiming to re-establish the balance between the forest and the city by protecting and restoring ecosystems.  The project produced an assessment of Xalapa’s vulnerabilities to climate change. That made clear the city’s greenbelt, which includes a hill named Estropajo and the Molinos de San Roque wetland, was vital to filtering water, increasing groundwater supplies and preventing floods. Project teams, in tandem with local government officials, have worked to revive the greenbelt, sowing more than 6,000 plants, including 3,900 trees. Many of those trees were given to local households, who were taught how to care for them. “We were delighted to work with UNEP on this project,” said Juan Carlos Contreras, Xalapa’s Secretary of the Environment. “In Xalapa, we are on the front line of the fight against climate change and nature-based solutions play a crucial role in protecting us.” Recognizing the greenery would take time to pay dividends, CityAdapt also helped build 12 rainwater harvesting systems in schools and public buildings. Designed to counter droughts, the systems provide more than 20,000 residents with a guaranteed supply of water. Their success led the municipality to install more than 100 other systems, the vast majority in homes, benefitting another 1,200 people. “Rainwater harvesting systems can be make or break for vulnerable climate-hit communities, and when combined with ecosystem restoration and protection, the results are even stronger,” says Jessica Troni, Head of UNEP’s Climate Change Adaptation Unit. The Universidad Veracruzana, one of Mexico’s top-ranked schools, teamed with UNEP to build three rainwater harvesting systems. The institution had long battled to provide students with water, sometimes being forced to truck it in. “During water shortages, Xalapa often only had enough municipal water for a few days per week,” said Laura Bello, who heads up the university’s sustainability group. “We’ve seen just how important low-cost adaptation solutions, like rainwater harvesting, can be for water security in cities.” Along with Xalapa, CityAdapt is working to support Kingston, Jamaica and San Salvador, El Salvador contend with the climate crisis. By pairing green infrastructure, like forests, with grey infrastructure, like water harvesting tanks, it is aiming to increase the climate resilience of close to 100,000 people. “With grey infrastructure the benefits can be more immediate, while green infrastructure is more holistic with added benefits, such as promoting biodiversity and urban amenities,” said Troni. “A combined grey-green approach takes the best of both worlds.”    and UNEP’s work with the Global Environment Facility on    © 2024 UNEP            "},

The key is to limit global warming to an average of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. So how do we get there? Here is a roadmap for six key sectors.", "content": "The world is warming faster than at any point in recorded history. This is radically changing the Earth’s climate and releasing a wave of extreme weather, including wildfires, hurricanes, floods and droughts. But humanity can still avoid the worst impacts of this climate crisis. To do that, we must prevent the Earth’s temperature from rising more than  1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The only way to avoid catastrophic climate change is to rapidly slash our emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.  These emissions, which come largely from burning fossil fuels, have continued to rise in recent decades despite a raft of international accords, including the Paris Agreement. To keep the 1.5°C temperature target alive, the world needs to cut 2030 emissions by 42 per cent. This must be done in tandem with climate adaptation. National Adaptation Plans in particular are crucial for ensuring climate resilience is built into each of the sectors.  A little math tells us that to reach that target, we need to reduce our annual emissions by 22 gigatonnes, or 22 billion tonnes of CO  equivalent. That might seem like a lot. But by focusing on key sectors, we can get there. By 2025, every country must commit to new National Determined Contributions (NDCs), these NDCs must cover all emissions and sectors. Global ambition in the next round of NDCs must bring global GHG emissions in 2035 to levels consistent with the 1.5°C pathway. Extrapolated from   and  data from  What are these sectors and how and many gigatonnes of emissions can we slash from each? This sector  is  responsible for about   and has an emission reduction potential of 13.6 gigatonnes annually, with agriculture accounting for 91 per cent of these emissions on average. Agriculture, forestry and other land-based industries (AFOLU) are major contributors to climate change. The world can reduce emissions by 7.3 gigatonnes annually if it halts deforestation, ecosystem degradation and restores ecosystems. These actions would also improve air quality, bolster food and water security and shore up rural economies. As well, they could be key contributors to reduce biodiversity loss. Most importantly, investments in land, freshwater and marine ecosystems can make a major contribution to increasing climate resilience (known as 'ecosystem-based adaptation'). The global energy supply system – which includes the production of electricity and heat – is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions, churning out 20 gigatonnes of CO2-eq per year. We can cut 12.6 gigatonnes of emissions annually from the sector by, in part, increasing renewable energy capacity and improving energy efficiency rate.  Equivalent to taking 7 billion passengers cars off the road. This transition could also create millions of jobs, improve air quality, save consumers on their electricity bills and expand electricity access to people around the world. Clean energy can also be vital for adapting to climate change. Utilising a diverse variety of renewable energy sources can buffer against potential disruptions from climate impacts, ensuring consistent energy supply. Greenhouse gas  emissions from the industry sector in 2019 reached   has the potential to reduce its emissions by   yearly. It can do this, in part, by electrifying production processes, embracing new fuels, develop innovation in high-emission sectors (steel, cement, aluminium), and decarbonizing oil and gas through methane abatement and carbon management technologies. Industries can increase their resilience to climate impacts by incorporating climate risk and projections into business plans and future investments. The global transport sector has the highest reliance on fossil fuels of any sector. It is responsible for  , which represents 15 per cent of the global total emissions. These emissions are set to double – growing faster than any other industry. Most of this growth will take place in the Global South - in countries which already today are suffering disproportionately from high petroleum fuel prices.  We could reduce emissions in the transport sector by 3.8 gigatonnes annually by switching to electric vehicles, more fully embracing public transit and better designing cities so that their citizens require less travel.  Shifting to locally generated low-carbon electricity instead of using imported petroleum fuels for motorised transport will reduce fuel import bills, increase energy security and add to local value creation. To build resilience, climate risk and vulnerability assessments should be incorporated into planning the design, construction and operation of transport infrastructure to withstand extreme weather conditions. The construction and operation of the world’s buildings is responsible for  . They are responsible for   and 37 per cent of energy and process-related carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions. The emissions reduction potential in buildings is   and 2 Gt for direct and indirect emissions (electricity and heat).  According to the IPCC, the building sector mitigation policies can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 90 per cent in developed countries and up to 80 per cent in developing countries, and help lift up to 2.8 billion people in developing countries out of energy poverty.  To decrease emissions in the building sector, we must minimize excess floor space, reduce energy intensity of buildings, reduce emissions intensity of energy use in buildings, and decrease emissions from construction, especially embodied carbon.  An integrated approach to both adaptation and mitigation in the sector is essential. Buildings designed with climate adaptation can also contribute to reduced energy consumption and thus mitigation. Fluorinated gases (F-gases) comprise of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), as well as nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). They cut across all sectors.  The United Nations Environment Programme works across sectors to support the transition to a low-carbon, more resilient future where we reduce emissions and ensure the sectors can also adapt to the climate impacts that are expected.

They’re going electric.  At a battery swapping station, drivers are quick to share their enthusiasm for their new e-motorcycles, replacements for the petrol-powered models they once rode.  “I can say there are four advantages or benefits to using an electric motorcycle,” says Aounon Yao, who recently switched from driving a combustion-powered motorcycle.  “Firstly, the electric motorcycle is half the price to run. Secondly, it doesn't explode in the event of an accident. Thirdly, it reduces noise and air pollution. And fourthly, it is healthy to ride.”  However, even with the clear benefits to switching to e-motorcycles, the transition away from the combustion engine has been slow across Africa.  There are an estimated   two- and three-wheelers on the road in Africa, corresponding to an estimated annual market value of US$4.8 billion. Less than 1 per cent of these vehicles are electric.  Most of the two- and three-wheelers are still using internal combustion engines and rely on fossil fuels. When burned, fossil fuels pollute the air and warm the planet.  The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the   (GEF) are assisting governments from 41 countries to accelerate the uptake of e-mobility as part of the  . The programme has been helping Togo move towards its   goals by supporting the development of a national e-mobility policy. The policy aims to put in place regulatory and fiscal mechanisms to make electric vehicles mainstream.  Mery Yaou, Director of the Environment at Togo’s  , says one of the government’s objectives is to make the country a regional leader in e-mobility.  “There are already almost 3,000 e-motorcycles on the road in Togo, so from Togo, I think the market will spread throughout the region,” says Yaou.  Research shows that shifting two- and three-wheelers to electric has the potential to reduce between   of carbon dioxide emissions every year.   However, in Africa, only approximately 20,000 electric motorcycles have been deployed across the continent, amounting to less than  .   The reason for this slow uptake is multifaceted.  Since the 1990s, two- and three-wheelers have exploded in popularity, primarily due to the failure of public transport services to serve the population in urban and rural areas.  The absence of financing for electric motorcycle importers has held back development, as has limited battery charging and swapping infrastructure.  Another need has been for the development and implementation of clear national strategies to promote, finance and scale-up low-carbon electric mobility.  The world must cut greenhouse gas emissions by   by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Fossil fuels, including oil, coal and gas, are responsible for nearly    of carbon dioxide emissions. Experts say there is a pressing need for a shift to alternative energy sources.    UNEP Director of the Industry and Economy Division Sheila Aggarwal-Khan says it is essential that low- and middle-income countries are part of a global shift to zero-emissions electric mobility – to meet the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement and to reduce air pollution.  “With two and three-wheelers playing an important role in local economies, Africa has the potential to leapfrog the conventional mobility pathway by moving directly to electric vehicles,” Aggarwal-Khan says. “Togo is showing how a combination of private sector initiative and government support can accelerate the introduction of e-mobility that meets local market needs, from the bottom up.”  Battery-powered transportation is cleaner than fossil-fuel-based transit, but it comes with its own costs. Lithium-ion batteries rely on the extraction of minerals—especially lithium and cobalt—while improper battery disposal can harm the environment.  Alongside work to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles in Togo and around the world, UNEP is ramping up efforts to develop a circular economy for electric vehicle batteries. By promoting innovative battery design and increasing recycling in the battery industry, countries can reduce the need for virgin raw materials.  Meanwhile, in Togo, the message is clear.  “Do your utmost to change your combustion motorcycle for an electric one,” electric motorbike driver Amegan Kpe Yao says. “Given that the environment is everything, we must not contribute to its degradation.”          © 2024 UNEP            "},

Set amid winding roads, green trees and stunning mountains, it has more than 1,000 pupils, most of whom hail from one of Panama’s largest indigenous groups, the Ngäbe. The single-storey school stands out from other buildings in the impoverished Hato Chami region because of the solar water heaters fitted to its roof. The recently installed devices allow students to take hot showers and make it easier for staff to boil water when preparing meals. “People think that because Panama is a hot country there is no need for hot water,” said Luis Navntoft, an advisor at  , a broad-based partnership that installed the solar water heaters. “They are often not aware about the need for heat, either for hot water or cooking.\" Termosolar is funded by the   and supported by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the National Secretariat of Energy, the Ministry of the Environment, Banco General, the Technological University of Panama and the Panama Green Building Council. Innovative Partnerships like Termosolar are expected to be a focus of discussions on 20 September as world leaders gather for the   in New York. Part of the UN General Assembly, the event is designed to help supercharge the global effort to both counter and adapt to the climate crisis. “People think that because Panama is a hot country there is no need for hot water. They are often not aware about the need for heat, either for hot water, cooking or conditioning.” Hato Chami is not unique in Latin America and the Caribbean. Many schools, hospitals and homes are without hot water. Electric water heaters are expensive and until recently solar was an untapped commodity. Many communities rely on firewood for heating – with the chopping of trees leading to deforestation. Globally, trees soak up 30 per cent of emissions from industry and fossil fuels, but every year 10 million hectares of forests are  , with deforestation accounting for 11 per cent of carbon emissions. Projects like Termosolar Panama can help keep trees in the ground.  “Hot water is one of the easiest things to make sustainable, through solar thermal,” said Geordie Colville, UNEP’s Chief of Energy and Climate. “But even in tropical countries, such as Panama, where the sun is plentiful, a large proportion of water is heated by non-sustainable means.” Alongside countering deforestation, solar hot water heating could also help Panama cut its reliance on fossil fuels, particularly liquefied petroleum gas. A driver of climate change, according to Termosolar Panama the fuel is used to heat most of the over 30 million litres of hot water Panamanians use daily. Termosolar Panama is part of a wider Panamanian effort to move away from fossil fuels. This includes a national strategy to deploy 1 million square meters of solar thermal technology throughout the country by 2050. When fully implemented, Panama’s National Solar Thermal Plan will prevent the release of 2.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and save Panamanians more than US$110 million annually on fossil fuel bills. “[Termosolar Panama] gives me an explosion of good feelings,” said Rosilena Lindo, the Deputy Secretary of Energy in Panama. “It is building a family around solar in Panama and really helping raise awareness and capacity.” Raising awareness was one of Termosolar Panama’s key objectives, as was carrying out pilot projects like the one at Hato Chami school. “We knew we had to raise awareness around solar,” said Jesús Gonzalez, project manager of Termosolar Panama. “There was no real understanding in Panama that fossil fuels were used to heat water, or the amount of hot water that could be produced. We also knew we needed to prove it worked, which is why pilot projects are so important.” Termosolar Panama has deployed 430 square metres of solar water heaters. Alongside Hato Chami school, they were installed in health facilities, including three large hospitals, hotels, factories, farms and homes. The project focused on developing local skills and supply chains. As a result, all installations were done by local workers. “It was important to us that the technology could be implemented by local suppliers,” said Gonzalez. “Not only [will that] create jobs but, more importantly, technology know-how has been developed locally, either for installing or manufacturing solar thermal systems.” At the Hato Chami school, the installation of solar water heaters was done together with  , a social purpose organization that began by using surfing to help at-risk children develop social, academic and physical skills. “Hot water is one of the easiest things to make sustainable, through solar thermal.” During the pandemic, Waved founder Bastian Barnbeck noticed the Hato Chami school kitchen was rundown and ill-equipped. Cooks were using large amounts of wood, which was bad for the environment, and heating water was ineffective and slow.   Waved set out to build a new kitchen and reached out to the Termosolar Panama project team. Termosolar decided that Waved’s community-led approach would make a good pilot project, and it donated and installed the equipment. “We listened to the community and their needs and designed something that worked for them,” said Barnbeck, “Not only was the new kitchen easier to use but it was better for the environment.” Barnbeck believes it is this community-led approach that has made Termosolar Panama a success, a sentiment echoed by Lindo, who helped launch the project and believes it has regional and international appeal.  The success of Termosolar Panama demonstrates the viability of solar thermal as an alternate fuel to help lower the  country’s dependence of liquefied petroleum gas. According to a  , replacing this fuel with renewable energy could create over 93,000 jobs in Panama by 2050, or 133,000 if part of the technology was built locally. If Panama switched to entirely renewable energy, carbon dioxide emissions could fall by 91 per cent by 2050, also reducing Panama’s energy costs by US$22 billion. Moving towards renewable energy, such as solar thermal, could bring the wider Latin America and Caribbean region a net benefit of US$1.3 billion by 2050, or about 20 per cent of the 2019 regional GDP.   “Termosolar Panama is helping bring thermal heating to the attention of Panamanians,” Colville said. “It is offering solutions that will help us reduce emissions and save money, but this project provides an example that can be replicated globally.”   © 2024 UNEP            "},

Experts say reversing that trend is vital to tamping down the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change. ", "content": "Every year, humanity clears   of forests, an area equivalent to the size of Portugal.   The loss of these ecosystems is devastating for   and the   who rely on forests for food, water and other essentials.  But deforestation has another, often-overlooked peril: it is stoking climate change. The felling of trees in tropical areas alone releases more than   of planet-warming greenhouse gasses every year. That is more than four times the combined total of aviation and shipping.  As countries prepare to update their national climate pledges in 2025, a key part of the landmark   on climate change, experts are urging them to include concrete targets to end deforestation and restore forests. Without those provisions, experts say, countries will be hard pressed to rein in a climate crisis that is   and unleashing   of   around the world.  “Not only do forests support rich biodiversity and provide for human societies and economies but they play a vital role in stabilizing our climate,” says Mirey Atallah, head of the Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience branch of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “If we are to have any hope of slowing climate change, we must halt deforestation.”  Here is a closer look at how forests can counter the climate crisis.    Trees are some of the planet’s most important warehouses of carbon, absorbing the element from the air via photosynthesis, and storing it in their leaves, roots and trunks.   But when trees decay or are burned, they release stored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. This is a greenhouse gas that traps heat near the Earth’s surface, raising temperatures and propelling climate change.   At the same time, the loss of trees means forests are no longer able to absorb as much carbon from the air as before, a double hit for the climate.    Human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, are pushing greenhouse gas emissions to  , sparking climatic upheaval, including flooding, droughts and wildfires. These catastrophes   and cause trillions of dollars in economic losses each year.   And they are poised to get worse. UNEP data shows that based on current national commitments, the planet   this century, well above the goals of the Paris Agreement and enough to trigger widespread  .   Cutting emissions quickly by saving and restoring forests is considered vital.     A big one. To keep global warming below 1.5°C, a key goal of the Paris Agreement, the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions by   annually by 2030. Halting deforestation could reduce emissions by  , according to the  , a partnership between UNEP, the UN Development Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. Protecting and restoring forests is one of many nature-based solutions that countries can use to limit greenhouse gas emissions.   found these strategies could help cut emissions anywhere from 10 gigatonnes to 18 gigatonnes a year by 2050.    No. Driven   by the expansion of agriculture, deforestation continues at a breakneck pace. The world has lost   of forests since 1990, found the Food and Agriculture Organization. That is an area about half the size of China. From 2015-2020, the rate of deforestation was 10 million hectares a year, an area about the size of Portugal.    All 195 signatories of the   climate treaty adopted in 2015 must submit Nationally Determined Contributions. These climate plans outline how countries are going to reduce emissions and can include everything from investments in renewable energy to the promotion of more sustainable farming practices.  Despite the climate-change-fighting ability of forests, only 40 per cent of the most deforestation-prone countries have measures to protect forests in their nationally determined contributions, found a  .  With a new round of pledges due in 2025, Atallah says this is a “golden opportunity” for policymakers to incorporate concrete targets for protecting and restoring forests.     The first step is to set clearly defined targets for stopping deforestation and restoring forests within nationally determined contributions, says Atallah. The often-complex drivers of deforestation, including resource extraction and the unchecked expansion of agriculture, will require national dialogues and trade-offs.   National climate plans should also consider the diverse perspectives of Indigenous Peoples, rural communities, women and young people, found the UN-REDD report. Developing countries, which are home to the vast majority of deforestation, also need technical and financial support to live up to their commitments to protect forests.  UNEP is working with countries to ensure that payments for forests, be those from the development community or from carbon markets, reflect the true value of forest ecosystems and provide a meaningful funding flow to developing countries. According to a  , forest carbon prices should rapidly climb to US$30-US$50 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to have impact. Currently, they are at or below US$10 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is by any measure, way less than it costs to maintain forests.  “We are running out of time to tackle the climate crisis,” says Atallah. “If countries do not make real progress in protecting forests and cutting emissions with this round of nationally determined contributions, it may be too late to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.”          © 2024 UNEP            "},

REDD+ is a climate change mitigation solution developed by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Its framework, the so-called Warsaw Framework was adopted in 2013 at COP 19 in Warsaw and provides the methodological and financing guidance for the implementation of REDD+ activities. The Paris Climate Agreement recognizes REDD+ and the central role of forests in Article 5. REDD+ reduces deforestation through the conservation and sustainable management of forests and supporting developing countries in turning their political commitments, as represented in their Nationally Determined Contributions, into action on the ground. Forests mitigate climate change because of their capacity to remove carbon from the atmosphere and to store it in biomass and soils. When forests are cleared or degraded, they can become a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by releasing that stored carbon. It is estimated that globally, deforestation and forest degradation account for around 11 percent of CO2 emissions. To date, 118 countries have included forest and land use in their Nationally Determined Contributions pledges. This represents 162 million hectares of restored, reforested and afforested land, which is in line with the Bonn Challenge and the New York Declaration on Forests. Since 2008 the UN-REDD Programme (UNEP, FAO and UNDP) has been supporting 65 partner countries in their nationally led efforts to become “REDD+ ready” and qualify for results-based payments. As of today, UN-REDD countries have submitted forest emissions reductions equal to taking 150 million cars off the road for a year. And UN-REDD has channeled and mobilized more than USD 1 billion since inception. Within the UN-REDD Programme, UNEP leads on private sector engagement, safeguards, knowledge management and communications. Key facts  During 2015–2020, the rate of deforestation was estimated at 10 million hectares per year. Currently 11% of all carbon emissions stem from deforestation – more than emissions from all means of transport combined. Limiting climate change to well below 2C cannot be achieved without REDD+. Halting deforestation and forest degradation can avoid emissions of more than 5 gigatons CO2e/year. Forest conservation and restoration can provide more than one quarter of the emissions reductions needed in the next two decades. The goals of the Paris Agreement cannot be met without the world's forests: their mitigation potential by 2030 is about 5 gigatons/year, on par with that of industry and only behind the energy sector. Forests, however, are more than that. Protecting the world's forests is crucial to meet the Sustainable Development Goals: they provide an array of critically important ecosystem services including habitat for biodiversity of global significance and livelihoods for vulnerable and indigenous communities. Forests and woodlands are important stores of planet-warming carbon dioxide, soaking up 30 per cent of emissions from industry and fossil fuels. But every year, the world loses 10 million hectares of forests, an area larger than Portugal. Deforestation and forest degradation account for approximately 11 percent of carbon emissions. If deforestation were a country, it would rank third in carbon dioxide emissions behind China and the United States of America. An annual outlay of $1 million in forest management can generate from 500 to 1,000 jobs in many developing countries, and 20 to 100 in most developed and middle-income countries. Investments in forests can become a backbone for COVID-19 recovery efforts in rural economies in developing countries.

The difference between these two values is known as the ‘emissions gap’. In line with previous editions, the report highlights key opportunities to bridge this gap. This edition of the report presents an overview of options for enhancing the ambition of NDCs, while strengthening actions through a suite of domestic policies tackling climate change. Next to the role of governments it also assesses the role of non-state and subnational actors in bridging the emissions gap, examines the role of fiscal policy reform in creating incentives for low carbon investments and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and assesses how acceleration of innovative approaches can help bridge the emissions gap, while simultaneously transforming societies. The Emissions Gap Report 2018 finds that it is still possible to keep global warming below 2°C, but the technical feasibility of bridging the 1.5°C gap is dwindling.

More than 2,500 delegates participated in INC-4, representing 170 Members and over 480 Observer organizations including - non-governmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, and UN entities. INC-4 marked the Committee's largest and most inclusive gathering to date, with Observer participation increasing by almost fifty per cent. Over the course of INC-4,   worked on negotiating the   of the international legally binding instrument. Delegates discussed, among other things: emissions and releases; production; product design; waste management; problematic and avoidable plastics; financing, and a just transition. INC Members also agreed on intersessional work – expert meetings that take place between the official INC sessions – that is expected to catalyze convergence on key issues. In addition, Members decided to create an Open-ended Legal Drafting Group to form at INC-5, serving in an advisory capacity by reviewing elements of the draft revised text to ensure legal soundness. “We came to Ottawa to advance the text and with the hope that Members would agree on the intersessional work required to make even greater progress ahead of INC-5. We leave Ottawa having achieved both goals and a clear path to landing an ambitious deal in Busan ahead of us,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). “The work, however, is far from over. The plastic pollution crisis continues to engulf the world and we have just a few months left before the end of year deadline agreed upon in 2022. I urge members to show continued commitment and flexibility to achieve maximum ambition.” The fourth session follows INC-1 in Punta del Este in November 2022, INC-2 in Paris in May/June 2023, and INC-3 in Nairobi in November 2023. INC-5 – set to be the end of the INC process – is scheduled for November 2024 in Busan, the Republic of Korea. “Canada is committed to reaching a final agreement at INC-5 in the Republic of Korea before year end. We are no longer talking about “if” we can get there, but “how.” Together we can land one of the most significant environmental decisions since the Paris Agreement and the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework,” said said Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “We are doing everything we can to raise the international profile of the plastic pollution crisis so that the agreement gets the global attention it deserves to cross the finish line.” The Chair of the INC, Ambassador Luis Vayas said: “During these seven days of intense deliberations, you – the delegates – have managed to build on and advance the revised draft text of the instrument, providing streamlined text and entering textual negotiations on several elements,” Ambassador Vayas said. “At the same time, we also leave with a much clearer picture of the work that remains to be done, if we are to deliver on the promise that Members have made through UNEA Resolution 5/14.”   “We are all united by our strong shared commitment to deliver an international legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution. It is this spirit of multilateralism which has guided our discussions here in Ottawa,” he added. “We have found some common ground, and we are walking this path together until the end. I firmly believe that we can carry this same spirit forth to Busan to deliver on our mandate.” Ambassador Vayas thanked the Government of Canada for hosting the session, as well as the Committee Members, Observers, co-facilitators, support staff, and the INC Secretariat, and his team. “It has been an ambitious timeline of just 18 months and four sessions to get us to this point, and we are now firmly on the road to Busan. Compromise and commitment remains strong at this advanced stage of the negotiations,” said Jyoti Mathur-Filipp, Executive Secretary of the INC Secretariat. “Members should arrive in Busan ready to deliver on their mandate and agree a final text of the instrument. This is more than a process – it is the fulfilment of your commitment to saving future generations from the global scourge of plastic pollution.” United Nations Environment Assembly   requested the Executive Director of UNEP to convene an intergovernmental negotiating committee, to begin its work during the second half of 2022, with the ambition of completing its work by the end of 2024. The INC is tasked with developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, henceforth referred to as “the instrument”, which could include both binding and voluntary approaches, based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic.   – The fourth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment (INC-4), opened today in Canada’s capital, Ottawa. The session aims to advance negotiations so that the Committee can finalize, at its   in November, the text of the instrument. Members will also decide on intersessional work – informal INC sessions taking place between the official meetings – required between the INC-4 and INC-5, to support the further development of the text. INC-4 is the penultimate stage of the negotiations; it follows three earlier rounds of negotiations: INC-1, which took place in Punta del Este, in November 2022, INC-2, which was held in Paris in June 2023, and INC-3, which happened in Nairobi in November 2023. “We are seeing convergence on eliminating the uses that are problematic and avoidable. We will continue to need plastic for specific uses, such as renewable energy technologies. But there is growing agreement that short-lived and single use can go,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme. “We can be proud of what we have achieved. But a job half-done is a job not done. Time is against us – both in terms of finalizing the instrument and how much more the planet can take. As we deliberate, plastic pollution continues to gush into ecosystems,” she added. “So, I ask for INC-4 to show energy, commitment, collaboration, and ambition. To make progress. And set the stage for INC-5 to finalize an instrument that will end plastic pollution, once and for all.” INC-5, to be held in Busan, the Republic of Korea, from 25 November to 1 December 2024, is intended as the end of the INC process. It will be followed by a Diplomatic Conference where Heads of State will sign the agreement. “We are here seeking to advance these negotiations and deliver a treaty because collectively we have recognized that multilateral cooperation – this INC process, a new legally binding international instrument – have a critical role to play in providing the effective and impactful solutions needed to end plastic pollution. The spirit of multilateralism is: “together, we are stronger”,” said Luis Vayas Valdivieso, Chair of the INC. “Let us negotiate with accountability and integrity –grounded in the scientific evidence and facts on the scale and urgency of ending plastic pollution. Let us also approach this task with optimism, that it is both necessary and possible for us to achieve this new treaty,” he added. The start of INC-4 was preceded by regional consultations and a conversation with Observers, and Canada hosted a Partnerships Day and a Ministerial Day on the sidelines of the session. “Agreeing to a global agreement on plastic pollution by the end of 2024 would mark one of the most significant environmental decisions and would be a first-of-its-kind agreement to unite the world around a shared goal to end plastic pollution,” said Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “Canada has put in place a number of measures to stem the tide of plastic pollution at home, and we are keen to keep up the momentum for a global agreement that aligns with our ambition. We welcome delegations, partners, and stakeholders from around the world to Ottawa for INC-4 to continue the ambitious work needed to achieve this united goal.” At the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly in February 2024, Canada convened the other host countries of the INC process – France, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, and Uruguay – for a Ministerial meeting, under the umbrella of the Host Country Alliance, to galvanize momentum toward the global instrument. “Seize this opportunity, make these seven days count, deliver a text that is as close as possible to the final agreement that we all want to see,” said Jyoti Mathur- Filipp, Executive Secretary of the INC. “You delegates know the issues that need to be addressed at this session, and that flexibility will be needed to reach consensus.

The third session follows INC-1 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in November 2022 and INC-2 in Paris, France, in May/June 2023. Over the course of INC-3, Members discussed the Chair’s Zero Draft, went through a compilation of text to include all the views of Members, prepared a validated, co-facilitator merged text, and found a way forward on issues not discussed as yet. The INC also elected two Vice-Chairs to the Bureau and a new Chair of the Committee, Ambassador Luis Valdivieso of Ecuador. As indicated at INC-1, H.E. Mr. Gustavo Adolfo Meza-Cuadra Velasquez stepped down from the position as the Chair of the committee at the end of INC-3; Ambassador Luis Vayas Valdivieso of Ecuador was elected by acclamation as INC Chair moving forward. “I am encouraged by the forward motion of the negotiations towards a treaty that ends plastic pollution. I thank the Chair, Ambassador Meza-Cuadra, and the Members of the INC for their determination to get to the finish line and put us on course for a world where plastic pollution is a problem of the past,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). “Continue to be ambitious, innovative, inclusive, and bold. And use these negotiations to hone a sharp and effective instrument that we can use to carve out a better future, free from plastic pollution.\"     Officially closing the session, outgoing Chair of the INC, H.E. Mr. Gustavo Adolfo Meza-Cuadra Velasquez, thanked the Government of Kenya and the UN in Nairobi for hosting the session, as well as the Member States, observers, co-facilitators and support staff of the discussions.   “These past 10 days have been a significant step forward towards the achievement of our objective to develop an international legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution. But it has also recalled us that much remains to be done both in narrowing down our differences and in developing technical work to inform our negotiations,” he said. Quoting Nelson Mandela, he added: “I invite all of you to reflect on as we engage in the upcoming INCs: Sometimes, it falls upon a generation to be great. You can be that great generation. Let your greatness blossom.\" “I urge all of us to listen to the scientific community and the diversity of stakeholders that can and do bring evidence, experience, and knowledge to these negotiations. Their work is evolving and developing every day,” said incoming INC Chair, Ambassador Luis Vayas. “I thank Ambassador Meza-Cuadra for his steady leadership of the process up to this midway point and will do my utmost to work with Members and all stakeholders for the success of the INC process, delivery of the instrument and implementation to end plastic pollution, protecting human health and the environment.  INC Members also agreed on the dates of both INC-4, to take place in Ottawa, Canada, in April 2024, and INC-5, which is scheduled for November/December 2024 in the Republic of Korea. I am pleased to see that the Nairobi spirit of collaboration, compromise and commitment has been in full force during our session in the city that birthed the INC process. We saw this during our Preparatory Meeting on 11 November, which set the stage for the positive momentum we achieved at this session, and in the constructive and cooperative manner in which you all engaged throughout this week,” said Jyoti Mathur-Filipp, Executive Secretary of the INC Secretariat.  “Let us carry the Nairobi spirit of collaboration, compromise and commitment forward into our next sessions, as we continue on our journey towards a strong, ambitious and inclusive instrument to combat plastic pollution,” she added.

INC-3 members will start negotiations on the basis of the Zero Draft text prepared by the Chair of the INC.  INC-3 marks the mid-point of the journey towards a global treaty. It follows two earlier rounds of negotiations: INC-1, which took place in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in November 2022, and INC-2, which was held in Paris in June. Two more INC sessions are planned for 2024.  “To deal with plastic pollution, humanity must change. We must change the way we consume, the way we produce and how we dispose our waste. This is the reality of our world. Change is inevitable. This treaty, this instrument that we are working on, is the first domino in this change. Let us bring it home. Let the change begin,” Kenyan President William Ruto said at the opening of the session.   In her remarks at the opening of INC-3, the Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), Inger Andersen, said: “The resolution passed at UNEA 5.2 (the fifth United Nations Environment Assembly in 2022) called for an instrument that is, and I quote, ‘based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic.”  “Not an instrument that deals with plastic pollution by recycling or waste management alone. The full life cycle. This means rethinking everything along the chain, from polymer to pollution, from product to packaging,” she added. “We need to use fewer virgin materials, less plastic and no harmful chemicals. We need to ensure that we use, reuse, and recycle resources more efficiently. And dispose safely of what is left over. And use these negotiations to hone a sharp and incisive instrument to carve out a better future, free from plastic pollution.”  “We now have had the opportunity to have the first round of discussion on all elements of the future instrument,” Chair of the INC, Gustavo Adolfo Meza-Cuadra Velasquez, said.  “It is my hope that by the end of the session, the Committee will agree on a mandate for a revised draft and possible intersessional work to prepare for that fourth and fifth sessions,” he added. “I am confident that we can make substantive progress here at our third session and capitalise on the Nairobi spirit, consensus and ambition.”  The start of INC-3 was preceded by a   on 11 November, also in Nairobi, during which delegates engaged in initial, informal exchanges of views, as well as regional consultations on 12 November.

The world is calling for an agreement that is broad, innovative, inclusive and transparent, one that leans on science and learns from stakeholders, and one that ensures support for developing nations.\" “Plastic has been the default option in design for too long. It is time to redesign products to use less plastic, particularly unnecessary and problematic plastics, to redesign product packaging and shipping to use less plastic, to redesign systems and products for reuse and recyclability and to redesign the broader system for justice,” she added. “The INC has the power to deliver this transformation, bringing major opportunities for everyone.” On the first day of the session, Member States elected Georgia, Estonia, Sweden and the US to the Bureau.

Important that we find our way towards an ambitious multilateral instrument that ensures plastic products are circulated in practice, not just in theory.” She went on to emphasize: “To get this done, the deal must cover the full life cycle: from considering different types of polymers and plastic products to developing safe and environmentally sound waste management. Crucially, we must ensure that these actions take into account the principles of a just transition so that nobody is left behind.” Several delegates indicated the instrument should take a combined approach with legally binding core obligations, control measures and voluntary elements to address the entire plastics lifecycle. Furthermore, many delegates emphasized the need to ensure strong monitoring and reporting mechanisms as part of the success of the future instrument. In summarizing the discussions, INC Chair Ambassador Gustavo Meza-Cuadra (Peru) stated: “‘It is clear that we have started to see areas of convergence in the development of the future instrument.” Jyoti Mathur-Filipp, INC Secretariat Executive Secretary, indicated that the outcome of the first session is a mandate that is deeply crucial in moving towards developing a draft text for the instrument within two years.  She stressed the need for an ambitious and meaningful outcome of the INC process. The deliberations were preceded by a  which opened on 26 November with around 900 participants taking place in person and online.  that plastics are one of the biggest examples of unsustainable consumption and production, of “use and throw away,” with harmful implications for human health and the environment and announced the country's new return deposit system for plastic packaging. Finally, INC Chair, Ambassador Gustavo Meza-Cuadra called for broad and inclusive participation in this process, without losing sight of the ultimate objective, to protect the environment and human health from the impacts of plastic pollution. The next session, INC-2, will be held in Paris, France the week of 22 May 2023. Countries are expected to build on the outcomes of Punta del Este, Uruguay and begin negotiating on the options for elements towards an international legally binding instrument, based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastics as called for by  . \n \nUNEP is the leading global voice on the environment. It provides leadership and encourages partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations. \nIn February 2022, at the resumed fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-5.2), a historic resolution (5/14) was adopted to develop a legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, with the ambition to complete the negotiations by end of 2024. The instrument is to be based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic. \n , Media Officer, UN Environment Programme  from IISD: Earth Negotiations Bulletin INC Secretariat:  Registration enquiries:  Media enquiries:    to prevent harassment, including sexual harassment, at UN System events. © 2024 UNEP            "},

{"url": "https://www.unep.org/about-un-environment-programme/policies-and-strategies/unep-integrity-fraud-and-corruption", "title": "UNEP integrity, fraud and corruption | UNEP - UN Environment Programme", "meta_description": "The United Nations Core Values—integrity, professionalism and respect for diversity—are shared principles and beliefs that underpin the work of UNEP and guide the actions and behaviour of personnel.  UNEP personnel are required to   Become acquainted and comply with the relevant policies, rules and regulations,  Demonstrate zero tolerance for prohibited conduct by themselves and others,   Raise awareness and take action if they witness prohibited conduct, for example, by reporting prohibited conduct, and  Undertake relevant mandatory and non-mandatory training.  Prohibited conduct Prohibited conduct refers to a staff member’s failure to comply with United Nations regulations, rules and internal policies.  The following United Nations rules, regulations and administrative issuances address prohibited conduct: ST/SGB/2018/1/REV.1 – Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2002/13 – Status, Basic Rights and Duties of United Nations Staff Members ST/AI/2017/1 – Unsatisfactory conduct, investigation and the disciplinary process ST/SGB/2018/1 – Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2019/8 – Addressing discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment and abuse of authority Acts that constitute prohibited conduct include, but are not limited, to the following: Sexual harassment, Sexual exploitation and abuse Harassment: Harassment is any unwelcome conduct that might reasonably be expected or perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another person when such conduct interferes with work or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions intended to annoy, alarm, abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another. Discrimination: Discrimination is any unfair treatment or arbitrary distinction based on a person’s race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, disability, age, language, social origin or other similar shared characteristic or trait. Fraud and corruption: Fraud encompasses any act or omission whereby an individual or entity knowingly misrepresents or conceals a material fact in order to obtain an undue benefit or advantage for himself, herself, itself or a third party, or to cause another to act to his or her detriment. Corruption refers to any act or omission that misuses official authority or seeks to influence the misuse of official authority in order to obtain an undue benefit for oneself or a third party. Fraudulent acts are any intentional misconduct that misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party to obtain a financial benefit or other benefit or to avoid an obligation and seek to evade detection. Abuse of authority: Abuse of authority is the improper use of a position of influence, power or authority against another person. This is particularly serious when a person uses their influence, power or authority to improperly influence the career or employment conditions of another, including, but not limited to, appointment, assignment, contract renewal, performance evaluation, working conditions or promotion. Other prohibited conduct includes unauthorised outside activities, misrepresentation, forgery, false certification or failure to disclose a material fact in connection with United Nations claims and benefits, acts or omissions in conflict with the general obligations of a staff member, misuse of United Nationsvproperty, medical and dental fraud, and misuse of office, including breach of confidentiality and abuse of privileges and immunities. Reporting prohibited conduct Information about possible prohibited conduct may be brought to the attention of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) Investigation hotline or the Executive Director of UNEP (with a copy to OIOS). A formal report should be detailed enough to allow for a review of the report. All anonymous reports should be filed with OIOS. All reports of possible prohibited conduct are reviewed through a preliminary assessment to decide on the need for an investigation. OIOS, or UNEP, investigates reports of possible prohibited conduct through fact-finding panels, which are set up to make findings of fact that will help others determine whether prohibited conduct took place. A disciplinary process is conducted, following which disciplinary measures are implemented. Procedure for addressing prohibited conduct 1. Receipt of the complaint by UNEP or OIOS The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), through its Investigations Division (OIOS/ID), retains the ultimate authority to review all complaints about unsatisfactory conduct. In view of this, UNEP is required to transfer all complaints received to OIOS/ID. OIOS/ID must then decide whether to review  and investigate the complaint or refer it to UNEP for appropriate action – such as conducting a preliminary assessment, taking interim administrative and managerial actions, and requesting assistance from the Ombudsman’s office to conduct mediation or coaching. There is no timeline for this phase of the process. 2. Preliminary assessment and investigation by UNEP Upon receipt of a referral from OIOS/ID, UNEP conducts a preliminary assessment. The purpose of the preliminary assessment is to determine whether an investigation should be initiated. A preliminary assessment is not a formal investigation process and does not require investigators.  It is primarily carried out by the Corporate Services Division/Legal Section or Corporate Services Division/Human Resources Section of UNEP, under the supervision of the UNEP Executive Director. Following the preliminary assessment, Corporate Services Division recommends actions to be taken, whether case  closure, administrative or managerial actions, or the initiation of an investigation.  The Executive Director makes the decision to initiate an investigation, based on a recommendation from the Corporate Services Division. The timeline to conduct a preliminary assessment is three months. 3. Investigation If a decision is made to investigate a report of possible unsatisfactory conduct, the Executive Director  will appoint a fact-finding panel.  The fact-finding panel comprises OIOS/ID-trained United Nations staff members,  staff members with prior investigation experience, or retired staff members who have conducted workplace investigations and have received OIOS/ID training. Under  ST/SGB/2019/8 - Addressing discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment and abuse of authority, the Executive Director is required to appoint OIOS/ID-trained investigators to a fact-finding panel for complaints of harassment, abuse of authority, or discrimination. Other reports of unsatisfactory conduct listed in ST/AI/2017/1-Unsatisfactory conduct, investigation and the disciplinary process can be handled by trained investigators and/or current or retired United Nations staff members with prior investigation experience. Investigations conducted by fact-finding panels appointed by the Executive Director should comply with the Investigators' Toolkit. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance (DMSPC) maintains a roster of investigators who have been trained by OIOS/ID across the United Nations. Investigators on the roster can serve as investigators for any United Nations entity in need of one.  The UNEP roster currently includes 13 trained investigators. Investigators are appointed only for the purpose of a fact-finding investigation, either by OIOS/ID or by the Executive Director. Following an investigation, the fact-finding panel must prepare an investigation report to document the findings. Upon completion of the investigation, the fact-finding panel submits the report to the Executive Director. The Executive Director reviews the investigation report, following an investigation conducted by the fact-finding panel, and decides whether the reported conduct is found to be substantiated, may amount to misconduct and should, therefore, be referred to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources (ASG/OHR) for further review and disciplinary process as necessary. If the conduct is not substantiated by facts, the matter will be closed. The Executive Director will also decide whether to take managerial or administrative action. 4. Timeline  It takes one month to set up the fact-finding panel after the decision to launch an investigation is reached.  There is no time limit for the investigation. 5. Disciplinary process Upon referral of the investigation report by OIOS/ID or UNEP, the ASG/OHR reviews to decide whether to initiate a disciplinary process, should the facts indicate that the conduct of the alleged offender may amount to misconduct. There is no timeline for the review of the investigation report by the ASG/OHR. If the ASG/OHR initiates a disciplinary process, the alleged offender is provided with formal allegations of misconduct, together with the investigation report and supporting documentation. The alleged offender is entitled to seek legal advice and provide comments. Further investigation by the ASG/OHR may be necessary.  Upon receipt of formal allegations, the staff member has one month to respond. Upon conclusion of the disciplinary process, the ASG/OHR may (a) Close the case with no action, (b) Refer the case to the Executive Director for managerial or administrative action and/or (c) Recommend to the Under-Secretary-General for Management (USG) to (a) Decide that the facts are established to the requisite standard of proof, (b) Impose disciplinary measures if the facts have been established and the behaviour amounts to misconduct, (c) Take administrative or managerial action where necessary, and (d) Decide on recovery of financial loss to the organisation in full or in part. ASG/OHR informs the affected individual of the decision of the USG following the disciplinary process, with a copy to the Executive Director of UNEP.   Retaliation/Whistleblowing 1. Protection against retaliation/whistleblowing According to ST/SGB/2017/2 REV. 1 - Protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct and for cooperating with duly authorized audits or investigations, retaliation is any direct or indirect detrimental action recommended, threatened or taken against an individual who officially reported misconduct or otherwise cooperated with duly authorised audits or investigations. If established, retaliation constitutes misconduct, which is subject to possible sanction. Pursuant to the Secretary-General’s Bulletin (SGB), the United Nations Ethics Office reviews requests for protection. The bulletin encourages individuals to report fraud, corruption and other potential misconduct without the fear of retaliation. Whistleblowers can file reports anonymously to OIOS. The SGB enhances protection for those who report misconduct (any violation of the organisation’s regulations and rules by staff members) or wrongdoing (by any person that would be harmful to the interests, operations or governance of the United Nations), and for those who cooperate with duly authorised audits or investigations. The ability to report misconduct or wrongdoing without fear of retaliation is a critical element to building an organisational culture of integrity, transparency and accountability. A request for protection against retaliation should be submitted to the United Nations Ethics Office within six months of becoming aware of the retaliation. 2. Procedure  Requests for protection against retaliation or whistleblower reports should be made by anyone who has reported misconduct or participated in an investigation or audit and believes that he/she/they have been retaliated against. In such a case, the concerned individual(s) should contact the United Nations Ethics Office. The United Nations Ethics Office is responsible for enforcing the anti-retaliation policy, which protects those who report wrongdoing. The United Nations Ethics Office conducts “preliminary reviews” of retaliation complaints to ascertain whether a prima facie case of retaliation exists. Such a preliminary review is not considered an investigation. However, if the Ethics Office finds a prima facie case of retaliation, it then refers the matter to OIOS. OIOS conducts a full investigation, through setting up a fact-finding panel and gathering facts from different concerned persons.  At the conclusion of the fact-finding investigation, OIOS transmits the findings to the United Nations Ethics Office for review and action. The United Nations Ethics Office makes the final decision after reviewing the investigation report. Upon its recommendation, the UNEP may be requested to take administrative or managerial actions. The process of addressing protection from retaliation/whistleblowing has been isolated from the concerned United Nations entity and will be handled by the UN Ethics Office to ensure impartiality in the review of such complaints. The United Nations Ethics Office produces annual reports of its activities to the Secretary-General. Information on the activities of the United Nations Ethics Office, including the number of reports received for  protection against retaliation, can be viewed online. Fraud and corruption UNEP has adopted a zero-tolerance approach to misconduct – including fraud and corruption involving its staff members, other United Nations personnel or third parties in relation to their work with UNEP. “Zero tolerance” means that UNEP will pursue all allegations of fraudulent acts involving any individual or entity covered by UN regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies and procedures. The appropriate administrative/disciplinary measures or contractual remedies will be applied if fraudulent acts are substantiated in accordance with UN procedures concerning prohibited conduct. Furthermore, UNEP may, where deemed appropriate, recover loss suffered by the organisation or refer matters involving credible allegations of criminal fraudulent acts to national authorities. The United Nations has established a dedicated framework on fraud and corruption in ST/IC/2016/25 - Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat (the “Framework”). The Framework promotes a culture of integrity and honesty within the organisation by providing information to staff members on how to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and corruption. UNEP has translated the Framework into the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Guidelines (UNEP AFAC Guidelines), which aims to strengthen the organisation’s prevention of and response to incidents of fraud and corruption by providing: Concrete and practical advice to UNEP staff members in identifying potential risk areas; A clear and user-friendly guide and reference for both external and internal audiences for awareness of controls put in place by UNEP, which are aimed at monitoring fraud and corruption; and A consolidated procedure for sanctioning fraud and corruption. On 9 December 2022, United Nations Under-Secretary-General Ms Catherine Pollard launched the Secretariat’s “Fraud and Corruption Awareness Handbook.” This helps staff understand how fraud and corruption can manifest in the various processes and functions of the Secretariat. It includes case studies reflecting some of the most common types of fraud and corruption experienced in the organisation, as well as red flags and indicators that may point to the possible presence of fraud and corruption. In addition, it contains references to mechanisms and channels for reporting fraud and corruption, as well as highlights of the process of investigations and imposition of sanctions. The Handbook is available in English and French. How to report fraud and corruption Reporting fraud and corruption follows the same procedure as reporting other prohibited conduct. Confidentiality of the process The process for dealing with prohibited conduct is confidential in order to protect the integrity of the process and the rights of those involved. To the greatest extent possible, the identities of complainants and witnesses are kept confidential and only disclosed to those who have a legitimate reason to know about the process. UNEP Annual Reports on Conduct and Discipline and Fraud and Corruption      Conduct and Discipline: 1 January - 31 December 2023 Fraud and Corruption: 1 January - 31 December 2023 Conduct and Discipline: 1 October 2021 to 31 December 2022 Fraud and Corruption: 1 January to 31 December 2022 Conduct and Discipline: 1 August 2020 to 30 September 2021 Fraud and Corruption: 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021", "content": "The United Nations  —integrity, professionalism and respect for diversity—are shared principles and beliefs that underpin the work of UNEP and guide the actions and behaviour of personnel.  UNEP personnel are required to   Become acquainted and comply with the relevant policies, rules and regulations,  Demonstrate zero tolerance for prohibited conduct by themselves and others,   Raise awareness and take action if they witness prohibited conduct, for example, by reporting prohibited conduct, and  Undertake relevant mandatory and non-mandatory training.  Prohibited conduct refers to a staff member’s failure to comply with United Nations regulations, rules and internal policies.  The following United Nations rules, regulations and administrative issuances address prohibited conduct: Acts that constitute prohibited conduct include, but are not limited, to the following: Information about possible prohibited conduct may be brought to the attention of the   or the  of UNEP (with a copy to OIOS). A formal report should be detailed enough to allow for a review of the report. All anonymous reports should be filed with OIOS. All reports of possible prohibited conduct are reviewed through a preliminary assessment to decide on the need for an investigation. OIOS, or UNEP, investigates reports of possible prohibited conduct through fact-finding panels, which are set up to make findings of fact that will help others determine whether prohibited conduct took place. A disciplinary process is conducted, following which disciplinary measures are implemented. The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), through its Investigations Division (OIOS/ID), retains the ultimate authority to review all complaints about unsatisfactory conduct. In view of this, UNEP is required to transfer all complaints received to OIOS/ID. OIOS/ID must then decide whether to review  and investigate the complaint or refer it to UNEP for appropriate action – such as conducting a preliminary assessment, taking interim administrative and managerial actions, and requesting assistance from the Ombudsman’s office to conduct mediation or coaching. There is no timeline for this phase of the process. Upon receipt of a referral from OIOS/ID, UNEP conducts a preliminary assessment. The purpose of the preliminary assessment is to determine whether an investigation should be initiated. A preliminary assessment is not a formal investigation process and does not require investigators.  It is primarily carried out by the Corporate Services Division/Legal Section or Corporate Services Division/Human Resources Section of UNEP, under the supervision of the UNEP Executive Director. Following the preliminary assessment, Corporate Services Division recommends actions to be taken, whether case  closure, administrative or managerial actions, or the initiation of an investigation.  The Executive Director makes the decision to initiate an investigation, based on a recommendation from the Corporate Services Division. The timeline to conduct a preliminary assessment is three months. If a decision is made to investigate a report of possible unsatisfactory conduct, the Executive Director  will appoint a fact-finding panel.  The fact-finding panel comprises OIOS/ID-trained United Nations staff members,  staff members with prior investigation experience, or retired staff members who have conducted workplace investigations and have received OIOS/ID training. Under   , the Executive Director is required to appoint OIOS/ID-trained investigators to a fact-finding panel for complaints of harassment, abuse of authority, or discrimination. Other reports of unsatisfactory conduct listed in ST/AI/2017/1-  can be handled by trained investigators and/or current or retired United Nations staff members with prior investigation experience. Investigations conducted by fact-finding panels appointed by the Executive Director should comply with the  . The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance (DMSPC) maintains a roster of investigators who have been trained by OIOS/ID across the United Nations. Investigators on the roster can serve as investigators for any United Nations entity in need of one.  The UNEP roster currently includes 13 trained investigators. Investigators are appointed only for the purpose of a fact-finding investigation, either by OIOS/ID or by the Executive Director. Following an investigation, the fact-finding panel must prepare an investigation report to document the findings. Upon completion of the investigation, the fact-finding panel submits the report to the Executive Director. The Executive Director reviews the investigation report, following an investigation conducted by the fact-finding panel, and decides whether the reported conduct is found to be substantiated, may amount to misconduct and should, therefore, be referred to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources (ASG/OHR) for further review and disciplinary process as necessary. If the conduct is not substantiated by facts, the matter will be closed. The Executive Director will also decide whether to take managerial or administrative action.  It takes one month to set up the fact-finding panel after the decision to launch an investigation is reached.  There is no time limit for the investigation.

If a request of information is denied, the requestor may seek the review of the decision by addressing a letter to the Access-to-Information Panel established pursuant to paragraph 17 below, providing reasons for the appeal. Every request for appeals will be acknowledged. The Panel will review the denial of requests to disclose information concerned or portion of such information to a member of the public. The Executive Director will have the authority to take a final decision concerning the request for information in question. In case of rejecting an appeal, UNEP will provide the requestor with a reason for such rejection. That review should normally be completed within sixty (60) working days of being requested. The outcome of the review will be communicated to the requestor The Access-to-Information Panel is hereby established. The Panel consists of three members, all appointed by the Executive Director: two UNEP staff members and one individual, in his/her personal capacity, from outside of UNEP. Members of the Panel will be selected on the basis of the following criteria: in-depth knowledge and thorough understanding of UNEP policies, structures, programmes and operations at Headquarters, Regional and Sub-regional or Country Office levels; thorough knowledge of, and familiarity with, information disclosure and access to information policies; and proven ability to work with UNEP partners. Members will serve for a term of two years, which may be extended for another term at the discretion of the Executive Director. The Panel’s primary function is to assist the Executive Director to review appeals relating to a request for information and to determine whether the Policy has been properly applied, and to submit its conclusion and relevant recommendations to the Executive Director. In addition, the Panel assists the Executive Director to monitor the implementation of the Policy. The Panel will deliberate with the presence of three members. The Chair of the Panel will be selected from amongst, and by the Panel members. The Panel may develop, as appropriate, more detailed procedures for the review of denied requests, review the implementation of the Policy and provide recommendations on changes which should be made, as well as re-examine the Policy on a regular basis in light of operational and other changes within UNEP. The Panel will meet virtually or in situ whenever there is an appeal for review. The Panel may also meet to consider policy matters related to the Policy and its application, as necessary. In extraordinary circumstances, the Executive Director or such officials as the Executive Director so authorizes may disclose certain information covered in the list of exceptions set out in paragraph 5 above, if the overall benefits of such disclosure outweigh the potential harm to the interests protected by the exceptions. This may include situations in which the disclosure of certain confidential information would be likely to avert imminent and serious harm to public health or safety, or imminent and significant adverse impacts on the environment. Such disclosure by the Executive Director or the authorized official would be on the most restricted basis necessary to achieve the purpose of the disclosure. The disclosure of information received from a Government or a third party in confidence requires the written consent of the Government or the third party concerned. © 2024 UNEP            "},

Following a very successful UN Environment Assembly, the resolution on the future of the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) was approved by Member States on 2 March, 2022. The seventh edition of GEO (GEO-7) preparations began with the inaugural meetings of GEO-7, which are the ad hoc open-ended meeting of the   of the GEO meeting and the  . This   was held on 19-22 September 2022. Experts nominated by Member States and UNEP-accredited stakeholders attended the   of the seventh Global Environment Outlook.

The meeting also convened expert dialogues on  ,   and   identified in GEO-6 as requiring transformation. The   were presented at a side event titled \" ,\" hosted by the 9th Annual Subcommittee Meeting of UNEP's Committee of Permanent Representatives. GEO-7 proposes to build on key findings from GEO-6 and those of other significant assessments, which are: GEO-7 will also continue to assess the state and trends of the global environment, the implications for human well-being, and the achievement of the SDGs, as well as provide an outlook that provides useful guidance on the possible environmental and socio-economic consequences of the transformational changes needed. This will ensure continuity with previous GEOs and allow GEO-7 to provide some updates on the environmental impact of the global pandemic and recent disasters and conflicts. For the outlook, GEO-7 may be able to provide modelling and scenario analysis of the socio-economic effects (both positive and negative) of different solution pathways. This analysis will provide additional rationale for Member States to implement the proposed solutions pathways. These outcome documents provide an overview of the GEO-7 meeting proceedings and the key decisions taken. They are a key point of reference in the GEO-7 process.   GEO-7 will focus on assessing solutions pathways for policymakers, providing them with sufficient guidance on the practical steps for policy development and adoption, implementation, timing, potential challenges, ways to assess and manage synergies, trade-offs, unintended consequences and harness the potential socio-economic benefits of these transformations. The GEO procedures were examined and adopted during an intergovernmental, multi-stakeholder, and expert meeting convened by the UNEP Executive Director from September 19 to 22, 2022, pursuant to the UN Environment Assembly resolution UNEP/EA.5/Res.3. \n  The GEO newsletter, GEO Matters, documents the process, activities and events of the Global Environment Outlook.

Urban expansion is causing ecosystem degradation and affecting the provision of crucial ecosystem services such as flood attenuation, soil stabilization and groundwater recharge. Further, inadequate urban planning has resulted in the establishment of informal settlements in hazard-prone areas that are characterized by limited basic services. This, together with the impacts of climate change, is putting poor urban communities often living in these informal settlements at risk.  To address this problem, UNEP and its partners are working to build climate change resilience of urban communities by implementing urban ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation (EbA). Urban EbA enhances urban ecosystems’ ability to provide key ecosystem services which can help buffer vulnerable urban communities from extreme weather events such as floods, landslides improving these communities’ resilience to climate change. The adaptation interventions of this project include developing technical guides and policy briefs to mainstream urban EbA, improving the knowledge base of EbA through awareness raising programmes and implementing urban EbA interventions on the ground, such as rehabilitating and restoring ecosystems and establishing urban green spaces.  \n To explore our other EbA projects,  For more information, please contact  © 2024 UNEP            "},

This, together with the impacts of climate change, poses a threat to local and indigenous communities that depend on ecosystem goods and services for their livelihoods.  To address this problem, UNEP and its partners are working to build climate change resilience by implementing ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation (EbA) in degraded forests and rangelands in mid-hill and high mountain areas and to generate awareness of EbA and increase understanding on the role of EbA in climate change adaptation. Traditional knowledge, coupled with scientific research, is used to develop an integrated suite of adaptation interventions to restore forests and rangelands, improve livestock management, reduce soil erosion, increase water harvesting and develop additional livelihood options from forests, rangelands, and agro-ecosystems.  These interventions are enhancing the capacity of the ecosystems to adapt to climate change and provide important goods and services to indigenous and local communities. In doing so, these ecosystems are providing a buffer from extreme weather events and temperature increases improving communities’ resilience to climate change. This project will build on several ongoing baseline projects, including the Leasehold Forestry Programme (LFP), the Multi-Stakeholder Forestry Project (MSFP), the Tree Improvement Programme (TIP), the Building Climate Resilience of Watersheds in Mountain Eco-Regions project (BCRWMER) and the Livestock Service Development and Extension Programme (LDSEP).

In San Salvador, a degraded watershed will be restored with reforestation and conservation agriculture approaches. This will reduce runoff and erosion during heavy rainfall and increase ground water recharge. In Kingston, a watershed will be restored using native tree species to mitigate the impacts of floods and droughts. In Xalapa, revegetation and soil conservation will be undertaken along a stream using species adapted to flooding. At the urban landscape scale, permeable walkways will be constructed to promote rainwater infiltration, and an artificial wetland and a riparian park will be established.

The meeting in Bamyan on 1 December discussed the impact of climate change on Afghanistan, especially the highlands region. Participants also discussed projects which are being implemented to help protect vulnerable local communities against natural disasters and extreme poverty. Hosted by the UN Environment field office in Bamyan, the event brought together partners from the Government of Bamyan, the local community as well as international donors. The participants shared plans, achievements and lessons learned, including from the UK and Australian Government funded projects in the Central Highlands. Director Eng. Sharif, Director of the Provincial Office of the Environment Agency attended on behalf of the government. UNAMA Acting Regional Head of Office, Ms. Sukanya Mohan-Das, opened the meeting by express her thanks to all government, UN, international community, and local partners for attending. Ms. Mohan-Das also highlighted the huge potential for integrated mountain area development with multiple stakeholders to address complex climate and development challenges in Afghanistan. Department for International Development (DFID) Country Director Mr Chris Austin said, “Climate finance is important to help communities and households withstand the worst effects of climate change. DFID is committed to increasing its climate financing by 50 percent within its current aid budget”. Mr Chris Austin added that the conference was an important opportunity to “listen to local views and consider how technical assistance could support Afghanistan further”.   During the meeting elders and teachers from Jawzari Village Shura (3000 meters above sea level) highlighted the harshness - amidst the great beauty - of daily life in the higher alpine areas of the Koh-e Baba Mountains. Fatima from Bamyan University presented her case study on challenges for young female professionals working to protect the environment, “Bamyan - My Home and My Student Life”. Scott Kelleher from the Australian Embassy spoke about the Australian Government’s five year commitment to resilience and livelihoods activities in Afghanistan. Actionaid, UN Environment, BORDA, Prime and other local organisations presented important work on rural development, sustainable sanitation, disaster management, science and ecology education, as well as of course climate change. Many of the important issues being discussed by international leaders in Paris this week - such as deforestation, water scarcity and mountain area disasters - are unfortunately a daily reality for the people of Bamyan. Their lives depend on ensuring the sustainability of their local natural resources. The initiative which was discussed at this Mountain Areas Integrated Development and Climate Change meeting has the potential to play a key role as a model for development. At the same time, it can address many of the broader issues related to climate change that are currently being discussed in Paris at COP 21. Think Global, Act local! © 2024 UNEP            "},

Increasing temperatures and hot days also pose health risks and threaten agricultural production in peri-urban areas. Ecosystem-based approaches to Adaptation (EbA) are a cost-effective approach to reduce the vulnerability of urban and peri-urban communities to climate change. The vulnerability of these communities is reduced by protecting, maintaining and rehabilitating priority ecosystems such as wetlands, forests, and agroecological systems. The project has the following components that will support delivery against the objectives: Specific interventions in the pilot cities range from reforestation, agriculture, and wetland restoration along with support to livelihoods, especially urban poor communities.

It is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in Africa due not only to its physical location, but also the socio-economic issues that amplify the negative effects of climate change and decrease the population’s capacities to cope and adapt. However, the country also hosts many natural resources and ecosystems that offer multiple goods and services to the local populations, including services and benefits for adapting to climate change. This project aims to reduce the vulnerability of urban and peri-urban communities in the Greater Maputo Region (home to 3 million people) to current and future climate risks by addressing the degradation of ecosystems - and their services - and enhancing the capacity of communities to adapt. The project will do so by strengthening the capacity of municipal and district authorities to plan and implement  , restore mangrove and riparian ecosystems, promote climate-resilient livelihood, diversify economic activities, and increase the available knowledge and public awareness on the benefits of ecosystem-based adaptation interventions.

The project is comprised of three components: 1) strengthening of technical and scientific capacities; 2) implementation of a rice production cycle that is resilient and adapted; and 3) leveraging policy change in the rice sector. The project is implemented in the Alaotra-Mangoro region, the primary rice production area in Madagascar. Climate change is expected to affect rainfall patterns and decrease overall water availability. This, together with continued environmental degradation, poses a serious risk to rice yields and livelihoods in the region. The project is piloting an integrated rice cultivation model that will achieve sustainable yield increases under a changing climate. Concrete changes to rice production practices (from inputs to harvest management) are being implemented, including measures to restore ecological services. Climate-resilient rice varieties have been selected through participatory field testing, and dynamic agricultural calendars have been developed and distributed to the local population. The dissemination of climate information, forecasts and early warning is also being improved. Water infrastructure for irrigation has been upgraded, reforestation activities have been undertaken, and improved livestock and land management approaches (e.g. crop rotation and inter-cropping) have been introduced. All these activities will lead to sustainable increases in rice yields. To prevent post-harvest losses, the project is also developing storage facilities with phytosanitary control, serving as trading points and markets.

Most local communities in these areas live below the poverty line and rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture and coastal resources to support their livelihoods. The project aims to address the adverse effects of climate change on the coastal communities in four regions of Madagascar. For example, UNEP is helping the government to support communities to rehabilitate mangrove habitats and other shoreline vegetation, which can provide natural flood defenses and protection against sea-level rise and coastal erosion. Hard coastal protection infrastructure (sea-wall and groynes) will also be rehabilitated to complement the natural infrastructure interventions. Efforts are underway to climate-proof and diversify local livelihoods to increase resilience towards unpredictable changes in climate. These activities include the diversification of crops, the introduction of improved agricultural, fishing and crab production techniques, and modified fishing calendars that avoid overfishing by accounting for new climate parameters and the spawning and breeding times of different species. These activities reduce the need for land clearing and mangrove deforestation while generating income and food production.

In Cambodia, UNEP and partners are helping people adapt to climate change by improving agricultural resilience, reforesting vast swathes of natural land, and establishing ‘home-gardens.’ Unabated deforestation and climate change have dried out soils and caused a fall in rainfall for some parts of the country. In response, this project trained people to grow trees in specially constructed nurseries and carry out patrols to halt illegal logging. The project is restoring at least 1,875ha of land, and forests, wildlife and water are already returning. From mountains to the coast, the project is helping rural Cambodians to set up small farms and irrigation systems to improve both diets and incomes.

{"url": "https://www.unep.org/collaborative-partnerships", "title": "Collaborative Partnerships | UNEP - UN Environment Programme", "meta_description": "Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) is an annual UNEP flagship publication. The report's primary objective is to inform the negotiators of the UNFCCC Member States, and the broader UNFCCC constituency, about the status and trends within climate adaptation at global and regional levels. The AGR also provides a set of science-based options to policymakers and decision-makers to increase ambition in adapting to climate change across key climate-sensitive sectors. Since 2014, UNEP has produced science-based assessments of the adaptation gap with the purpose of facilitating an adequate adaptation response in the context of the temperature and adaptation goals of the UNFCCC process. The adaptation gap is the difference between actually implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to climate change impacts, and reflecting resource limitations and competing priorities. An expert and stakeholder meeting, convened in mid-January 2020, discussed the future framing of the AGR and agreed on a general structure for future AGRs focuses on bringing together multiple sources of information (e.g. scientific literature, international donor project documents, and countries’ reports to the UNFCCC) to move towards an answer to the fundamental question: are we globally on track for successful adaptation commensurate with emissions’ pathways? As well as tracking progress, efforts to answer this question can help to highlight gaps in progress, for example in specific sectors, sections of society, or geographies that will need prioritization and international support to progress towards climate resilience.  To date, seven global AGRs and one intermediary update report have been produced: The first report AGR 2014 provided a preliminary approach to assessing adaptation gaps and initial assessments of adaptation gaps in three important areas: finance, technology, and knowledge. An intermediary update report prepared for COP 21 in Paris, France, in 2015.  The AGR 2016 provided a more in-depth assessment of the adaptation finance gap and its projected development up to 2050, focusing on global estimates of the costs of adaptation as well as the financing available for adaptation. The AGR 2017, launched in 2017 at COP 23 in Bonn, Germany, focused on a key question arising in the wake of the global goal on adaptation specified in the Paris Agreement: What are the ways forward to assess progress towards this global goal? The AGR 2018, launched during COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, had two parts: Part One examined the gaps that exist in a number of areas central to taking stock and assessing progress on adaptation; Part Two had an in-depth focus on assessing the global adaptation gap in health. The AGR 2020, launched on 14 January 2021, provided the first recurrent assessment of the global status and progress of the adaptation process across three core elements (planning, financing, and implementation). In addition, this year’s report took a thematic deep dive into the status and progress of Nature-Based Solutions in adaptation. The report also provided an initial outlook on overall results in adaptation at the global level taking a forward-looking approach.  The AGR 2021, launched on 4 November 2021, found that while policies and planning for climate change adaptation are developing, finance and implementation are still far behind where they need to be. In addition, the report finds that the opportunity to use the fiscal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize green economic growth that also helps nations adapt to climate impacts such as droughts, storms, and wildfire is largely being missed. The AGR 2022, launched on 3 November 2022, found that country adaptation plans, strategies, laws and policies are getting better at prioritizing disadvantaged groups (such as Indigenous peoples), however financing to turn these plans and strategies into action isn’t following. In addition, the implementation of adaptation actions (concentrated in agriculture, water, ecosystems and cross-cutting sectors) is increasing, although without a step change in support, adaptation actions could be outstripped by accelerating climate risks, further widening the adaptation implementation gap. The AGR 2023, launched on 2 November 2023, finds that progress on climate adaptation is slowing when it should be accelerating to catch up with these rising climate change impacts.  With the need to adapt to accelerating climate change, the importance of the AGR will grow in the coming years as it will provide updates on progress across key adaptation indicators. To maximize the value-added of the AGR in relation to the post-Paris process, the AGR Steering Committee favors a multi-year planning process. This implies that each subsequent AGR builds on the previous year’s content. Adaptation Research Alliance (ARA) As part of the UK COP 26 Presidency Adaptation & Resilience campaign, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO) is working with partners to develop an international Adaptation Research Alliance for launch at COP 26. This global collaborative effort will seek to catalyze increased investment and capacity for action-orientated research that supports effective adaptation to climate change – primarily in developing countries – at the scale and urgency demanded by the science. Following the soft launch at the Gobeshona Global Conference, a development phase of nine months will ensure that partners conduct the groundwork necessary for launching an ambitious, transformative, and credible ARA at COP26. WASP is a key partner in this endeavor. International Platform of Adaptation Metrics (IPAM) The formulation of standardized adaptation metrics is one of the great trans-disciplinary challenges of our time. Building knowledge and consensus on adaptation metrics are critical for climate adaptation policy and business imperatives at all scales, functions, and sectors, to articulate and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and for investment decision-making at scale. We are working with IPAM so as to find a common purpose to address these concerns. ", "content": "Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) is an annual UNEP flagship publication.

Environmental challenge Given the unprecedented speed and magnitude of climate change in mountains adding to rapidly changing conditions, it is crucial that practical adaptation solutions be developed and implemented. The IPCC WGII cross-chapter on mountains finds that current adaptation efforts are insufficient to address future risks in mountain regions. It is often the coupled effects of poverty, dependence on degrading natural resources and high exposure to natural hazards where climate change puts mountain ecosystems and livelihoods under additional pressure. Effective adaptation must take an inclusive approach that addresses climate-related risks together with other socio-economic developments. This can enable mountain communities to conserve, restore and sustainably manage the key ecosystem goods and services on which their livelihoods depend.     Addressing mountain-specific challenges and exploiting opportunities to adapt to changing future environments require a regional approach due to the cross-border nature of mountain ranges. Cooperation and exchange at regional levels tap into local (traditional) knowledge, address challenges of mutual concern and support the development of adequate and regionally-tailored solutions. Strengthening regional dialogue can also help ensure that adequate mountain adaptation policies are taken on board at national levels. Programme The overall objective of the Adaptation at Altitude programme is to increase knowledge on climate change and appropriate adaptation solutions in mountains. This is then fed into science-policy platforms for informed decision-making in national, regional and global policy processes. As a result, the long-term desired impact is to increase the resilience of both mountain communities and ecosystems to climate change. The programme – which has been initiated and fully funded by the Swiss Agency of Development of Cooperation (SDC) – aims to respond to the above challenges with four goals: To improve the availability and use of mountain observation data and information on climate change impacts in mountains; To integrate mountain climate change adaptation into planning and policy processes; To strengthen and apply knowledge on climate change adaptation solutions in mountains; To ensure that major global policy processes take climate change adaptation in mountains into account. UNEP is deeply involved in the second component, which also promotes interregional dialogue and exchange.

The overall objective is to promote collaboration among partners and across mountain regions on innovative approaches that provide mutual benefits and enhance the effectiveness of actions towards inclusive sustainable mountain development. Activities include the publication of evidence-based innovative approaches in the open access, peer-reviewed journal titled “Mountain Research and Development” (MRD), hosting several webinars, and organizing a first Mountain Innovation Fair as well as an award.

Apocalyptic fires and floods, cyclones and hurricanes are increasingly the new normal, and emissions are 62 per cent higher now than when international climate negotiations began in 1990. The evidence is clear. We are in a race against time to adapt to a rapidly changing climate – one of the three planetary crises we face along with biodiversity loss, pollution and waste. Accounting for  , the construction industry will play an important role in achieving our goal to limit global warming to well below 2°C. According to some estimates, investing in more resilient infrastructure could also save humanity a   from climate change damages. UNEP’s new report,  shows how buildings and community spaces can be constructed to increase resilience, especially in developing countries, where settlements are largely self-built. The report also demonstrates how combining ‘grey’ building solutions with ‘green’   can have promising results.    As   kicks off, we look at five ways to make buildings resilient to climate change with some examples from the region:   Studies show that by 2050,  . Coupled with the ‘  which makes cities warmer than the surrounding rural area, this puts urban dwellers at high risk. But nature provides powerful solutions. Communities can create urban forests and green spaces to reduce heatwaves in cities as trees and other plants cool the surrounding environment by offering shade and releasing water through their leaves. Structural designs can also help reduce heat inside buildings. In Vietnam, traditional housing designs such as the optimum orientation of buildings, high-rise rooms, and large openings improve ventilation. Trombe walls - heavyweight structures of concrete, stone, or other heavy material that capture solar heat are used in China, Chile, and Egypt. Green roofs and reflective surfaces can also reduce temperatures in and around buildings.   Climate change is affecting rainfall patterns across the world. Rainwater harvesting and recharge systems that capture water on the roofs of buildings are commonly used to store water during drought and reduce flood risk during heavy rains. The collected water can be stored in tanks and used inside the building during periods of drought. Another cost-effective, nature-based way to address droughts and flooding is to plant trees or other vegetation around buildings. The roots of the plants act like sponges to recharge groundwater, and during heavy rainfall,  . In China, the Sponge Cities Project is piloting eco-engineering solutions to absorb and reuse rainwater in over 30 metropolises to reduce flooding risks.   By 2025,   and sea-level rise. In Kerala, India, flood-resistant houses are constructed on pillars to allow floodwater to flow underneath. On Malaysia’s coasts, buildings elevated 2 meters above the ground allow waterflow and wetland vegetation to grow underneath, with houses and public areas connected through elevated passages. One approach proposed in Bangladesh is to build a buoyant multi-purpose building that would rest on pillars with buoyant tanks that raise it during floods. The building would function as a community center and also provide emergency shelter during flooding.   Cyclones and storms are  . They can affect buildings in many ways, such as blowing off roofs and damaging the structures and foundations of the building. To mitigate this damage, communities can build round-shaped houses and consider optimum aerodynamic orientation to reduce the strength of the winds. Roof design also plays an important role. Strong connections between foundations and the roof are critical to building wind-resilient houses. Roofs with multiple slopes can stand well in strong winds, and installing central shafts reduces wind force and pressure to the roof by sucking in air from outside. Roofs that cover balconies or patios can also be designed to break during strong winds to prevent additional structural damage to the essential parts of the house. This is called frangible architecture or ‘planning for damage’ approach.   Adapting to cold and temperate climates requires capturing heat and minimizing heat loss. Insulations in roofs, walls, ceilings, and double-glazed windows help to minimize heat loss and lead to more energy efficient buildings. In colder regions, Trombe walls can absorb heat by day and radiate it out by night when it is colder. Water has a high capacity to store heat and can be used in “water walls” – that instead of concrete, contain drums of water to store heat. Buildings should be also be oriented to maximize sun exposure, and external surfaces of walls should be painted dark. Green roofs that support plant growth on rooftops are used in many cities around the world and have been shown to provide insulation and reduce the energy demand for cooling during summer and heating during winter.     © 2024 UNEP            "},

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC)  , the continent is warming faster than the global average, which is likely to bring devastating impacts, from extreme rainfall to drought to coastal flooding. In the years to come, preparing for the impacts of climate change, known as  , will be key for African nations. Adaptation – reducing countries’ and communities’ vulnerability to climate change by increasing their ability to absorb impacts and remain resilient – is a key pillar of the  . UNEP’s   found that while nations have advanced in planning and implementation adaptation projects, huge gaps remain, especially in finance for developing countries. One approach to adaptation is rapidly gaining traction:  . These draw on the systems of the natural world to overcome the challenges wrought by climate change – and their benefits can be huge. For example, protecting forests and mangroves alone could prevent   in yearly climate-related losses. This week, leaders are gathering online for  , where they will explore challenges and opportunities for  . To mark the occasion, we take a look at how eight communities in Africa are using nature-based solutions to adapt to a changing world. Victorin Laboudallon, a grandfather and local celebrity from the Seychelles is planting forests to tackle climate change. The Seychelles, a nation of 115 islands off the east coast of Africa, is vulnerable to rising sea levels but mangrove forests provide natural seawalls that act as a buffer against flooding and storms. “If the mangroves are gone, the nation of Seychelles will be gone,” says Laboudallon. After retiring from a long career in environmental conservation, Laboudallon created his   of volunteers to help reforest his country. Laughing, he explains how his surname means “friend of the mud” in his local creole language. In the Vatovavy Fitovinany region of Madagascar, erratic rains and droughts have led to sharply declining rice harvests. With support from the government and the  , Vivienne Rakotoarisoa (pictured) and her family adapted by switching to livelihoods that are more drought resilient. For instance, rambo – or grey sedge – is a drought-tolerant aquatic plant, highly popular as a weaving material. Rakotoarisoa   has provided a more stable income for her family in a changing climate. Women and children carry branches and twigs down from the forests on top of Anjouan Island, Comoros. Rising temperatures and deforestation are drying out the soil in the area, turning forests into deserts. To counter that, the government is   plant 1.4 million trees in watershed habitats. The trees trap moisture in the ground and prevent erosion on farmland by binding the soil, helping to foster food security. A representative from Djibouti’s environment ministry inspects a tree nursery in the rapidly drying north. Djibouti is one of many African countries involved in the Great Green Wall of Africa, an ambitious plan to restore ecosystems along the southern frontier of the Sahara. The initiative is designed to prevent the spread of the desert and the consequent destruction of water supplies and livelihoods. Once completed, the Great Green Wall is expected to be the largest living structure on the planet, and   by 2030. In the Eastern Cape, South Africa, the government embarked on a vast ecological experiment to restore huge swaths of degraded land by planting spekboom, an indigenous plant. Spekboom increases water infiltration in the ground, boosting groundwater supplies and reducing flooding. The plant also absorbs carbon dioxide faster than most other trees in dry conditions. Anthony Mills, CEO of AfriCarbon, says that new green jobs have been created through the restoration, which began in 2008. “We are hoping that spekboom thicket restoration can be a flagship pioneering programme for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration,” he said. The  , launched in June this year, is a global call to action to restore the world’s ecosystems. Malawi is Africa’s third-largest tea producer but dwindling productivity, a consequence of climate change, has forced smallholder tea farmers to take up logging. This makes tea farming even more difficult. The felling of trees speeds erosion, removes an important buffer from floods and deprives farmers of the pollinating power of insects. The Malawi Tea Landscapes Adaptation Project is   to restore forests and train in professions, like beekeeping or crafting, that are less damaging than logging. In the increasingly dry north east of the Gambia, a woman surveys her crops in a community garden. Droughts, erratic rains and rising temperatures combined with deforestation have fed desertification here. Nearly   left the Gambia and entered Europe through the Mediterranean Sea between 2009 and 2019, the highest rate of any African country. But now, one of the largest development projects in the history of the Gambia is aiming to restore over 10,000 hectares of land and improve water security. Lamin Dibba, the Gambia’s Minister of Environment, says he hopes the project will not only support farmers, but also generate 25,000 green jobs to help provide local opportunities for the young men who risk their lives on the perilous journey to Europe. The Tanzanian government has been   to protect biodiversity and adapt to climate change in the Kiteto District, home to many ethnic groups, including the semi-nomadic Maasai. Here, prolonged droughts and higher temperatures have triggered crop failures and food shortages since the 1990s. In July 2020, indigenous and community leaders from Olengapa received certificates of legal occupancy for their sacred sites and cattle grazing areas, which has helped to solve conflicts over land and natural resources. The same project planted an indigenous grass species, buffelgrass, to increase the climate resilience of local pastures, as the plant is more acclimatized to the increasing aridity of the rangeland.

It’s climate change,” says Godfrey Albert, 48, a Seychellois fisherman from Mahe Island. “At this time of year, we’re not supposed to have rain and yet we have rain. Everything has changed.” Beyond erratic rainfall, increasing coastal storms, and rising sea levels are eroding the shorelines and flooding people’s land. For a country where 80 per cent of economic activities occur in coastal regions, this poses a grave threat. Gesturing towards the open sea, Albert shrugs: “I told you, man. It’s a hard life in paradise.” These climate impacts are made even worse by the destruction of coastal mangrove forests that once surrounded many of the country’s 115 islands. Mangroves act as an extremely effective defence against coastal flooding and erosion by reducing the height and strength of waves. The fate of the fishing industry, which along with tourism is the most important source of income in the country, is tied to mangroves. The forests provide a breeding ground for fish before going out to sea, and the organic matter trapped in the roots offer vital nutrients for many fish species. Funded by the  , a project worked with communities in the Seychelles – along with Mauritania and Nepal – to use nature to adapt to the impacts of climate change, a strategy termed  The project, known as  , was executed by the National Development and Reform Commission of China, through the Chinese Academy of Sciences. By planting mangroves across the Seychelles,   demonstrated how countries can build the resilience of local communities against storms and floods while improving local fish stocks. The restored mangrove forests not only protect the land from the sea but also protect the sea from land by filtering out litter and sediment as it’s washed down from the mountains and into oceans. Without mangroves, the sediment covers the coral, killing fish and the local fishing businesses. “Mangroves play a big role in the sea. They filter everything,” says Missia Dubignon, a volunteer of the  , a partner of  . “Plant a tree, save a life,” says Dubignon with a smile.  worked in three completely different ecosystems to promote knowledge-sharing: the coasts of Seychelles, the mountains of Nepal and the deserts of Mauritania. In Mauritania – one of the most arid countries in the world - the climate is becoming hotter and drier, devastating water supplies and crop yields. Here,   used nature as a defence by planting ‘shelter belts’, a line of trees or shrubs that protects an area from extreme weather. The newly planted trees are shielding crops from wind erosion and desertification by holding together the soil and retaining moisture in the ground. Tree nurseries were constructed to supply the required trees, and trainings were given to local communities to understand which species are best for warding off desertification. In Nepal, increased monsoon rainfall and decreased winter rainfall is leading to crop losses from both droughts and floods. The sponge-like properties of many tree root systems can tackle these impacts by recharging groundwater supplies during intense rain, and absorbing water into the ground during flooding. Community-based restoration was carried out by   to protect crop yields, with over 840,000 seedlings planted.  is seen as a flagship initiative for South-South cooperation – enabling an exchange between countries in the Global South in the form of technology transfer, capacity-building, policy support or fundraising.

A   was built to facilitate collaboration – it contains webinars, case studies, an ecosystem-based adaptation planning tool and other knowledge products. Research programmes were established in partnership with local universities to advance ecosystem-based adaptation science and measure the effects of the project’s restoration activities.

UN Environment is implementing the largest natural resource development project in the history of the country to make their lives better back home.", "content": "For Alagie Camora, using his dwindling savings to leave The Gambia for Europe seemed the best option after the government closed the border with Senegal in 2015, and his vegetable import business that brought in US$50 a month collapsed. But after surviving the perilous journey across deserts to reach Libya, “the back way” to Europe, he was captured and jailed alongside many other Gambians, stripped of everything they owned, abused and denied clean water, toilets and food.  After a month of hearing the many stories of countrymen being extorted and killed in Libya, drowning in the Mediterranean or becoming beggars on the streets of Europe, a weakened Camora and 140 other Gambians flew home, vowing to start a farming business on home soil. “We go to Senegal to get vegetables—why don’t we try in this country? We can encourage people to grow and stay here,” said Camora, who set up the Association of Returnees from the Back Way. The Gambia is one of the world’s smallest nations, with a population of under 2 million, yet so many Gambians have left that the   as one of the world’s top six nations for migration via Libya and the Mediterranean.  As a sliver of land with a river running through it to the west African coast, The Gambia is highly susceptible to climate change, and its people very vulnerable after decades of dictatorial rule by President Yaya Jammeh, who was ousted in 2016.  Increasingly frequent and severe floods and droughts have caused erosion and damaged agricultural lands, while rising temperatures, erratic rainfall and increasing deforestation and poor farming practices have dried up or washed away soils, leading to degradation and desertification. “In many of these rural areas, the environment and natural resource conditions are one of the driving reasons for migration,” said Alagie Manjang, Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Natural Resources. The rural exodus of largely young people means that 53.5 per cent of Gambians now live around the capital Banjul, where a lack of opportunities drives many young people to set their sights further afield, said Lamin Dibba, The Gambia’s Minister of Environment, Climate Change and Natural Resources.  “Most of them think that Europe is the solution, so they leave to look for greener pastures abroad,” he said. Bubu Jallow, a meteorologist and one of The Gambia’s leading climate change negotiators, said that a 30 per cent reduction in rainfall over the past 50 years has caused people to abandon their fields. “This influx from the rural to the urban has been happening since the 1970s, because the rains in this country really failed after 1968,” he said. Fatou Jammeh Touray is Governor of The Gambia’s Upper River Region, where there has been a massive exodus of youth, and many losses. “So many young people have died,” he said, recalling meeting one family that lost seven sons to boats sinking in the Mediterranean in 2016. Touray and other politicians are keen to dispel the myths spread through social media that Europe, a short hop across the “river”, is a poor man’s paradise. Camora’s Association of Returnees from the Back Way is looking to stop young people from leaving The Gambia and helping those who return to go back to farming by getting land in the most hard-hit provinces. The Association has already managed to secure some areas of degraded land by approaching village chiefs, and hopes that young people will be given more opportunities as the government tries to build a green economy. Dibba wants to create 25,000 green jobs for young people in their communities to stem migration and stop The Gambia from becoming even more dependent on importing food, as villages empty of young people “and they are left with only old people who don’t have the strength to till the soil”. He has high hopes of turning the tide against migration, rural poverty and the country’s food insecurity with a US$25.5 million large-scale Ecosystems-based Adaptation project. “This project is the single largest natural resource development project ever launched in the history of the development of this country,” he announced at the launch of the project in January 2018 in Banjul. The Ecosystems-based Adaptation project will   in four regions by rehabilitating degraded farmland, savannahs and forests with native species, and developing a sustainable, natural resource-based economy managed by local communities.  “The project will rehabilitate up to 10,000 hectares of degraded forest and wildlife parks through reforestation, enrichment planting, conservation of rare or endangered species as well as the restoration of 3,000 hectares of abandoned and marginal agricultural lands,” said Dibba. UN Environment will implement the project, largely funded by the  , over the next six years with the aim of helping at least 11,500 households directly and 46,500 indirectly, of which half will be women, across four target regions. “We all left this country to look for greener pastures and we’ve returned back to look for it here,” said Camora. “We have to believe in ourselves and say that we are Africans, not Europeans, and people there might be further ahead than us here in The Gambia, but as youths we need to encourage Gambians so that they can stay and do well here.”   © 2024 UNEP            "},

When we start planting, the rain doesn’t come anymore.”  In days past, family life in Madagascar’s Vatovavy Fitovinany region followed the seasons. Rice seeds were always sown in October to coincide with the onset of the rainy season. But today, the seasons are unpredictable. “There have been times when it doesn’t rain for seven months. Farming is difficult and it’s generally harder to earn money.”  Droughts and erratic precipitation are just some of the climate-related challenges Vivienne and her community face today. Madagascar also ranks third on the World Bank’s list of countries most vulnerable to increased frequency and intensity of storms as a result of global warming—with the island’s large coastal population particularly at risk. Over the last 20 years, extreme weather events such as flooding, cyclones and high temperatures have taken a heavy toll on the nation’s rural communities, severely affecting agriculture, livelihoods and access to basic necessities.  “From 1997, the flooding got heavy—worse than before,” explains 50-year-old Vivienne who lives with her husband, brother and son in Mangatsiotra village on Madagascar’s south-eastern coast. “Access to the town is hard... children can’t go to school and we can’t go to the hospital.”  On top of these challenges, flooding also causes saline intrusion into water sources, affecting both drinking water and agricultural productivity—a serious challenge in a country affected by seasonal food insecurity, particularly during the ‘hunger season’, the period between one harvest and the next. Alternating periods of drought and flooding have made the typical staple crop, rice, an unreliable food and livelihood source: “In a bad year, the rice is only enough to eat for one month,” Vivienne says. Today though, Vivienne has found a more reliable crop to cultivate. As the conversation turns to her handmade hat, she wears a proud smile. The woven hat, made from a reed known locally as ‘rambo’, represents a turning point in the fortunes of her family: she crafted it herself from her own rambo plantation.  Rambo—or Grey Sedge ( ) —is a drought-resistant aquatic plant. Although it isn’t edible, it is more resilient than rice and its popularity as a handicraft material in Madagascar makes it a valuable crop. With poor rice harvests in recent years having jeopardized local food stocks and income, rambo is fast becoming a popular alternative crop that can be grown year-round.  Weaving is not a new skill for Vivienne but cultivating the raw material is. Learning how to grow rambo has allowed her to expand her handicraft output and turn it into a viable livelihood. “I used to buy one bundle of rambo for 6,000 Ariary (US$1.72). Now we harvest about 8 – 15 bundles a month ourselves. From this, I can make and sell about ten big mats, ten small mats and six hats,” she says with satisfaction. Colourful, intricately woven baskets, mats and hats are a common sight in marketplaces and homes around Madagascar. Weavers would traditionally forage for rambo in the wild, but growing demand has opened the way for Vivienne and others to farm and sell the reed. Vivienne is one of 300 community members who were provided with rambo seeds and training in how to cultivate, care for and maximize yield from the crop under the   project.  Under the  -backed initiative, UN Environment and the Government of Madagascar are working to build the long-term resilience of coastal communities, focusing on ecosystem-based adaptation interventions, such as restoration of coastal ecosystems and enhancement of climate-resilient livelihoods. By encouraging and facilitating the adoption of ‘smart’ agricultural practices among local communities, the project has helped vulnerable communities to adopt improved cultivation techniques and reduce reliance on climate-fallible income sources, including through taking up businesses from handicrafts to vanilla, coffee and honey production.  Xavier Rabenandrasana is one of more than 250 people who joined beekeeping training courses held by the project team across the Menabe and Vatovavy Fitovinany regions.  Xavier says an erratic climate has halved his rice crop in the recent years but learning to diagnose and treat problems in his bee colonies has made apiculture a reliable alternative form of income for him, helping to increase his honey production from each hive to as much as 50 kg a year.  “Now, I produce 250 kg every three months,” he says. “With the extra income I can save, pay my debts, prepare the fields, and help support my family.” Additional project activities include the restoration of mangrove swamps to prevent flooding, the stabilization of shorelines through revegetation, and plans for the construction of a one-kilometre-long seawall to halt the problem of coastal erosion. At an institutional level, steps have been taken to increase awareness of the impact of climate change and integrate this into government planning. A series of training sessions were delivered to assist with mainstreaming adaptation strategies into regional development frameworks and policies, the aim being long-term mechanisms for sustainable integrated coastal management.  Back in Mangatsiotra village, Vivienne is demonstrating her weaving skills. She explains how weaving rambo was previously only a source of pleasure and relaxation, but participation in the project has given her a different perspective. “It became a source for earning money,” she says.  Now, not only has her income from her rambo business increased to around 200,000 Ariary (US$50) per month, but she has renewed hopes for the future. “I plan to expand by one more hectare and only cultivate rambo, instead of rice,” she says smiling. “I dream of having my own shop to sell my rambo products!” Today, Vivienne’s dream might not be far off. As the project moves into its second and final stage, there will be a firm focus on linking community cooperatives to national and international handicraft buyers in the market, bringing the philosophy of bending without breaking from the coastal villages of Madagascar to a store near you.   © 2024 UNEP            "},

Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, families and businesses around the Adriatic Sea were faced with a serious threat.  One of the countries hardest-hit by coastal erosion in Europe, almost a third of Albania’s 427km coastline is being eroded by violent waves. And the challenge is accelerating at an alarming speed due to climate-induced storm surges and rising sea levels. “One time I was driving my children to school when the sea came in front of me and flooded the car,” explains Pati. “If the coast is not protected, then God save us.” In Lezha District, where Pati’s business operates, nuclear bunkers built in the 70s during Albania’s communist era are now lost under the sea, the barely perceptible roofs only just emerging above water. “The damages have been extraordinary,” laments Pati. “Our fishing deck was completely wiped out in a storm. But who to complain to about these things?” COVID-19 came as a second blow. Prior to the outbreak, tourism contributed  , employing more than  . But with travel having ground to a halt for nearly two months, tourism in Lezha district has been severely impacted. To adapt to the changing climate in Lezha District, the government of Albania is turning to a solution as old as the sea itself: Nature. Covering around 4,000 hectares, the Kune-Vain Lagoon system is a biodiversity wonder, home to around 200 bird species, and an ecological corridor for birds on their migration routes. BirdLife International designated the region an ‘Important Bird Area’ of global significance. The lagoon doesn’t only serve wildlife, but also people, by acting as a natural barrier against coastal erosion, protecting towns and villages– like Pati’s – from flooding. Walking along a narrow aisle of sand dune – the sea on one side and the lagoon on the other – Pati explains: “Where we stand now is a protection for the villages and for the town, because if water covers this ground, the sea will get to the inner part of the lagoon and flow into the town.” If this roughly 30-metre-wide corridor of sand succumbs to erosion, the lagoon will vanish and there will be nothing to stop the sea destroying the coast. With support from the   (GEF) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the government of Albania is now reforesting and replanting 2,000 metres along this strip of sand dune. By restoring the vegetation, the project seeks to bind together the soil, strengthening the lagoon’s ability to withstand erosion. The restoration activities are selecting indigenous tree species that are both flood and salt tolerant to ensure long-term survival. This approach of using natural solutions to withstand the impacts of climate change is known as   – in essence, look after nature and it will look after you. “Ecosystem-based adaptation protects people from climate change, but also gives space for nature to breathe,” says Atifa Kassam, UNEP’s Programme Officer for the restoration project. “Citizens from all over Albania come to see the Kune-Vain Lagoon. By harnessing the lagoon to help people be resilient to climate change, we can preserve the vital ecotourism industry that keeps nearby towns afloat.” With over 90 percent of lockdown measures imposed by the Albanian government to prevent the spread of coronavirus now eased, taking measures like this to protect local tourism as it recovers is critical.   Ecosystem-based adaptation approaches to flooding are also often cheaper than concrete options like seawalls. A study of 52 different sites found that coastal habitats were two to five times more cost-effective at lowering wave heights than engineered structures. \n  The GEF-backed project is training local communities and Albanian government staff on ecosystem-based adaptation, improving the capacity of policymakers to address climate change by using nature. It is also engaging students through hands-on learning, and facilitating studies of PhD and Masters students as they analyse the impacts of the ecosystem-based adaptation at Kune-Vain Lagoon. The approach is also taking root locally.  At his beach bar, Pati points to the trees he’s planted on his private land to protect it from storms. “I’ve chosen this tree because it’s very strong and resistant,” he says, pointing to a tree that botanists call  . “It grows easily and isn’t harmed by insects.”     © 2024 UNEP            "},

Forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems act as buffers against extreme weather, protecting houses, crops, water supplies and vital infrastructure. The strategy of using nature as a defence against climate impacts is called called   – in essence, look after nature and it will look after you. Here are six ways that nature can defend us from climate change impacts: To secure water supplies, societies have traditionally used ‘grey infrastructure’ such as pipelines, dams, and man-made reservoirs. However, ‘green infrastructure’ uses natural or semi-natural systems to provide similar benefits with positive long-term environmental consequences. For example, natural wetlands like streams and lakes act as sponges, drawing water down through the ground and recharging groundwater supplies. When healthy, these ecosystems capture water during intense rainfall and store it for times of drought. Similarly, healthy forests recharge groundwater supplies by absorbing water through their roots, and in doing so, filter drinking water for millions of people worldwide, including more than  . The State of Rajasthan, India, endured a devastating drought in 1986. In the following years local communities began to   in the region, leading to a rise in groundwater levels by several metres.  . First the Amazon, then California, then Australia – wildfires were catastrophic in 2019. Our preventative efforts to reduce the spread of wildfires often involve the removal of forests to create a firebreak (or ‘fuel break’), a strip of land devoid of flora. But there’s a new strategy for firebreaks that involves   nature, not less.   was made after a severe forest fire in Spain in 2012, where the Mediterranean Cypress trees were able to resist the blaze. The cypresses retain high levels of water in their leaves, even in sweltering heat, and the fallen leaves form a wet environment at the base of the trunk. Plans are now underway to plant the trees as ‘natural firebreaks’ throughout the Mediterranean region. Cities are significantly warmer than the surrounding countryside. This ‘urban heat island effect’ has many causes, including the propensity of concrete and asphalt to absorb heat. In an absurd irony, our air-conditioning systems produce astonishing amounts of carbon emissions, which heat the atmosphere. Our houses stay cool, but the planet doesn’t.  Urban tree cover is a win-win solution for our cities. Trees cool the surrounding air by releasing water through their leaves, similar to how humans keep cool by perspiring. Imagine the cooling power of ten air-conditioning units - that’s how much a   on a sunny day from evaporation  . And that doesn’t include the shade that trees provide, which  , can reduce the air-conditioning costs of detached houses by 20-30 per cent. Major cities are now turning to nature to cool down. Melbourne, Australia, is on track to plant more than 3,000 trees each year to tackle heatwaves, almost doubling its urban tree cover by 2040. By 2050 sea-levels could be so high that 300 million people in coastal communities will  . There are some coastal ecosystems that can act as cost-effective seawalls combatting the two primary threats of rising seas: coastal flooding and shoreline disintegration. Mangroves and coral reefs, for instance, cause waves to break before they hit the shore, lowering both the force and height of the swell, and in the process reducing the likelihood of the sea breaching over into people’s land. A study across 52 sites found that natural habitats were   than engineered structures when it came to lowering wave heights. In the town of Kisakasaka in eastern Tanzania, seawater had been creeping into people’s farms and killed the crops. That is, until the villagers fought back and  . Within two years the salt-poisoning of their crops ended and the wells returned to normal. The erratic weather patterns associated with climate change are already exacerbating landslides in many parts of the world. On the Canadian outpost of Banks Island   in the last few decades, largely due to thawing permafrost caused by a succession of hot summers. All landslides are caused by loose soil. There are two ways to prevent them: increase the ‘binding capacity’ of the soil, and reduce soil erosion from surface water runoff. Vegetation does both by absorbing water and anchoring the soil in place. In light of this, the government of Comoros is   to protect people’s farms in mountainous areas. Desertification is an ongoing threat in places where the climate is drying, and where there is overgrazing and biodiversity loss. When we cut down forests, the desert further expands due to the way in which trees retain moisture in the ground. Since 1920, the Sahara Desert has  , decimating waterholes and arable land. This was the motivation behind the Great Green Wall in Africa. To halt the spread of the Sahara and its consequent sandstorms, 21 African countries are working together to grow a ‘8,000 km natural wonder’ of trees and shrubs across the width of Africa. The initiative has the potential to  by 2030, according to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.

Not so for Victorin Laboudallon, a grandfather from the Seychelles who spends his days planting forests to fight climate change. Wherever there’s a forest fire in the Seychelles, you can be sure you’ll find Laboudallon ready to fight back, armed with seeds and shovels. “Protecting nature makes me very happy in life,” says Laboudallon. “We need to protect it as much as we can, so other generations can enjoy it like I did when I was a kid.” Laboudallon, 65, has built a network of volunteers, from children to retirees, whom he calls upon to help him with replanting. “If tomorrow we have another fire, we are ready to go back and plant.” Laboudallon is widely known across the Seychelles for his decades of environmental action and his big personality. While planting trees in the wet dirt, barefoot and laughing, he says his surname means “friend of the mud” in his local Creole language. “I’m not somebody who lives under the big concrete. I live under the beautiful trees,” he says, pointing above at the iconic   palm. The Seychelles is a nation of 115 islands—known for glistening beaches and stunning biodiversity—off the east coast of Africa. Here climate change is not a distant prospect, but a daily reality. Sea levels are rising and many of the islands are low-lying. As the waters creep higher, the shoreline crumbles away and floods devastate people’s land.  “We’ve got the sea rising,” says Laboudallon. “You can see places where there used to be houses. Now there are none. There is something on this planet going wrong.” It’s unknown how the Seychelles will adapt. More than 16 per cent of the nation’s land is  , yet a study in the journal   suggests Antarctic ice alone could increase sea levels  . The waters of this tourist paradise are crystal-clear, but the future is anything but. Nature enthusiasts like Laboudallon have taken matters into their own hands. While giving a tour of his tree nursery, he explains how different types of trees offer different services when adapting to climate change. For the Seychellois, mangroves are fundamental. “If the mangroves are gone, the nation of Seychelles will be gone,” says Laboudallon. “Our protection for human life is the mangroves.” Mangroves defend against the impacts of rising seas and coastal erosion by drastically reducing the height and force of the waves before they hit the shoreline. In fact, if all of today’s mangroves were lost, the global damage from flooding would be an  This strategy of using nature—and the services it provides—to adapt to climate change is known as  . It’s often cheaper than concrete infrastructure. Not to mention that it simultaneously creates a space for nature. For conservationists like Laboudallon, this is a win-win. Communities can adapt to climate change while protecting biodiversity. It is no longer a choice between people or nature. Considering the Seychelles’ economy is inextricably dependent on ecotourism, ecosystem-based adaptation is seen as a promising approach. “Year after year, we are seeing more evidence of how nature can protect us from climate disasters,” says Jessica Troni, Head of the Climate Change Adaptation Unit at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). “In a major report, the Global Commission on Adaptation states that restoring mangroves for flood defences is 2–5 times cheaper than engineered structures.” Back at a mangrove reforestation site, Laboudallon enthusiastically explains there’s even more to these trees than meets the eye. Mangroves not only protect the land from the sea, but also protect the sea from the land. After the fire season comes the monsoon, which washes all the ash and debris from the forests into the ocean. The layers of dirt fall on the reef like a deadly blanket. “It sits on the surface of the coral and kills it. Then the fish are gone,” says Laboudallon. “Mangroves are used like a strainer. They stop all the debris coming from the hill, making sure only clean water goes out to sea.” “Mangroves also provide a breeding ground for fish,” he says. “If the population of mangroves is still in good health, then fishermen are in good health.” This power of mangroves to protect both the land and coral, whilst generating income for local fishermen, is precisely why UNEP refers to these trees as a ‘super solution’ to climate change. Under a global adaptation project called  , or EbA South, the government of Seychelles has been working with leaders like Victorin Laboudallon. Funded by the  , the project is using nature to defend against climate impacts in three ecosystems—coastal habitats in Seychelles, dry deserts in Mauritania and mountainous forests in Nepal. Projects like these are vital for the transfer of lessons on ecosystem-based adaptation. For instance, in the Seychelles crabs were eating the mangrove seedlings planted by the project. Using plastic tubing to protect the trees resulted in litter sprawled across the landscape when floods washed them away. Applying the approach of nature-based solutions, local tree planters began using biodegradable tubing made from sugarcane. Through the project these lessons were transferred to other regions of the world. EbA South was executed by the National Development and Reform Commission of China, through the Chinese Academy of Sciences. By increasing collaboration between countries in the global south and sharing solutions for adaptation, the project is seeking to create the next generation of Victorin Laboudallons. The official International Day for South-South Cooperation   12 September. Back on Praslin Island, Laboudallon is getting ready to go home after a long day of tree planting. His efforts have been widely recognized in his home country, having received national awards and honours. With a smile he tells me there’s even a local species of fern named after him—  It turns out they’re both quite rare. © 2024 UNEP            "},

The Youth Summary of the Global Waste Management Outlook 2024 aims to equip young people with the knowledge and tools needed to address these challenges. By empowering youth, we can harness their energy, creativity, and commitment to drive transformative change and secure a healthier, more sustainable future for all.   © 2024 UNEP            "},

The GEO assessments, and their consultative and collaborative processes, have worked to bridge the gap between science and policy by turning the best available scientific knowledge into information relevant for decision makers (UNEP 2016). The purpose of the course is to advance the understanding and experience of students from around the world who are learning about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), sustainability, and the environment, as well as the importance of the use of science to ensure that deliberative processes and decisions are informed by evidence. Using the Global Environmental Outlook (GEO) to demonstrate how science can inform decision-making, as well as to deepen the abilities of students to use environmental assessments. Based on a pilot initiative by Peking University, the course will provide students and GEO fellows with a structured learning opportunity that exposes them to multilateralism and the use of science to produce actionable knowledge, with the GEO as the focus.   The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in partnership with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and in collaboration with the Global Council for Science and the Environment (GCSE) have developed   The course is about motivating and empowering early career scientists. It aims to inspire them to better inform policy decisions on the environment made on the global and national stages. The curriculum is designed for graduate students and early career professionals globally, who—as a minimum—have an undergraduate degree in the physical or social sciences. The curriculum is divided into 11 modules, which could be taught in a traditional semester system or via an alternative format (e.g., an intensive two-week seminar course).  1. Introduction 2. Role of Science and Scientists in Environmental Decision Making: Ideals & Realities 3. What stops us from Translating Science into Policy? 4. Ensuring Credible Science informs policy 5. Thinking like a policymaker 6. Motivating policy change 7. Case study on plastic waste pollution of the Oceans (Midterm Exam) 8. Getting the word to policymakers PART 1: The art & science of accurate simplicity 9. Getting the word to policy makes Part 2: Using narrative story 10. Enabling policymakers to see the whole picture 11. Examination & Evaluation In general, the modules are composed of four elements: 1) an overview of knowledge and skills to be gained 2) core lecture (to be given by course instructor(s) for consistency) 3) an interactive part (e.g. guest speaker inclusive, interaction with students, panel discussion, mock negotiations or other form of target-oriented group work), and 4) an exercise (homework). Each course module builds on previous modules. The last modules of the course are designed for knowledge synthesis, skill application, and evaluation (of students and the seminar). The exact form of the assessment and the examination might vary depending on the framework conditions and regulations of the university conducting it and can, therefore, have different formats. With expert input from the Global Science to Policy Advisory Committee, Peking University will pilot the course, which will then be offered by institutions within the GEO network and GEO collaborating centres. The   will be the first recipients of this course, which will then be developed further for wider distribution.

Water and sanitation-related diseases are one of the leading causes of under-five mortality. Damage to women's health from indoor air pollution or from carrying heavy loads of water and fuelwood can make women less fit for childbirth and at greater risk of complications during pregnancy. Malaria, an annual killer of an estimated 1 million children under age five, may be exacerbated as a result of deforestation, loss of biodiversity and poor water management. Up to a quarter of the burden of disease worldwide is linked to environmental factors—primarily polluted air and water, lack of sanitation and vector-borne diseases—and  . This section contains methodology for studying the links between health and the environment, otherwise known as \"GEO Health.\" It is aimed at users who wish to study health-environment links in more detail during an environmental assessment or who want to conduct a dedicated \"integrated health and environmental assessment.\"  GEO Health in the City of São Paulo is a methodological approach based on understanding the complex interrelation of environmental variables, hazards to health, and loss in quality of life. The complex interrelation between the quality of the environment and human health is the central theme of this report.  Download the Executive Summary:    GEO is a consultative and participatory process to prepare an independent assessment of the state of the environment, the effectiveness of the policy response to address these environmental challenges, and possible pathways to achieve various internationally agreed environmental goals. © UNEP          "},

It applies the pressures-state-impacts-responses (PSIR) matrix to prepare the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) series. Municipalities can use this tool to prepare an integrated environmental assessment of their city and to support informed policy-making on issues affecting the urban environment.     The module on Climate Change Vulnerability and Impact Assessment (VIA) in cities outlines critical approaches to help assess vulnerability to climate change in the context of other non-climatic issues and stresses, such as environmental change and consumption levels, and their integration with other drivers and pressures. In this way, they use the general DPSIR  (drivers, pressures, state, impact, and response model of intervention) framework. The DPSIR framework also helps mainstream responses to climate change with other development measures.    Planning and management for sustainable development require an understanding of the linkages between environmental conditions and human activities and encourage participation by all sectors of society in decision-making.
