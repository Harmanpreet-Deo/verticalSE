This year’s harvest ended on October 5 due to poor yields, according to a Libby’s spokesperson in a recent  . The University of Illinois Extension program   pumpkins as very “tender” vegetables that are highly susceptible to cold temperatures and frost, which can cause them to soften and rot before harvest time. Pumpkins can actually tolerate short periods of hot, dry weather quite well. In fact, when drought hit America’s Heartland in 2012, the pumpkin crop  , while corn and soybean yields suffered. “I remember raising pumpkins for fun when I was growing up,” Angel recalls. “They loved dry weather and hated, absolutely hated, wet weather—too wet and they suffered from rot and disease.” Angel notes that similar events have occurred in the recent past, although “sometimes the trouble is in the spring, like this year, and sometimes the trouble is in the fall.” In 2009, he recalls, the pumpkin growing season started out with a wet spring, followed by a record cool July, and a very cold and wet fall that greatly hindered the harvest of pumpkins and other crops. Overall, precipitation has increased by about 2 inches in the early spring   in central Illinois ( ). This is consistent with an increasing trend in annual precipitation in the   during the past century (by up to 20 percent in some locations), with much of the increase driven by intensification of the heaviest rainfalls.

Women’s History Month serves to honor the first women who had the courage to break into traditionally male spaces and to acknowledge those who went unrecognized for their contributions. It’s likely all of these women faced significant gender discrimination but persevered in the name of discovery. In many cases, their achievements are still not given the recognition they deserve. Below is an incomplete timeline of women in earth and climate science history over the past two centuries. Etheldred Benett is   Independently wealthy and never married, Benett was an expert on fossils and stratigraphy in southwest England. She published books on her collection, supplied fossils to museums, and served as a reference for other geologists of her time. Because of her unusual first name, Benett was mistakenly granted a Doctorate of Civil Law from the University of St. Petersburg at a time when women were not admitted into higher education institutions. A sketch drawn by Etheldred Benett of a fossil sponge in her collection. Some fossils in her collection were the first to be illustrated and described; others were extremely rare or very well preserved. ( ) Mary Anning, a paleontologist and fossil collector, was the first to discover a complete skeleton of a  . (The Geological Society of London convened a special meeting to discuss whether the fossil was a fake; Anning was not invited.) As a child,  . Despite her reputation for finding and identifying fossils, the men who dominated the scientific community often did not acknowledge her work. Today, the Natural History Museum in London showcases several of Mary Anning’s finds. Portrait of Mary Anning with her dog, Tray, and the Golden Cap outcrop in the background ( ). This painting was owned by her brother Joseph, and presented to the museum in 1935 by Miss Annette Anning. Eliza Gordon-Cumming was a paleontologist and illustrator whose illustrations gained the attention of major fossil collectors. Her illustrations were so helpful that a paleontologist named a fossil fish for her ( ). She began collecting fossils from the quarry on her husband’s estate. Her finds   in Louis Agassiz’s 1844 Monograph on Fossil Fish of the Old Red Sandstone. Her fossils are still regarded as important specimens, held in collections all around the world. Eliza Mary Campbell, Lady Gordon-Cumming, in a portrait by Henry Raeburn, between 1815 and 1823. ( ) Mary Horner Lyell   as his partner in geology. While Charles investigated, she sketched geologic structures and cross-sections they discovered. Mary helped her husband research and catalog the rocks, minerals, and fossils they collected. Charles Lyell was an internationally recognized geologist, but couldn’t communicate with French, German, Spanish, or Swedish geologists without help from his wife. She acted as his interpreter with European geologists, as her fluency in four other languages allowed her to translate letters. Horner Lyell attended her husband’s talks as well as special lectures at the London Geological Society. A drawing of a portion of the Earth’s crust by Horner Lyell. ( ) While studying for her PhD at Johns Hopkins University, Bascom   in the corner of the classroom so as to not disturb her male classmates. This made it hard for her to hear or see the lectures. After graduating, she became the second woman to earn her PhD in geology in the United States, after  . In 1896, she became the first woman to work for the United States Geological Survey. She spent her summers doing fieldwork, analyzing her samples, and preparing maps during the academic year while   in the geology program she created at Bryn Mawr College. Her best known work is her study of the Piedmont region of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Florence Bascom ca.1900. ( ) When Wilson retired at 65,  . As a child, she collected fossils with her family and developed an interest in paleontology. While working alone on remote sites for the Geological Survey of Canada, she mapped over 14,000 square kilometers of the Ottawa-St. Lawrence Lowlands. She did this on foot or on a bicycle until she could buy her own car; the GSC would not grant her a vehicle like it did for its male geologists. In addition to her scientific achievements, she wrote a famous children’s book on geology called “The Earth Beneath our Feet.” A portrait of pioneering Canadian female geologist Alice Wilson. ( ) Eileen Guppy was the first female geologist in the British Geological Survey.  , many women worked in roles that had been vacated by men who had been called to fight. Having already worked as a petrologist and analytical chemist for over twenty years, she was finally given the official title and responsibilities of a geologist in 1943. Three years later, Guppy was demoted as men returned to their pre-war roles. Her many contributions to British Geological Survey publications and reports are rarely credited. Portrait of British geologist Eileen Guppy. ( ) Winifred Goldring was the first female State Paleontologist in the United States. She   from 1939 to 1954. She worked at the New York State Museum for over thirty years and was the museum’s first female curator. She had significant contributions to paleontology, including extensive work on   in New York, and creating innovative museum exhibits. Goldring also served as president of the Paleontological Society and was vice president of the Geological Society in America in 1950. Winifred Goldring in a motorbike. ( ) Maria Vasilyevna Klenova was the   to do research in Antarctica and was a contributor to the first Soviet Antarctic atlas. In 1933, she produced the first complete seabed map of the Barents Sea. During World War II, Klenova was appointed as head of the Laboratory of Marine Geology at the State Oceanographic Institute (GOIN) in the USSR. Her lab produced hundreds of maps that supported Soviet military operations. Several geographic features bear her name, such as Klenova Peak in Antarctica. A   map of the Barents Sea. ( ) Dunbar began her career in sea-ice research working for the Government of Canada after emigrating to Canada in 1947. She   taken at different times of the year to analyze ice conditions and determine the ice’s predicted position at different times of year. Dunbar also spent nearly 600 hours flying with the Canadian Air Force to study Arctic ice from the air. Dunbar retired in 1978, receiving many prestigious awards throughout her decades-long career. Moira Dunbar studying Arctic sea ice maps. ( ) Katsuko Saruhashi   for measuring oceanic carbon dioxide using temperature, chlorinity, and pH, called Saruhashi’s Table. Saruhashi was curious about science from a young age, according to a Massive Science article. After graduating from the Imperial Women’s College of Science, she studied carbon dioxide levels in seawater. Her method became a global standard for measuring carbon dioxide in seawater. She also discovered that the Pacific Ocean releases more carbon that it absorbs, a find that had huge implications regarding climate change. Saruhashi founded the Society of Japanese Women Scientists. Google doodle of Katsuko Saruhashi. ( ) Joanne Simpson was the first woman to receive a PhD in meteorology in the United States. She became interested in clouds as she   in her youth. Simpson attended the University of Chicago, where Carl-Gustaf Rossby, a famous meteorologist, had recently set up an institute of meteorology. Rossby enrolled her as a teacher-in-training, and she taught meteorology to Aviation Cadets during World War II. After receiving her PhD, she conducted research at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts from 1948 to 1951, then at NOAA from 1964 to 1974. She finished her career at NASA, where her most significant work was as a project scientist for its Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission launched in 1997. In 1973 Joanne Simpson led the Florida Area Cumulus Experiment (FACE)—a NOAA program to enhance rainfall with cloud seeding. She is shown here aboard a NOAA Research Flight Facility C-130. (Photograph courtesy  ) June Bacon-Bercey was the first on-air African-American female meteorologist. She was   to minorities and women. In 1954, she became University of California Los Angeles’ first African-American woman to graduate with a degree in meteorology. She then accepted a position as a weather forecaster and analyst with NOAA’s National Weather Service. In 1971, she joined an NBC affiliate news channel as a science reporter. She co-founded the American Meteorological Society’s Board on Women and Minorities, and started a science fair program to encourage students of color and girls to pursue careers in science.

After graduating in 1946, Sanderson wanted to launch a field expedition to the Northwest Territories, the first climate experiment in the region. After defending her dissertation in 1965, she made many trips to the Arctic. These visits inspired her to offer a university course to interested indigenous students in environmental science. She was the first female geography professor in Canada, and the first female president of the Canadian Association of Geographers.

( ) Though many of these women faced significant challenges due to sexism, they were still able to make significant contributions in their respective fields. During Women’s History Month, it’s important to look back on the progress we’ve made regarding gender equality in the sciences, and yet look ahead to the work still to be done. According to the  , only one-third of STEM workers are women. The achievements of these inspirational and intelligent women—and others who have yet to receive the recognition they deserve—can inspire today and tomorrow’s women scientists to persevere in the face of adversity.  Acadia National Park. “The Stone Lady, Florence Bascom.”  .

As you sink further, prepare for alien sensations: being swallowed into utter blackness and squeezed by the immense weight of the water.  Bioluminescent Ctenophora (comb jellies) brighten the ocean depths where humans and human-made machines struggle to survive the water pressure. Image courtesy  .   A deep sea anglerfish attracts prey with its bioluminescent lure. Image courtesy  . At 16,404 feet (5,000 meters) deep, you have reached the frontier of human knowledge: the   zone, a Greek word that means “no bottom.” What happens down there? Life is sparse, but scientists suspect the deep ocean could be playing a major role in the Earth’s climate system. Climate scientists know that the ocean has stored about   trapped by manmade greenhouse gases since 1955. Using data from a global array of Argo floats—aquatic robots that measure   at different ocean depths--scientists have since learned that as air temperatures have increased in the atmosphere, the surface ocean has been taking up an increasing amount of heat. Yearly global ocean heat content compared to the 1958-65 average (dashed line at zero) for the past four decades for different layers of the ocean: from the surface to depths of 300 meters (grey) and 700 meters (blue), and total depth down to 2,000 meters (purple). Surface waters warmed more slowly (line is nearly flat since the mid-2000s) than deeper waters (steep increase). Since the core of the Argo fleet can only dive down to 2,000 meters, the amount of heat going into the deep ocean is unknown. Image adapted from Figure 1 of  (pdf).  But the fate of all the excess heat that has accumulated in the Earth’s climate system in the past half century has yet to be accounted for. Researchers suspect that currents have shifted it to the deep ocean, but they can’t test this hypothesis for sure: satellites cannot see under the skin of the ocean’s surface and the   that form the core of the Argo fleet only dive to a depth of about 6,561 feet (2,000 meters). (To learn more about how Argo floats operate and take measurements, read   of this series.) At depths below about 8,530 feet (2,600 meters), they implode under pressure...or they did until now. In coming decades, the bottom-dwellers of the ocean may have a new creature in their midst: a robotic, glass orb with an antenna to transmit signals to satellites and a two-meter long tail that detects when it has reached the sea floor. Unlike the last generation of Argo robots— —the new Deep Argo floats, designed by Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Teledyne-Webb Research, can withstand the crushing forces of the deep ocean. Steve Piotrowicz, Program Manager of the U.S. Argo program since 2000, has watched the float design evolve to a glass sphere over the past few years to deal with the challenges of deep-sea diving. A sphere is able to withstand much greater pressure than a cylinder because the pressure is distributed uniformly along the surface of the device, and glass is not only light and buoyant, but it withstands compression better than steel and titanium.  Scientists launch a Deep Argo float during a research cruise in June 2014. A plastic case covers the Deep Argo glass flotation sphere containing machinery, circuitry, and batteries.

Beyond the deep ocean, the floats are also able to operate in some of the most inhospitable environments on Earth, such as the frigid waters of the Southern Ocean. To keep from battering itself against the ice, the float   conditions that indicate the surface ocean may have frozen over, and it will keep cycling below the surface until the ice retreats. The new design was put to the test   aboard the Research Vessel  operated by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research of New Zealand. Piotrowicz accompanied a team of oceanographers deploying two prototype Deep Argo floats into the ocean northeast of New Zealand. In this  , the seafloor is very flat with few obstacles for the floats to navigate around or over, and there are no strong deep sea currents that could drive dramatic changes in temperature. Before the floats are deployed, the scientists first  —“CTD” is an acronym for Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth. Based on a design that oceanographers have been using for decades, the CTD unit has 24 bottles attached to a large metal rosette wheel. The bottles collect water samples, while sensors at the bottom of the unit measure temperature, depth, and salinity. A data cable connects the device to a computer on the ship. Researchers with NOAA Fisheries use CTD devices to assess impacts of ocean conditions on fish populations. Image courtesy  . The crew lowers the CTD unit down to the seafloor with a cable, and the scientists observe the water properties in real time. Once they have the CTD data for comparison, they deploy the new deep Argo floats. Immediately, the floats begin their descent to the abyss. The operational floats’ drift cycle—from the floats’ initial descent to the return to the surface, where they transmit their information to satellites—takes 10 days, but these test floats will have a 3-day cycle. In a year, when the floats are recovered, they will have experienced the equivalent of approximately four years of wear and tear of an operational float with a 10-day cycle. Already, the test floats are gathering some interesting information about circulation such as the direction and velocity of currents in the region where they were deployed. “Ultimately, though, we’re interested in the entire ocean,” Piotrowicz says. “You cannot disconnect one part of the ocean from the other part of the ocean.” All oceans are connected through the global conveyor belt, which is a planet-spanning circulation driven by places where surface water sinks due to relative changes in temperature, density, or salinity. Original drawing by  , based on NASA and NODC data. Piotrowicz hopes that in years to come, Deep Argo will achieve global coverage, much like the present of generation of Argo floats. The fledgling U.S. Deep Argo program only has funding to deploy about 12 floats per year. To meet current science objectives, the global fleet will likely require on the order of a thousand floats. Meanwhile, the ocean’s great heat reservoir continues to churn. As the ocean takes up more heat, the temperature is rising and the volume of the water is increasing, raising sea level across the globe. Warming ocean waters also have potentially major implications for marine ecosystems, melting ice caps, and precipitation patterns. “Argo has been a game-changer for oceanographic science, and it’s only achieved global coverage since 2007,” Piotrowicz says. “With Deep Argo, we have the opportunity to take the science to the next level.” IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). 2013.

As climate conditions change, a Chicago group is working to enhance the reilience of the city's urban forest.", "content": "Chicago is at the center of one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States: around 10 million residents live in the region, in neighborhoods that range from high-density housing to suburbs with yards and open space between single-family homes. Trees in yards and parks across the region provide some shade when temperatures rise, but the region's tree canopy—the percentage of the ground covered by tree branches and leaves—is lower than in many other cities in the Midwest. The loss of 13 million ash trees to an invasive insect, the emerald ash borer, has further reduced the canopy in many areas. The cost of removing and replacing ash trees has exhausted many municipal budgets in the region, leaving little money to care for the remaining trees or time to plan ahead. The Chicago region is already experiencing temperature increases, more heavy rain events, and local flooding that can all place further stress on urban trees. These impacts are expected to become even more pronounced in the years to come. Faced with the decline of urban trees, concerned groups joined together to form the Chicago Region Trees Initiative. Their goals were to improve management skills and knowledge, increase the region’s tree canopy, and incorporate species that are resistant to pests and the impacts of climate change. Resilient cities draw strength from their green spaces. Urban green space helps to cool cities during the summer, control storm water, and capture air pollutants. Green space can reduce stress and neighborhood crime, and it provides places for neighbors to forge strong connections. Healthy and empowered communities are better equipped to deal with change in a positive way. Those benefits motivated the Chicago Region Trees Initiative to partner with Leslie Brandt, a climate change specialist with the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science and the U.S. Forest Service, to confront the decline in urban trees. Their goal was to assess the vulnerability of the region’s trees to climate change and other factors, and then move on to consider strategies for adaptation. The partners used habitat suitability modeling, projected changes in heat and hardiness zones, and an assessment of tree species' adaptive capacity to assess the vulnerability of more than 150 tree species that are currently growing or recommended for planting in the region. The assessment showed that some of the least vulnerable trees in the region are non-native invasive species. Conversely, results indicated that many of the species native to the area are vulnerable to changing conditions. After losing many of its ash trees, the Village of Riverside in Chicago replaced some of them with resilient species such as buckeye and pecan. Image Credit: Michael Collins, Village of Riverside.

Representatives from counties, municipalities, and park districts worked with experts in climate change adaptation in a series of workshops on urban forest vulnerability and adaptation. Using a structured process, they evaluated which impacts and adaptive-capacity factors had the largest effects on vulnerability. Finally, they implemented a five-step adaptation project to incorporate climate change considerations into real-world projects and planning efforts, which included planting resilient trees. The Chicago Region Trees Initiative is integrating climate change-related goals into a regional tree master plan and updating its recommended planting list to encourage climate-adapted species.

The guide aims to promote greater climate literacy by providing this educational and communication framework of principles and concepts. Artist's statement: “Climate change has compressed and conflated human and geologic time scales, making it essential to find ways to conceptualize 'deep time.' This work seeks to make notions of deep time comprehensible through visual exploration of glacier ice, as well as other earthly archives.

Climate is not the same thing as weather. Weather is the minute-by-minute condition of the atmosphere (such as temperature and precipitation) on a local scale. Climate is the long-term average weather conditions of an area. The term climate change refers to significant and persistent change in an area’s average climate conditions or their extremes.  B. The components and processes of Earth’s climate system are governed by the laws of science. Therefore, the behavior of the climate system can be understood and modeled through careful, systematic study. Our understanding of the climate system will only continue to improve as science advances.  C. To learn about how climate has changed in the distant past, scientists use natural records, such as tree rings, ice cores, and sedimentary layers. Indigenous Knowledges and historical observations such as personal journals also document past climate change. D. Scientific observations indicate that the global climate varies over time; it has changed in the past, is changing now, and will change in the future. The natural processes driving Earth’s long-term climate variability, such as changes in solar energy reaching Earth, do not explain the rapid climate change observed in recent decades. The only credible explanation for recent climate change is human activities.  E. The magnitude and trends of climate change are not the same at all locations on Earth. For example, the land warms faster than the ocean, and the polar regions warm faster than the tropics.  F. Research into past climate changes has shown that there are parts of the Earth system that change gradually until they reach a tipping point, after which they change more quickly. Some of these changes may be irreversible. The risk of crossing these tipping points increases as climate change intensifies. Ecosystems, ice sheets, and ocean currents may all have tipping points.  G. Climate models have been constructed using observational data and physical laws. These models can project a range of potential future climate conditions that result from different assumptions about the future, such as the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Models that include both human and natural systems examine how climate impacts cascade across sectors and scales and, in turn, how human systems and choices influence climate.  H. Integrated approaches that bring together knowledge from many contexts and areas of study are essential to understanding the full picture of climate change. Considering the perspective of only a single sector, topic, or region may cause climate impacts or solutions to be overlooked.  I. Coproduced climate change research projects integrate both community-based and science-based insights and solutions to climate change. Coproduced research often includes experts within relevant knowledge contexts, such as Indigenous Knowledge holders or multigenerational farming communities. This kind of research can give rise to community-based climate solutions.  Artist’s statement: “My drawing depicts 11 endangered species and their different ecosystems found in the Western United States. The most difficult challenge was making this piece cohesive, even across different habitats that normally wouldn’t be found together. I live in Boise, Idaho, and am surrounded by wild places that I consider part of my home. I want to ensure that these ecosystems are protected. I hope viewers come away with an appreciation for our Western wild places and the importance of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems threatened by climate change and habitat loss.” Credit: Taelyn B., Art x Climate, Endangered West, (2022, colored pencil)  A. Nearly all the energy that flows through the Earth system comes from sunlight. Earth’s climate is determined by the movement of energy through the Earth system—the ocean, atmosphere, clouds, ice, land, and life—and also includes energy and heat produced by humans and human activity.  B. Some of the sunlight that reaches Earth is reflected back to space by Earth’s atmosphere and surface, but about 70% of it is absorbed by the atmosphere, land, and ocean. The warmed Earth radiates heat back into the atmosphere, where the heat is absorbed by greenhouse (also known as heat-trapping) gases that radiate some of this heat back toward  Earth. This leads to the overall heating of Earth’s surface—known as the greenhouse effect.  C. Greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere by human activities intensify the greenhouse effect and drive global warming. The greenhouse gases produced by human activities include carbon dioxide (CO ), methane (CH ), nitrous oxide (N O), and fluorinated gases.  D. Water vapor (H O) also traps heat, and a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture than a cooler one. As a result, water vapor amplifies the warming caused by the addition of human-produced greenhouse gases.  E. Some greenhouse gases are more effective at warming the planet than others. The heat-trapping ability of a greenhouse gas, plus how much of it is in the atmosphere and how long it endures, determines its contribution to total warming. For example, even though there is about 200 times more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than methane, and carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for much longer, methane has contributed 20% to 30% of global warming to date.  F. Life—including microbes, plants, animals, and humans—is a major driver of the global carbon cycle and can influence global climate by modifying the chemical makeup of the atmosphere. The geologic record shows that life has significantly altered the atmosphere during Earth’s history. G. Carbon naturally moves very slowly between the atmosphere and reservoirs in the Earth, including rocks, soils, and the deep ocean. Human activities are disrupting this cycle by taking carbon out of storage underground and releasing it into the atmosphere, primarily by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.  H. While some of these human-caused carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed quickly by the ocean and forests, much of the carbon dioxide will remain in the atmosphere before it is absorbed by the ocean over thousands of years. I. As concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases increase, Earth’s average temperature rises in response. This rise in temperature causes a significant change in the climate averages and extremes that people and the natural environment experience.  Human-produced greenhouse gases have intensified Earth's natural greenhouse effect by changing the balance between the amount of sunlight that reaches the surface and the amount of heat that escapes the atmosphere. CREDIT: NOAA Climate Program Office, Graphic by Anna Eshelman A. Human activities have unequivocally caused the global warming observed over the industrial era by increasing the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.    B. Three-quarters of all greenhouse gases emitted by human activities come from the use of fossil fuels, primarily coal, oil, and natural gas, for transportation and energy. The rest come from industrial processes, agriculture, landfills, and land-use changes such as deforestation.  C. Social systems—including institutions, policies, practices, values, and behaviors—determine the amount of greenhouse gases emitted. Social systems also inequitably distribute the economic benefits of energy consumption and the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.  D. The global climate will continue to warm in the future. How much it warms depends primarily on current and future emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities. By far the biggest uncertainty in terms of future climate change is the human factor—how much action global society will take to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  E. Many of the human activities that produce greenhouse gases also produce small airborne particles called aerosols. Aerosols generally cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space, and by seeding clouds that reflect sunlight. This cooling effect is currently not big enough to fully counteract human-caused warming. Most human-produced aerosols, such as smoke from power plants and biomass burning, also have negative effects on air quality and human health.    F. Human activities continue to increase the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, although contributions vary across regions, sectors, and populations.  G. Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries or longer. This means that carbon dioxide emitted decades ago continues to contribute to climate change today. Among countries, the United States is the largest emitter of the carbon dioxide that has accumulated in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. From 1850 to 2021, total emissions from the United States are estimated to have caused around 17% of global warming, China 12%, European Union 10%, and the 47 least-developed countries collectively 6%.  H. Annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have been slowly declining since 2007, while emissions have increased rapidly in China, India, and other nations with rapidly industrializing economies. China is currently the top annual emitter as a nation.  I. Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases can limit future global warming and its impacts. Parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement set a goal of holding the global average temperature to well below 2°C (3.6°F) above preindustrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F).  J. The Paris Agreement also sets an aim to make financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. However, public and private financial systems continue to support investment in fossil fuels. Currently, global spending on fossil fuels outweighs investments in adaptation and mitigation. Current investments in reducing greenhouse gas emissions are not large enough to keep warming below 2°C (3.6°F).

Credit: U.S. Forest Service A. As of 2021, Earth had warmed by about 1.1°C (2°F) above preindustrial levels. Most of this warming has occurred since 1980. The current rate of warming is roughly 30 times faster than the rate at which Earth warmed as it emerged from the last ice age. B. The last time the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was as high as it is today was about 3.2 million years ago, when the world was significantly warmer and sea levels were between 18 and 63 feet (5.5 to 19 meters) higher than today.  C. Human societies developed over the past 10,000 years during a very stable period in Earth's climate history. The rapid rise in temperatures and resulting climate changes since 1980 mean that the economic, transportation, agricultural, and social systems we rely on are vulnerable.  D. Climate change is already increasing the severity, geographic scale, and frequency of extreme events, such as heatwaves, floods, strong storms, droughts, and wildfires around the United States and the world. As the world warms, these events will become even more extreme, worsening existing social inequalities and leading to greater health, resource, and migration challenges. Existing societal challenges, intensified by increasing climate change, will exacerbate the drivers of instability and threaten both national and global security. To deal with the direct effects of extreme events, as well as the increased instability resulting from them, the need for humanitarian assistance will increase worldwide.  E. Globally, a warmer atmosphere holds more total water vapor, and some areas will get wetter. Warmer air with more water vapor also causes heavier rainfall during storms, which can lead to flooding. However, over many regions, temperature changes will outpace the effects of increases in humidity, making dry places even drier and droughts more intense. F. Changing precipitation and snowmelt patterns are altering the distribution of Earth’s freshwater and the timing of runoff. Droughts are becoming more frequent and severe in many regions, while, at the same time, extreme precipitation events are becoming more frequent and intense in other regions. Some regions are experiencing both—more frequent or severe droughts in the summer, and more extreme precipitation events in the winter. These and other climate change impacts threaten the quality and reliability of water supplies.  G. Global warming is causing the global average sea level to rise. As ocean water warms, it expands, taking up more space. Water from melting land ice is also being added to the ocean, raising sea levels. As the sea level rises, salt water contaminates coastal freshwater sources, damages coastal homes and infrastructure, harms coastal ecosystems, and inundates islands and low-lying land. Sea level rise also increases the risk of damage to buildings and infrastructure from high tide flooding and storm surge.  H. The ocean has slowed climate change by absorbing huge amounts of heat and carbon. About 90% of the warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the ocean, altering its global circulation patterns and threatening marine life. The ocean has also taken up 25% of all carbon dioxide produced by human activities, making it more acidic and leading to harmful impacts on marine species, food webs, and coastal economies. As climate change continues, the ocean’s capacity to store heat and carbon is likely to weaken, reducing its ability to buffer the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.  I. All species, including humans, survive within specific ranges of temperature, precipitation, humidity, sunlight, and other climate conditions. Organisms exposed to climate conditions outside their normal ranges must adapt or move elsewhere, or they may face negative health impacts. If climate conditions sufficiently alter a species’ habitat, consequences can include extinction. Changes to the abundance of different species can threaten the stability and survival of their ecosystems.  J. As local climate conditions change, many organisms, including animals, plants, and microbes, are attempting to move to areas with more favorable conditions. However, their movement can be limited or prevented by natural barriers such as mountains, human-built infrastructure such as roads, or competition with other species. The timings of blooms, migrations, and hibernations have changed and will continue to change, sometimes dramatically, potentially altering food webs and spreading infectious diseases. These processes disrupt existing ecosystems and can threaten the survival of entire species, biomes, and human livelihoods.  K. The impacts of climate change and other stressors may drive people to leave their homes temporarily or permanently, either within the same country or across a border. For example, rising temperatures and shifting rainfall could lead to increased crop failures, compelling farmers to seek more reliable livelihoods in nearby cities or neighboring regions. Climate migration is one type of human migration, which can have many complex causes and impacts. If migration is sudden and unplanned, it may increase demand for scarce resources and potentially exacerbate tension between migrants and local communities. Governments may also struggle to provide adequate services amid large-scale displacement.  L. Climate change negatively impacts human health through more frequent and severe extreme heat and other extreme events; increased transmission of infectious and vector-borne diseases; declines in food and water security; and degraded air and water quality. Exposure to extreme events can result in feelings of vulnerability, uncertainty, and anxiety or depression, with negative impacts on mental health. Marginalized and low-income populations tend to be more exposed to climate hazards and associated health impacts than other groups.  M. Climate change can harm businesses, governments, and economies through costly disruptions to services and supply chains, damage to infrastructure, and lost productivity. At the same time, climate solutions will create new economic opportunities for organizations.

With careful planning and execution, actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate risks can be carried out in ways that promote climate justice in the United States, which involves ensuring benefits from climate action are shared equitably and fairly. Achieving sustainable outcomes that promote equity in the United States, rather than exacerbate inequities, involves understanding how the impacts of and responses to climate change affect different groups of people, including those who have been marginalized and underserved. Including affected communities in decision-making can help reduce risks and distribute benefits equitably.   B. Climate change is both a product of society and a force that is shaping it. Its effects both reflect and exacerbate existing social inequities, with some people and communities suffering disproportionate harm. Societies can help address these issues by acknowledging the intersections between climate change and key social challenges, such as those relating to racial, economic, and gender inequity; rural communities; public health; migration; and ecosystem health.    C. Although climate change affects everyone, marginalized and underserved communities are more likely to experience harmful impacts. The long-lasting effects of discriminatory investment practices, unequal distribution of resources, and exclusionary laws have pushed Indigenous communities, communities of color, and low-income communities into locations where they are more vulnerable to climate change. These communities are often overburdened, experiencing one or more types of environmental injustice in the form of disproportionate health-related impacts from fossil fuel-based energy systems, reduced capacity to prepare for and recover from extreme events, settlement in hotter or more flood-prone areas, or lower-quality infrastructure and services.  D. Certain groups of people are at higher risk of negative health impacts from climate change. Those likely to experience elevated health impacts include the very young, the very old, people with disabilities or chronic health conditions, low-income individuals and communities, and other marginalized communities.  E. Rural communities face unique challenges from climate change. Rural areas are often under-resourced and therefore less resilient to climate impacts. Climate change also worsens stressors they already face, including physical isolation, limited economic diversity, and higher poverty rates, combined with an aging population. At the same time, rural communities are key to many climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, from climate-smart agricultural practices, to new sources of renewable energy, to restoring critical habitats for wildlife. F. Indigenous Peoples hold unique knowledges and experiences about how to live sustainably on their lands. Their ways of life are threatened as local climates change and the ecosystems they rely on are altered. Tribal education systems are engaged in building community resilience and supporting the next generation of climate leaders.  G. An equitable and sustainable U.S. response to climate change has the potential to reduce climate impacts while improving well-being, strengthening resilience, benefiting the economy, and, in part, redressing legacies of racism, injustice, and inequity within the nation.   H. Participatory research and planning processes can help reduce inequities and the chances of causing unintended harm through climate actions. Taking inclusive and equitable approaches to addressing climate change in the United States requires that the characteristics of a community, the factors that shaped them, and the interests of those affected are central to designing and implementing climate solutions. Approaches to decision-making that are based on broad and meaningful participation by all affected groups can build trust, promote social cohesion, and increase support, implementation, and efficacy for adaptation and mitigation strategies and plans.  I. A just transition within the United States is the process of responding to climate change with transformative actions that address the root causes of climate vulnerability while ensuring equitable access to decent work and quality jobs; affordable, low-carbon energy; environmental benefits such as reduced air pollution; and improved quality of life for all. This type of transition has the potential to enable more ambitious, effective, and lasting adaptation, resilience, and mitigation actions, including by creating good-paying jobs in renewable energy industries.  Artist's statement: “This piece was commissioned by the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group. Developed in collaboration with scientists and tribal representatives, the work acknowledges the inevitable while highlighting how we can cultivate good. From the urban West Coast to the shrubsteppe of eastern Washington, resiliency looks different in every landscape. True resiliency is not bound within the realm of science; social justice is equally as vital to every solution. The piece aims to make climate resiliency concepts more accessible. After all, before any goal can be accomplished, it must first be envisioned.” Credit: Claire Seaman, Art x Climate, Imagining Climate Resiliency in the Pacific Northwest (2021, oil on canvas)  A. Adapting and building resilience to climate impacts in all aspects of society saves lives; reduces structural, environmental, and economic damage; protects natural resources; helps preserve cultures; and often results in improved quality of life.  B. Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for reducing the risks of climate change. Taking actions to adapt and build resilience to current and future extreme events and other climate changes, while dramatically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, will also reduce loss of life and property and limit damage to ecosystems and human health. C. Adaptation will become more expensive and less effective as the planet warms. Building a costly seawall today, for example, will be insufficient if water levels rise above the height of the wall in the future. Without mitigation, there will come a time when the impacts of climate change overwhelm our capacity to adapt. D. Current adaptation efforts and investments are insufficient to address today’s risks and keep pace with future climate change. Adequate adaptation would involve not only scaling up efforts across a wider range of actors, sectors, and systems, but also more transformative adaptation involving profound shifts in our institutions, behaviors, values, or technologies. For example, transformative actions could shift housing development to less flood-prone areas to account for rising seas, or redesign buildings and cities to manage heat extremes.  E. People may be able to adapt and reduce their vulnerability in different ways, depending on their circumstances. For example, some communities and individuals may move to higher ground to avoid flooding and rising sea levels, choose crops that will thrive under new climate conditions, develop nature-based solutions such as restoring vegetation to lessen storm impacts, and adopt new technologies or building standards suited for new weather extremes. However, the ability to adapt may be limited by the capacity of a community or individual to address changing conditions, or by a risk or hazard exposure that is too great to overcome. F. There is no one-size-fits-all model for adaptation and improved resilience. Adaptation will look different in different communities because risks, judgments about risk, resources, and potential solutions differ across groups of people and the places where they live and work.  G. Actions that increase risks are called maladaptation. For example, maladaptation can occur if infrastructure (like a levee or roadway) or a disaster response program encourages continued development in hazardous areas, leading to higher losses in the event of future disasters. Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence. H. A fair, democratic, and community-based approach to assessing risks and planning adaptation measures can reduce the chances of unintentionally causing more harm to natural systems and the people who are affected by these decisions.  I. Adaptation often requires financial investment in new or enhanced technologies, infrastructure, and education. Investing in adaptation and resilience efforts undertaken by vulnerable populations can contribute to a more equitable future.

Rapid, deep, and sustained reductions in global emissions of greenhouse gases can still limit global temperature changes to well below 2°C (3.6°F), consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  B. Limiting global warming requires net-zero carbon dioxide emissions— where emissions fall to zero or remaining emissions are balanced by removal from the atmosphere. To keep warming to well below 2°C (3.6°F), global carbon dioxide emissions would need to reach net zero by 2050, along with substantial reductions in emissions of all greenhouse gases. Rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are one of the fastest ways to limit near-term warming. C. Reaching and sustaining global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions will result in a gradual decline in warming. However, some long-term responses to warming that have already occurred will continue due to the long lifespan of some greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (for example, sea level rise, ice sheet losses, and ecosystem disruptions).  D. Actively removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and using natural climate solutions to increase ecosystem carbon sinks can help reach net zero even faster. Scientists, entrepreneurs, and communities are working on ways to remove some of these greenhouse gases.  E. Many countries, states, cities, and corporations have set climate mitigation goals and targets that are aligned with limiting warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F). However, current efforts to meet these goals and targets need to be scaled up and expanded to limit global warming, and it remains likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C (2.7°F) during the 21st century.  F. Technologies and approaches that are already available can dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the highest-emitting sectors. These include improvements in energy efficiency, electricity generation from solar and wind energy, electrification of transportation and heating, less emissions-intensive diets, and protection and restoration of forests and ecosystems.  G. Some other greenhouse gas emissions, such as those from jet fuel, cement production, and certain industrial processes, cannot be avoided at a large scale with current technologies. To reach net-zero emissions, additional mitigation options and approaches, such as natural and engineered carbon dioxide removal and low-carbon fuels, may need to be explored.  H. Actions by governments, businesses, organizations, and individuals can support net-zero emissions goals.  Artist’s statement: “In my art, I try to convey that we can help reverse the effects of climate change. One hand is erasing the pollution caused by industrialization the world over, and the other is redrawing actions to restore the Earth’s beauty. I have always tried to help out the Earth, through stream clean ups and more. I hope people learn from my art that they can help change the world by just doing simple things like driving less, not littering, and maybe even setting up solar panels or wind turbines. The effects of climate change are only in our hands, so we should do whatever we can to help.” Credit: Ritika S., Art x Climate, Redrawing the Earth (2023, colored pencil) A. How quickly global carbon dioxide emissions reach net zero will largely determine how much warming can be limited. Every increment of warming that the world avoids reduces the risks and harmful impacts of climate change, including loss of life. Acting sooner on mitigation and adaptation will reduce future warming and associated impacts and produce environmental, economic, and social benefits.  B. Parties to the Paris Agreement set a collective goal to limit global warming to well below 2°C (3.6°F) above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) above preindustrial levels. To meet this goal, countries, companies, communities, and organizations need to implement more ambitious mitigation actions.  C. Even if the world rapidly reaches net-zero emissions, the United States will continue to face climate impacts and risks. Adequately addressing these risks involves longer-term inclusive planning, investments in transformative adaptation, and mitigation approaches that consider equity and justice.    D. Inclusive, equitable, and just approaches to climate action in the United States can help reduce risks, improve outcomes, encourage ambitious mitigation, and create opportunities to overcome past environmental inequities. Supporting Indigenous and local knowledge holders and their practices can lead to more resilient and sustainable outcomes.    E. Human well-being is dependent on natural and managed ecosystems, which provide crucial functions and resources for nearly everything we eat, make, and do. Nature-based solutions can provide climate adaptation and mitigation benefits, protecting ecosystems and the services they provide while also benefiting people.  F. Improving climate education, increasing access to information, and communicating effectively can improve people’s understanding of risks and their ability to address them. G. Taking constructive climate action together with other people helps reduce eco-anxiety and builds a stronger sense of community.  H. Substantially reducing human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and taking actions to adapt and build resilience involves all levels of society. Actions by individuals, organizations, businesses, and governments can support adaptation and mitigation goals. In the United States, states, cities, Tribes, companies, and other organizations have adopted a range of climate actions and policies.    I. Millions of people all over the world are already working to make a safer, healthier, more prosperous, more just, and more stable world for all through climate action.

In this case, the high-emissions future represents a specific Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) called RCP 8.5.  Temperature projections in these images represent output from 32 global climate models that are all part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ( ). Projections labeled as “High emissions” represent a potential future in which global emissions continue increasing through the 21  century. By 2100, the result of this pathway is climate forcing of 8.5 Watts per square meter at the top of the atmosphere. Based on the energy imbalance along this pathway, global climate models calculate temperature across Earth’s surface for future periods. The RCP 8.5 scenario represents a future in which no climate policies are enacted. To produce regionally relevant projections, results from the global models were statistically downscaled using a method called Localized Constructed Analogs ( ). This technique uses observed local-scale weather and climate information to increase the spatial resolution of global-scale projections, and corrects for bias in the model simulations. Images of long-term averages from 1981 to 2010 ( ) show recent conditions; these maps provide a baseline for comparison with future projections. To produce the normals data, the PRISM group at Oregon State University gathered temperature and precipitation records from a range of federal, state, and international weather station networks, and then mapped them to a grid. To fill map areas between observation stations, the group used a digital elevation model as a predictor grid, and refined the model to account for local effects of mountains, distance from coasts, and other factors that affect climate in complex terrains. Shades of blue show where average temperature for the month was, or is projected to be, below 60°F during the period indicated. The darker the shade of blue, the lower the temperature. Areas shown in shades of orange and red had, or are projected to have, average temperatures over 60°F. The darker the shade of orange or red, the higher the temperature. White or very light colors show where the average temperature was, or is projected to be, near 60°F. In order to meet future needs for energy, food, and public health, planners and other decision makers need to understand how temperatures are projected to change over the coming decades. As the climate system continues responding to the heat-trapping gases we have added to the atmosphere, temperatures will change at different rates in different regions. These images can help people get a sense of how much warming their region will experience each decade so they can plan ahead for new conditions. These data also provide people with a way to compare conditions projected for stabilized emissions with conditions projected for high emissions. Comparing the two potential futures may encourage people to take actions to reduce emissions.  We used a suite of Python scripts to process and visualize LOCA (Localized Constructed Analogs) data. The processing scripts averaged the daily values for each month in a given decade from all 32 global climate models that comprise the LOCA dataset. We then calculated the median of all models in each month of the decade. The visualization scripts produced maps of the results within the contiguous United States. For further information, see the  . Observed temperatures for the last three decades (1981-2010) fall mostly within the range from 0-100°F; this is the temperature range we used to produce sets of 30-yr average temperature maps for Data Snapshots. The range was selected to reveal patterns of recent temperature across the maps. In order to generate a consistent set of maps that represent recent AND future temperatures, we needed to show temperatures from 10-110°F. Therefore, if you compare Data Snapshots’ PRISM normals images with our 30-year average images side-by-side, you will see slightly different colors representing the same data values. Always interpret color-coded images by checking the numerical values shown on their color bars. Pierce, D. W., D. R. Cayan, and B. L. Thrasher, 2014:  .

As the warmest July on record, July 2024 was more likely than not the warmest month on record for the globe since 1850. The past ten Julys have been the warmest Julys on record. The global land-only July temperature also was warmest on record at 1.70°C (3.06°F) above average. The ocean-only temperature was second-warmest at 0.98°C (1.76°F) above average, ending a streak of 15 consecutive monthly record highs that stretched from April 2023—June 2024. These temperatures occurred under ENSO-neutral conditions. According to  , ENSO-neutral is expected to continue for the next several months, with   during September-November (66% chance) and persist through the Northern Hemisphere winter 2024-25 (74% chance during November-January). Record-warm July temperatures covered large parts of northern and southern Africa, southeastern Europe and large parts of Asia, as well as areas of the western U.S. and western Canada. In North America areas of anomalous warmth stretched from northwest Mexico through much of the western U.S., the northern Plains and states on the Eastern Seaboard, as well as much of Canada, where anomalies greater than 3.0°C (5.4°F) were widespread. Much-warmer-than-average to record July temperatures covered most all of Greenland, where temperatures were more than 4°C (7.2°F) above average in many places. During July 2024, 13.8% of the world's surface had a record-high July temperature, exceeding the previous July record set in 2023 by 5.4%. Close to one-fifth (19.2%) of the global land surface had a record-high July temperature. Meanwhile, 0.3% of the global land and ocean surface experienced a record-cold July temperature. In South America temperatures were warmer than average from southern Brazil through northern parts of the continent and Central America. However, Argentina and neighboring countries had cooler than average July mean temperatures. Cold air outbreaks from Antarctica brought periods of extremely cold daily temperatures, resulting in   associated with the anomalous weather.

This July we were in   based on central Pacific Ocean SSTs [sea surface temperatures]. The precipitation anomaly [difference from the long-term average] pattern showed a strong South Asian Monsoon with heavy rain over the Indian and   peninsulas, across the Philippines and into the western Pacific. The general positive anomaly over this large area might be thought of as consistent with a La Nina-type pattern, however  , show it to be actually a little more like the El Nino composite [a map made by layering multiple maps of the same phenomenon over a span of time, such as precipitation for every July when there was an El Niño event] pattern. The pattern correlation numbers between this July’s anomaly pattern and the ENSO composites have the correlations remaining near zero, indicating the lack of overall ENSO effect on precipitation patterns this month. With the ENSO effect being very subdued, are the remaining anomaly patterns for this July due to something else or just random? Comparing this July’s anomaly pattern with the trend pattern, one can discern some similarities. In fact, the spatial correlation between the two fields is not very big, but much bigger than the near zero ENSO effects this month. In other words, the effect of global warming is showing up (to some extent) in the July anomaly field, when it is not masked by ENSO effects. The very active South Asian monsoon provided a wealth of rainfall to the Asian region, with associated occurrences of floods and landslides. This included the effects of an early season tropical cyclone,  , which flooded parts of the Philippine islands, before tracking over Taiwan and into China and then affecting North Korea late in the month. Taiwan had a peak rainfall of over 1000 mm. Over 100 deaths were recorded due to the storm. Even before Gaemi, northeastern China had a bout of flooding early in the month. India also had above average July rainfall, with the state of Kerala along the southwest coast suffering landslides and floods with over 100 dead. Africa also shows an active band of rainfall with an above-normal east-west feature across the continent centered at about 15°N. At the east end of that feature, landslides killed over 200 in Ethiopia. The Atlantic hurricane season is just beginning and early in the month the second named storm, , hit Jamaica, crossed the Yucatan Peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico and hit Texas causing significant flooding in Houston and knocking out power there for over a week. And its remnants even caused   a couple of days later. On the monthly scale Beryl helped to provide the positive rainfall anomaly across the southeast U.S., although the Mid-Atlantic states (e.g., Maryland)   this month. In the western U.S. conditions were dry, with below normal rainfall, and there were a number of wildfires, e.g., in Oregon, California and Colorado, and also in western Canada. Drought conditions extended into eastern Canada. Over western Europe moderate conditions prevailed, but with negative rain anomalies extending from southeastern Europe northeastward above the Black Sea into northern Eurasia. South America was covered almost completely by negative anomalies. Help us improve our content"},

This rise is an increase of 0.3±0.1 of an inch (8.1±1.5 millimeters) over 2022, the third highest year-over-year increase on record.  This map shows the frequency of extreme humid heat worldwide in 2023 compared to the 1991-2023 average. Extreme humid heat is defined as a day when the maximum wet-bulb temperature is in the highest 10 percent on record from 1991-2020. The map compares the frequency of these days in 2023 to their normal frequency at that location from 1991-2020. Places that are darkest red experienced 60 or more days of extreme humid heat—2 months—more than average. Places where the frequency of extreme humid heat was less than average are colored blue.

During late spring and a record-warm summer, approximately 37 million acres burned across Canada, an area more than twice the size of Ireland and more than double the previous record from 1989. Approximately 232,000 people were evacuated due to the threat of wildfires, and   impacted regions across Canada and also affected the heavily populated cities of New York City and Chicago, and even areas of western Europe. With August to October 2023 being the driest three-month period in Australia in the record dating to 1900, millions of acres of bushfires burned for weeks in the Northern Territory during September and October. From mid-August to early September, the largest wildfire since the start of the record in 2000 for the European Union burned in the Alexandroupolis municipality of Greece. The fire burned almost 232,000 acres. Overall, the total area burned in Greece in 2023 was more than four times its long-term average. This map shows global drought status in 2023 based on a scale called the Palmer Self-calibrating Drought Index. Areas experiencing the most extreme drought are darkest brown; places that were extremely wet over the year are colored dark blue green. Nearly 8 percent of the global land area experienced extreme drought in 2023—a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, adapted from  , Plate 2.1(s). The Arctic had its fourth-warmest year in the 124-year record, with summer (July to September) record warm. Below-ground, permafrost temperatures were the highest on record at over half of the reporting sites across the Arctic. Permafrost thaw disrupts Arctic communities and infrastructure and can also affect the rate of greenhouse gas release to the atmosphere, potentially accelerating global warming. The seasonal Arctic minimum sea-ice extent, typically reached in September, was the fifth-smallest in the 45-year record. The amount of multiyear ice—ice that survives at least one summer melt season in the Arctic—continued to decline. Since 2012, the Arctic has been nearly devoid of ice that is more than four years old. Very little ice older than 4 years (white) remains in the Arctic today. The year-round ice pack is younger, thinner, and more vulnerable to melting during the summer.

The Northern Sea Route, connecting the European Arctic to the Pacific Ocean via the north coast of Russia and Bering Strait, saw 75 ship transits in the 2023 open season, the second-highest number of ships on record. The Northwest Passage, which connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific via northern Canada and Alaska waters, saw a record number of ship passages. A total of 42 ships made the complete Northwest Passage transit, far surpassing the previous record of 33 ships in 2017. Eight months saw new monthly mean record lows in sea ice extent and sea ice area, and 278 days in 2023 set new daily  . On February 21, Antarctic sea ice extent and sea ice area both reached all-time record lows, surpassing the previous record lows that were set just a year earlier in February 2022. On July 6, a new record-low daily sea ice extent was 695,000 square miles (1.8 million square kilometers) lower than the previous record low for that day. Daily ice extent around Antarctic in 2023 to date (dark red) compared to all years from 1979–2012 (light gray), years from 2013–2015 (blue), and years from 2016–2022 (light red). The annual winter maximum ice extent around Antarctica has been highly variable in the past decade, with some years above average and others below average. The 2023 record low, however, is far outside the range of previous natural variability. Animation by National Snow and Ice Data Center. There were 82 named tropical storms during the Northern and Southern Hemisphere storm seasons last year, which was below the 1991–2020 average of 87. Seven tropical cyclones reached Category 5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Globally, the accumulated cyclone energy—a combined measure of the strength, frequency, and duration of tropical storms and hurricanes—rebounded from the lowest in the 43-year record in 2022 to above average in 2023. Typhoon Doksuri (named Egay in the Philippines) caused $18.4 billion U.S. dollars in economic losses in the northern Philippines and China.

But long-term changes over the period of human-caused global warming are minimal.", "content": "Reconstruction of total solar irradiance based on sunspot observations since the 1600s. During strong solar cycles, the Sun's total average brightness varies by up to 1 Watt per square meter. Changes in the Sun's overall brightness since the pre-industrial period have been minimal, making a very small contribution to global-scale warming. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on the Climate Data Record by Coddington, et al., 2016. The Sun’s energy output changes over multiple time scales. The most regular pattern is an 11-year cycle of high and low activity caused by reversal of the Sun’s magnetic poles. During strong cycles, the Sun’s total brightness at solar maximum is about 0.1 percent higher than it is at solar minimum. Intensitygrams—images of the Sun in filtered visible light—based on data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory telescope on February 28, 2014, (left), near the maximum of the last solar cycle, and on February 18, 2020 (right), near the solar minimum. Dark patches called sunspots are easier to see than their companion faculae, diffuse bright areas that contribute to making the Sun slightly brighter during solar maximum. Images from  Averaged over the complete solar cycle, there’s been minimal long-term change in the Sun’s overall brightness since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Records of sunspots show increased solar activity during the first 7 decades of the 20  century, likely tied to the peak of the last 100-year   Cycle. Following that peak around 1960, solar activity declined. In fact, activity during the most recent solar cycle is among the lowest in a century. Meanwhile, the rate of global warming has accelerated over the past few decades. A comprehensive review of published scientific research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that, averaged over the solar cycle, the best estimate of the Sun’s brightness change between the pre-industrial period and the present (2019) is 0.06 Watts per square meter. That increase could be responsible for about 0.01 degrees Celsius—around 1 percent—of the warming the planet has experienced over the industrial era (0.95–1.2 degrees Celsius in 2011–2020 versus 1850–1900). Yearly total solar irradiance (orange line) from 1610–2020 and the annual global temperature compared to the 20th-century average (red line) from 1880–2020. Since the middle of the 20 -century, solar activity has declined while global temperature increased rapidly. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on solar   from Coddington et al., 2016, and temperature   from NOAA NCEI.  Even if the Sun’s recent quietness—the 11-year cycle minimum in 2011 was the lowest in a century—were to turn into a multi-decade stretch of extremely low activity known as a Grand Solar Minimum, it wouldn’t overpower the amount of global warming projected for the coming century due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, as long as atmospheric carbon dioxide remains above 300 parts per million, not even  , which   theory predicts would begin 50,000 years from now, is likely to occur. The Sun’s brightness changes on multiple time scales, from seconds to centuries to millennia, and these changes can influence climate. The cycle that matters most on human timescales is the 11-year sunspot cycle, which is linked to the reversal of the poles of the Sun’s  . The magnetic fields are generated by a  below the Sun’s surface. Astronomers have tracked sunspot cycles since the 1600s by counting sunspots, giant dark splotches that emerge and drift across the surface of the Sun over the span of days or weeks. Digital scans of drawings by Galileo, showing sunspots he observed through a telescope on July 4 (left) and 5 (right), 1613. Images courtesy the  Sunspots are regions on the Sun where the magnetic field is so strong that it blocks convective heat flow to the visible surface. As a result, sunspots are cooler than the surrounding “face” of the Sun. On their own, they make the Sun dimmer by reducing the Sun’s net radiative output. Indeed, some early astronomers and Earth scientists hypothesized that the Sun’s energy output would be   when  . But as observing techniques improved, astronomers realized that sunspots were not the only solar feature that altered the Sun’s energy output. Dark spots are usually accompanied by bright magnetic features called  . These bright regions are more spread out and have lower contrast than sunspots, which means they are harder to see on the Sun’s visible surface, except when they are near the edges of the solar disk. As the Sun rotates and sunspots approach the edge of the solar disk, diffuse, bright areas called faculae become visible. Despite dimming caused by sunspots, faculae and other bright features make the Sun a little brighter overall at solar maximum than it is at solar minimum. These images were captured by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory between April 15 and 23, 2014—near the peak of the last solar cycle. Overlying the visible-light   are bright regions called   that are clearly evident when the Sun is viewed  . A dense network of dispersed, bright features weaves across most of the Sun’s surface during periods of high activity. Since the late 1970s, satellites have been documenting the solar cycle directly by measuring the total incoming sunlight received at the top of Earth’s atmosphere and by collecting images of the Sun in a range of wavelengths of light. These observations revealed that as the solar cycle builds, increased brightness from features like   and plage exceeds the dimming in sunspots, making the Sun slightly brighter at solar cycle maxima than it is at solar minima. Daily observations of total solar irradiance (orange line) since the start of the satellite era in 1978. Day-to-day, TSI may vary by as much as 0.3 percent, but average differences between maximum and minimum are on the order 0.1 percent, or around 1 Watt per square meter. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on   from LASP Interactive Solar Irradiance Data Center. Satellite observations through several solar cycles reveal that the difference in total average brightness between solar maxima and minima is very small, on the order of 1 Watt per square meter during strong cycles. On average, the Sun delivers 1,361 Watts of power per square meter at a distance of one  . This amount is known as the   Based on observations and models, experts estimate that the impact of this 11-year variation on global surface temperature is likely around 0.1 degrees Celsius or less. Scientists today have close to four decades of overlapping measurements of total solar irradiance and sunspots, which allow them to statistically describe how changes in sunspot numbers relate to variations in total solar irradiance. They’ve used that relationship to model the Sun’s brightness back to the start of the sunspot record in the 1600s. Total solar irradiance estimated from sunspot observations since 1610. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on the NOAA TSI Climate Data Record (Coddington et al., 2016). These historical reconstructions reveal that some solar cycles are more active than others, and that their timing isn’t completely random. Generally, 2-3 relatively strong cycles will be preceded and followed by 2-3 relatively weak ones. These alternating strong and weak epochs tend to be grouped together over approximately 100-year periods, a pattern known as   cycles. Over the span of the historical sunspot record, there have been three ~100-year   cycles: 1700-1810, 1810-1910, and 1910-2010. The amplitude of the 11-year solar cycle (formally called the Schwabe cycle, orange) is modulated by the approximately 100-year Gleissberg cycle (charcoal), in which a number of consecutive cycles of high activity are bracketed by consecutive cycles of lower activity. The start of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s coincided with a Gleissberg maximum. The relatively high activity of the mid 20th-century also coincided with a Gleissberg maximum, while the recent decades coincide with a Gleissberg minimum. NOAA Climate.gov image based on data from Wang and Lean, 2021. In addition, the record shows that there have been periods when sunspots virtually disappear for several decades. (Other features of the 11-year solar cycle continue to occur, however.) These periods are called Grand Solar Minimums. For example, between 1645-1715, the Sun went through a 70-year quiet period known as the Maunder Minimum. Sunspots disappeared almost completely, and the solar wind was maybe  . The Maunder Minimum partially overlapped a centuries-long cold spell called the Little Ice Age, which was strongest in the Northern Hemisphere between 1450­-1850. A 2000-year temperature history of the Northern Hemisphere outside the tropics shows a warm period that peaked around 1,000 A.D. followed by a multi-century period of cooling: the Little Ice Age. The coldest part of the Little Ice Age overlapped the very low solar activity of the Maunder Minimum, but the cold spell began well before. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on   from Christiansen and Ljungqvist, 2012. In contrast, the Sun was unusually active in the twentieth century, a period which solar experts call the Modern Maximum. Starting near the turn of the twentieth century, each solar cycle was increasingly active. This build up was tied to the last   Cycle, which peaked during solar cycle 19 in 1957. Solar activity then declined in the second half of the 20 -century. The stretch of high activity drew to a definite close in the first decade of the twenty-first century with solar cycle 23, which had an unusually long and low minimum. Solar cycle 24 went on to have one of the lowest maximums of the last 70 years, and solar cycle 25 is expected to be comparable. Meanwhile, Earth's surface temperatures continued to rise rapidly. Taken together, the increasing solar activity of the first half of the 20th century and the decreasing activity since then have largely canceled each other out in terms of their influence on global temperature. In the Sixth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, experts concluded that the best estimate for the influence of the Sun on climate between the pre-industrial (1850-1900) and the present (2010-2019) was that it added 0.01 Watts per square meter to the global energy imbalance causing global warming. Such a small energy imbalance (scientists call it a  ) is likely to be responsible for no more than 0.01 degrees Celsius of warming over that period. That’s 100 times smaller than the overall warming that’s occurred on Earth over the industrial period, which the   estimates as 0.95–1.2 degrees Celsius in 2011–2020 versus 1850–1900. The modern sunspot record tells us about solar activity over the past four centuries. Indirect evidence for solar activity deeper in the past comes from the presence of  —radioactive atoms that are generated when common isotopes of an element are struck by  . Our solar system is constantly bombarded with galactic cosmic rays, but the Sun’s magnetic field shields us from most of them. When the Sun’s magnetic field is strong, at solar maximum, fewer cosmic rays reach the atmosphere, creating very few   isotopes.  At solar minimum, when the Sun’s magnetic field is weaker, slightly more cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere, generating more   isotopes. The two most common   isotopes are carbon-14, which can be found in tree rings, and beryllium-10, which is found in ice cores. Using fluctuations in   isotopes, experts have reconstructed solar activity back thousands of years. A reconstruction of total solar irradiance over the past 9,400 years based on a combination of carbon-14 isotopes in tree rings and beryllium-10 in ice cores. The record indicates there have been at least 25 Grand Solar Minimums in the Holocene. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on   from Steinhilber et al., 2012. These   reconstructions reveal that the Sun has produced at least 25 grand minimums in the past 9,000 years. Some are short—just two or three decades—and others, like the Maunder Minimum, are five or more decades. They occur every 200 years or so, a period known as the de Vries cycle. Many of them were preceded by a solar cycle with an unusually long and low solar minimum, similar to the minimum of 2008. Naturally, climate experts began to wonder: if the Sun were on the verge of a new grand minimum, how would it affect global warming? In one   published in 2013, scientists explored the impact on global warming if a grand solar minimum strong enough to reduce total solar irradiance by 0.25% (a total solar irradiance decrease of 3.4 Watts per square meter) were to begin in 2025 and last through 2065. If greenhouse gas emissions proceed along a lower path (RCP 4.5) in the coming decades, a Maunder-like minimum might reduce the amount of global warming expected by 2065 by around 20%. In a future with moderately high levels of greenhouse gases, large areas of the high northern latitudes could experience winter warming of at least 6 degrees Celsius (11 degrees Fahrenheit, left). A strong Grand Solar minimum could reduce but not eliminate this warming (right). NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from Spiegl and Langematz, 2020. Additional experiments have compared the impacts of grand solar minimums of different strengths with different emissions paths. For example, for a future in which greenhouse gases follow an intermediate pathway (RCP 6.0),   that a relatively weak Grand Solar Minimum, during which total solar irradiance dropped by 1.3 Watts per square meters for 5 decades in the middle of this century, could reduce global warming by 10%. To reach a 20% reduction in global warming, the Grand Solar Minimum would have to be   strong: sunlight at the top of the atmosphere would need to drop by nearly 6 Watts per square meter. A drop that large would significantly exceed what our current understanding of the Sun says is realistic.  On the whole, these and   find consistent results. While the Sun's influence is detectable in Earth's temperature records, the global-scale warming influence of human-produced greenhouse gases is likely to be far stronger than even a very strong Grand Solar Minimum The 11-year sunspot cycle and its   modulation cause small changes in the Sun’s actual brightness—how much sunlight the Sun radiates to Earth. Earth’s climate is also affected by how much sunlight   us due to changes in our planet’s orbit and position in space relative to the Sun. Called  , these predictable orbital patterns have repeat times of tens to hundreds of thousands of years. For the past million years at least,   cycles have coincided with 100,000-year-long ice ages punctuated by short intervals of rapid warming. Although there are pieces of the puzzle experts still don’t understand, the key climate influence seems to be changes in the amount of incoming sunlight, or  , reaching the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during the summer. The Northern Hemisphere is key to the ice ages because massive ice sheets can only grow over land, not ocean, and most of Earth’s land area has been concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere for at least tens of millions of years. The most significant changes in Northern Hemisphere insolation come from three variations in Earth’s orbit: Because these cycles have different lengths, they overlap in complex rhythms, reinforcing one another at some times and offsetting one other at others.  Northern Hemisphere summer insolation is maximized when tilt is extreme, eccentricity is extreme, and precession causes Northern Hemisphere summer solstice to occur near perihelion, the place in its orbit when Earth is closest to the Sun. Summer insolation is minimized when tilt is smaller, eccentricity is extreme, and Northern Hemisphere summer solstice occurs near aphelion, when Earth is farthest from the Sun. ( ) Milankovitch cycles over the past million years (tilt, precession, and eccentricity. ( ) Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. ( ) Global ice volume inferred from oxygen isotopes in sea floor sediments. Light gray column highlights conditions around 220,000 years ago, when overlap among the three orbital cycles brought a peak in Northern Hemisphere insolation, triggering a warming period with low ice sheet volume. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005. How low summer insolation must fall to trigger an ice age depends on how high atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are; the more carbon dioxide, the lower the insolation must be. Looking back   the highest carbon dioxide level at the start of   ice age was 300 ppm, and most were far lower. Scientists have used these past relationships to help build Earth system models that can predict how low the summertime insolation would need to fall to trigger the next ice age. One modeling experiment   that Earth may have narrowly missed the initiation of a new ice age just before the start of the Industrial Revolution. Peak summer insolation was near an orbital minimum, and if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels had been 240 ppm instead of 280, ice sheets might have begun building up across parts of Alaska, Northern Canada, Iceland, and Scandinavia.  Yellow lines show changes in incoming sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere due to Milankovitch cycles over the next 500,000 years. (l ) At pre-industrial levels carbon dioxide levels of around 280 parts per million (ppm), insolation must drop below about 455 watts/m  (red line) to trigger an ice age, a threshold that will be reached around 50,000 years from now (blue snowflake). The higher the atmospheric carbon dioxide level, the lower the insolation has to fall to trigger an ice age, delaying the possibility for the next ice age by tens of thousands of years ( ) or more ( ). NOAA Climate.gov graphic, based on data from Archer and Ganopolski, 2005.  that at pre-industrial carbon dioxide levels, summer insolation at 65° North need only dip 0.75 standard deviations below the mean—about 15 Watts per square meter—for summers to be too cool to melt all the winter snow, a low that Milankovitch cycles predict we will next hit about 50,000 years from now. At 400 parts per million, summer insolation would need to fall twice as much—a low we will next see 125,000 years from now. At carbon dioxide levels above 560 parts per million, the study predicted, no Milankovitch variation within the next half million years will be low enough to trigger an ice age.

Places where snow-covered days declined by up to three days per decade are shown in brown; places where snow-covered days increased by up to 3 days per decade are blue-green. (Only places that had snow in at least 25% of the years on record are included in the analysis). Most of the Northern Hemisphere has experienced declines in the number of snow-covered spring days over the past 5 decades. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data and analysis by  . Natural patterns of climate variability such as the   and the   can affect the total amount of snow that falls each year. In different phases of these climate patterns, some regions receive abnormally large or small amounts of snow. Despite this yearly variability, the long-term trend in the Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover is negative. Between 1967 and 2022, April snow cover declined by 1.32 percent per decade, May snow cover by 4.1 percent per decade, and June snow cover by 12.95 percent per decade. (Explore trends in monthly snow cover using the   at NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.) Looking at just the Arctic, snow cover extent, duration, depth, and water stored by the snowpack are all declining. Overall, snow is declining in both the Eurasian Arctic and the North American Arctic, although just how   below average the snow extent is varies from month to month and region to region as a result of natural variability. For example, according to NOAA's  , 2021 spring snow cover extent in the Eurasian Arctic was well below average in May (5  lowest on record) and June (3rd lowest). In the North American side of the Arctic, however, snow deficits were smaller,  ranking 14  lowest in May and 16  lowest in June. In fact, spring snow cover in the Arctic is disappearing even faster than summer sea ice. Beginning in the 1960s, weekly maps of snow extent in the Northern Hemisphere have been made from satellite imagery. Now, satellites provide daily maps of snow cover for both hemispheres. Ground observations, precipitation gauges, and weather stations with pressure-sensitive “pillows” measure the amount of snow on the ground and validate the satellite maps. About one-third of Earth’s land surface is covered by snow for some part of the year. The bright white covering affects global conditions by reflecting solar energy away from surfaces that would otherwise absorb it. Therefore, the earlier decrease in snow cover increases the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth, and in turn, surface temperatures. In step with earlier dates of spring budburst for many plant species, reduced spring snow cover is a sign that winter conditions are lasting for a shorter period while growing seasons are getting longer. A willow ptarmigan mid-way between its brown summer and all-white winter plumage. In the cold season, these Arctic birds burrow under an insulating layer of snow that piles up in willow thickets. Lack of snow leaves them exposed to the elements and to predators. NPS   by Tim Rains. At regional and local scales, water resource managers, flood forecasters, and farmers are intensely interested in knowing how much water is in snow and when it will melt. Locally, snow provides moisture to soil and plants. On a larger scale, runoff from melting snow feeds streams and rivers that supply water for agriculture and cities. Knowing when and how quickly snow will turn to water is essential for forecasting if water from snowmelt will soak into the ground or cause flooding. In managed watersheds, earlier melting of snow can change when and how much water is available for various uses. Mudryk, A. Elias Chereque, R. Brown, C. Derksen, K. Luojus, and B. Decharme.

The highest odds for a much drier than normal September are in the Upper Midwest.", "content": "After a very hot early and middle part of summer, August provided a welcome relief across much of the nation, with much-above-normal temperatures largely confined to the Deep South. The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer. Summer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August. As we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here’s the outlook from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September. The U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean  , not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September.  or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only   available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.  On August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above   across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above   along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest. The precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean  , not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September.  or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only   available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.  In addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I’ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here’s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the   outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found  . The updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC’s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With   it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in   and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks. The September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. (  means “in the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.”) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with   odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions. The best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is “equal chances” along the coast. It’s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so “equal chances” is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month. The precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-“equal chances” forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough. Below-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods. The amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing   and   drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards. The summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our   based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project.  Regionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north. U.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See   for Alaska and Hawaii. With above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.

Not all of that heating is detectable yet at the surface", "content": "Rising amounts of greenhouse gases are preventing heat radiated from Earth’s surface from escaping into space as freely as it used to. Most of the excess atmospheric heat is passed back to the ocean. As a result, upper ocean heat content has increased significantly over the past few decades. Upper layers are accumulating heat faster than deeper layers, but averaged over the full depth of the ocean, the 1993–2022 heat-gain rates are approximately 0.64 to 0.83 Watts per square meter averaged over the surface of the Earth. Seasonal (3-month) heat energy in the top half-mile of the ocean compared to the 1955-2006 average. Heat content in the global ocean has been consistently above-average (red bars) since the mid-1990s. More than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the Earth system due to human-caused global warming has been absorbed by the oceans. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on   from the   product collection.   Change in heat content in the upper 2,300 feet (700 meters) of the ocean from 1993-2022. Between 1993–2022, heat content rose by up to 6 Watts per square meter in parts of the ocean (dark orange). Some areas lost heat (blue), but overall, the ocean gained more heat than it lost. The changes in areas covered with the gray shading were small relative to the range of natural variability. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NCEI. The ocean is the largest solar energy collector on Earth. Not only does water cover more than 70 percent of our planet’s surface, it can also absorb large amounts of heat without a large increase in temperature. This tremendous ability to store and release heat over long periods of time gives the ocean a central role in stabilizing Earth’s climate system. The main source of ocean heat is sunlight. Additionally, clouds, water vapor, and greenhouse gases emit heat that they have absorbed, and some of that heat energy enters the ocean. Waves, tides, and currents constantly mix the ocean, moving heat from warmer to cooler latitudes and to deeper levels. Heat absorbed by the ocean is moved from one place to another, but it doesn’t disappear. The heat energy eventually re-enters the rest of the Earth system by melting ice shelves, evaporating water, or directly reheating the atmosphere. Thus, heat energy in the ocean can warm the planet for decades after it was absorbed. If the ocean absorbs more heat than it releases over a given time span, its heat content increases. Knowing how much heat energy the ocean absorbs and releases is essential for understanding and modeling global climate. Historically, taking the ocean’s temperature required ships to dangle sensors or sample collectors into the water. This time-consuming method could only provide temperatures for a small part of the planet’s vast ocean. To get global coverage, scientists turned to satellites that measure the height of the ocean’s surface. As water warms, it expands, so estimates for ocean temperature can be deduced from sea surface heights. To get a more complete picture of ocean heat content at different depths, scientists and engineers also use a range of temperature-sensing instruments. Among these are a fleet of more than 3,000 robotic “floats” that measure ocean temperature around the world. Known as Argo floats, the sensors drift through the ocean at different depths. Every 10 days or so, according to their programmed instructions, they rise through the water, recording temperature (and salinity) as they ascend. When a float reaches the surface, it sends its location and other information to scientists via satellite, and then descends again. Instruments for taking ocean temperatures include Conductivity-Temperature-Depth instruments (known as CTDs), Expendable Bathythermographs (known as XBTs), and Argo floats. Seals have even been fitted with instruments to obtain temperatures in areas that are difficult to reach. (Photos courtesy of NOAA, Kara Lavender, and M. Weise, California Sea Grant.) Scientists constantly compare data from satellites, floats, and probes to verify that the values they produce make sense. They process the range of measurements to calculate an estimate for global average ocean heat content every three months. Converting the temperatures to joules (a standard unit of energy) allows them to compare heat in the ocean to heat in other parts of Earth’s climate system. More than 90 percent of the warming that has happened on Earth over the past 50 years has occurred in the ocean.   estimate that warming of the upper oceans accounts for about 63 percent of the total increase in the amount of stored heat in the climate system from 1971 to 2010, and warming from 700 meters down to the ocean floor adds about another 30 percent. Annual ocean heat content compared to the 1993 average from 1993-2019, based on multiple data sets: surface to depths of 700 meters (2,300 feet) in shades of red, orange, and yellow; from 700-2,000 meters (6,650 feet) in shades of green and blue; and below 6,650 feet (2,000 meters) as a gray wedge. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, adapted from Figure 3.6 in State of the Climate in 2019. See original figure for details about data sources and uncertainty. Averaged over Earth's surface, the 1993–2022 heat-gain rates were 0.38 (±0.05) to 0.44 (±0.10) Watts per square meter for depths from 0–700 meters (down to 0.4 miles), depending on which research group's analysis you consult. Meanwhile, heat gain rates were 0.17 (±0.03) to 0.32 (±0.04) Watts per square meter for depths of 700–2,000 meters (0.4–1.2 miles). For depths between 2000–6000 meters (1.2–3.7 miles), the estimated increase was 0.07 (±0.03) Watts per square meter for the period from September 1992 to January 2013. According to the   report, “Summing the three layers (despite their slightly different time periods as given above), the full-depth ocean heat gain rate ranges from 0.64 W m  to 0.83 W m applied to Earth’s entire surface.”  Less than a watt per square meter might seem like a small change, but multiplied by the surface area of the ocean (more than 360 million square kilometers), that translates into an enormous global energy imbalance.  It means that while the atmosphere has been spared from the full extent of global warming for now, heat already stored in the ocean will eventually be released. That release of ocean heat would commit Earth to at least some additional warming in the future once greenhouse gas emissions stop. (The latest Earth system model simulations, however, find that at present levels of warming, this release of heat may be mostly balanced by the natural carbon cycle, which will begin incrementally reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels right away. If these models are correct, the amount of warming that can be expected once greenhouse gas emissions reach zero is at most a few tenths of a degree Celsius over a decade, and may be closer to zero.) In the present, warming of ocean water is raising global sea level because water expands when it warms. Combined with water from melting glaciers on land, the rising sea threatens natural ecosystems and human structures near coastlines around the world. Warming ocean waters are also implicated in the thinning of ice shelves and sea ice, both of which have further consequences for Earth’s climate system. Finally, warming ocean waters threaten marine ecosystems and human livelihoods. For example, warm waters jeopardize the health of corals, and in turn, the communities of marine life that depend upon them for shelter and food. Ultimately, people who depend upon marine fisheries for food and jobs may face negative impacts from the warming ocean.

Ice loss relative to 1970 for the glaciers in the World Glacier Monitoring Service's climate reference network.   is the annual balance between how much snow accumulates on a glacier and how much ice is lost through melting, sublimation (evaporation), or iceberg calving. Including the preliminary values for 2022/23, these glaciers have lost more than 26 meters of   which is roughly the same as slicing a 94-foot slab off the top of each glacier in the network. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from the  Glaciers that exist today are mostly remnants of the last ice age. Thick sheets of ice advanced and retreated across most continents several times before withdrawing to the polar regions about 10,000 years ago. Continent-scale ice sheets still cover Greenland and Antarctica, while smaller ice caps and glaciers retreated to the world's high latitudes and mountains. Roughly 20,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum of the Pleistocene Ice Age, ice spread over much of North America and Eurasia. (High-resolution without annotations  .) Image by Climate.gov based on data from the  , provided by  Originally, scientists began studying glaciers only for the clues they offered about Earth’s climate during past ice ages and the role they played in shaping the landscape. Today, they are also trying to understand how quickly human-caused climate change will cause them to disappear altogether.  Glaciers gain mass through snowfall and lose mass through melting and sublimation (when water evaporates directly from solid ice). Glaciers that terminate in a lake or the ocean also lose mass through iceberg calving. Those that end in the ocean are called tidewater glaciers, and they have more complex cycles of advance and retreat than glaciers that terminate on land, at least on annual and decades-long time scales. Even in a stable climate, such glaciers can experience periods of rapid retreat that are more influenced by seafloor topography and ocean circulation at their terminus than recent climate conditions. Retreat of   Muir Glacier between August 1941 and August 2004. Historically, Muir Glacier was an iceberg-calving, tidewater glacier. Its terminus was grounded in the waters of Muir Inlet, a narrow opening to Glacier Bay. In the six decades between the two photos, it has retreated so far that it's terminus is now inland. Photos from the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s   of repeat photography of glaciers. To see if a glacier is growing or shrinking, glacier experts check the condition of snow and ice at several locations on the glacier at the end of the melt season. The scientists check snow levels against stakes they’ve inserted in the glacier, dig snow pits in the surface to examine the sequence of seasonal layers, and insert long poles into the glacier to probe characteristics of the snow and ice. Generally, the difference in thickness of snow from the previous measurement indicates the glacier’s  —whether the glacier has grown or shrunk. Changes in the area and terminus of larger glaciers can also be tracked with satellite imagery. Scientists have described more than one hundred thousand glaciers in the World Glacier Inventory, but only a small fraction of these have been consistently monitored for long enough to measure climate-related changes in their size or mass. Scientists refer to this global collection of about 60 glaciers as \"climate reference\" glaciers. A given year's annual update will include 40 or so of the reference glaciers. (Not all glaciers are surveyed every year).  Photos documenting the disintegration of Italy’s Careser Glacier between 1933 (top) and 2012 (bottom). After decades of negative mass balance, glaciers worldwide are shrinking, fragmenting, or disappearing. Photos courtesy of Luca Carturan, University of Padova According to the WGMS, the most recent hydrological years (2021/22 and 2022/23) have each brought ice losses well above the average of even the past full decade (2010-2019). Observed reference glaciers experienced an ice loss of 1.1 meters of water equivalent and 1.2 meters of water equivalent, respectively. That's roughly 4 feet of ice off each glacier in the network each year. \"With this,\" they report on their website, \"seven out of the ten most negative mass-balance years have been recorded after 2010.\"  Tallying up each year's losses or gains through 2023, reference network glaciers have lost just over 26 feet of water equivalent relative to 1970—roughly the same as slicing an average of 28.6 meters (94 feet) off the top of each glacier.  In  , glacier expert Mauri Pelto reported that the pace of glacier loss in the WGMS reference network accelerated from -171 millimeters (6.7 inches) per year in the 1980s, to -460 millimeters (11 inches) per year in the 1990s, to -500 millimeters (1.6 feet) per year in the 2000s, to -889 millimeters (2.9 feet) per year for the 2010s. In many parts of the world—including the western United States, South America, China, and India—glaciers are frozen reservoirs that provide a reliable water supply each summer to hundreds of millions of people and the natural ecosystems on which they depend.

Argo floats descend and ascend through the top 2,000 meters of the ocean, collecting observations as they move.", "content": "A   Argo adrift in the icy waters of Antarctica's Weddell Sea in 2009. Photo provided by Olaf Boebel. There is a saying in climate science, “as the ocean goes, so goes the climate.” This phrase captures the notion that the ocean is, by far, the most powerful component and driver of the earth’s climate system. Yet the happenings in the ocean, especially below the surface, have been largely unknown for much of human history. Until the first deployment of Argo floats in 2000, less than 1 percent of the ocean below the upper few hundred meters was being monitored routinely. For a planet where oceans cover about 71 percent of the surface, that’s a lot of terra (or aqua) incognita. Enter the Argo float, which many consider the greatest leap in the climate observing system since the advent of satellites 50 years ago. An Argo float is an autonomous floating robot that alternately dives and ascends through the top 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) of the ocean, collecting climate observations as it goes. In 2007, the Argo program—an international collaboration involving more than 30 nations--achieved “full coverage,” defined as one float in every  3° x 3° square of ocean from 60°N and 60°S (outside of marginal seas).*  The current generation of floats are capable of operating under ice and in marginal seas.  Currently more than   of these smart buoys roam the global ocean. As of September 2014, a total of 3,579 floats patrolled the ocean. Most of the fleet drifts at depths from 750-1250 meters (0.46-0.78 miles) in order to avoid seamounts, but they profile down to depths of about 2,000 meters. Image adapted from  .   Argo floats have been “one of the biggest steps forward in understanding climate-scale changes in the ocean,” says Rick Lumpkin, an oceanographer with NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. “[The floats] provide a much more detailed view of seasonal to interannual [year-to-year] fluctuations of upper ocean heat and salt than we had before.” Argo floats do not care about weather, operating year-round in storm-tossed seas. They also provide observations in regions such as the southern hemisphere that are rarely visited by research vessels. Argo data has become pivotal to research into ocean heat storage, sea level rise, natural ocean variability, and many more topics. Nearly 300 papers utilizing Argo data were published in 2013. Steve Piotrowicz, director of the Argo program since 2000, commented that “anyone studying oceanography in grad school in the ‘70s, including myself, couldn’t have envisioned anything like this in terms of how we are now able to observe the ocean and the expansion of knowledge and scientific research going on,” he says. Jason and the Argonauts remained a popular subject during the Renaissance when Biagio d'Antonio painted this narrative canvas. Image courtesy  .   In Greek mythology, a ship named the Argo was used to transport Jason and the Argonauts in search of a golden fleece. The name Argo was chosen for the fleet of aquatic robots because they were the   to the   satellite, which monitors the ocean’s topography from 830 miles above the Earth’s surface. The quest of the modern-day Argo and Jason is to provide a comprehensive view of the ocean. There are more than two dozen   of the Argo floats but on average, the floats are about 5 feet long and weigh about 72 pounds. The main aluminum body is about 3.5 feet long and 8 inches in diameter, which is about the length of a baseball bat with a diameter about three times wider. The floats are powered by regular alkaline or lithium batteries that provide enough energy for the floats to complete, on average,   over roughly four years. A simple exterior hides the complex interior of an Argo float. Image courtesy  .   The floats are deployed into the ocean by ships or aircraft, where they immediately begin to sink at a rate of about 4 inches per second. The ability of the floats to move vertically is controlled by its hydraulic system, which controls buoyancy by adjusting the amount of oil in an external bladder. While descending, the float withdraws oil from the bladder into the instrument, increasing the density of the float and allowing it to sink lower and lower into the water. After about a six-hour descent, the floats drift along with the currents at a depth of 1000 meters (3280 feet) for ten* days. On day ten, the float then descends to a depth of 2000 meters (6560 feet). Its trip is much shorter, though. After reaching this depth, the external bladder is inflated with oil, causing the float to rise to the surface. Along the way, the instrument records a vertical profile of the ocean by taking measurements of temperature and salinity at different depths as it ascends. Each float is capable of capturing a time series of data containing as many as 1,000 data points for each oceanic parameter measured. This is equivalent to taking measurements every 6.5 feet. A typical float cycle includes descents to 1,000 then 2,000 meters before surfacing. Image adapted from NOAA's  .   After returning to the surface, Argo floats transmit the data of their 10-day journey to the next available satellite using the   or   communication system. The floats spend sufficient time at the surface to ensure error-free data transmission before diving to start the process all over again. As the quest for knowledge of the ocean increases, scientists are deploying new   for Argo floats to measure the oxygen content, ocean acidity, biogeochemical properties such as nitrates and chlorophyll and rainfall in the ocean. Other sensors under development are sensors measuring CO  and how far light penetrates the water column. In addition, a growing number of floats are equipped with the Iridium two-way communication system. This will reduce the time spent at the surface to as little as 30 minutes--avoiding the risk of getting caught in fishing nets and other obstacles at the surface--and accommodate greater data transmission. Scientists are particularly interested in using Argo observations to account for all the excess heat that has built up in the Earth’s climate system due to a build-up of greenhouse gases. Argo data has revealed that much of the heat is stored in the upper layers of the ocean, but not all of it. Researchers suspect that the rest is being stashed in the deep ocean. Unfortunately, the current generation of Argo floats can only dive to a depth of 2,000 meters; any deeper and -they would implode due to the extreme pressure in the deep ocean. But this past summer, for the first time, two next-generation Argo floats began their first trip to the bottom of the sea... Help us improve our content"},

August 2024 was again a very hot month in terms of mean global surface temperature, with this June-August period setting a global heat record. The global precipitation average also remained slightly above the August average, and as the El Niño to La Niña transition slowly continued, the tropical rainfall anomaly [difference from the long-term average] pattern began to resemble a more  . The mean precipitation analysis for August has the Asian monsoon with its usual swath of heavy rain across South Asia and also very intense Atlantic and Pacific  , along with the subtropical dry zones. The anomaly map [shown above] for the month has intense positive anomalies over parts of the Indian sub-continent and surrounding waters and eastward through Southeast Asia and Indonesia and out into the Pacific. To the north of that feature and roughly parallel to that feature, a dry zone is evident. The dry anomaly dominates in the mid-Pacific along the equator, although weakly. These features indicate a slightly larger La Niña effect on the precipitation patterns this month as one might expect with the   [sea surface temperature] index ending up  . Some of these positive anomalies were associated with flooding and landslide events in Bangladesh and northeast India (100 dead) and tropical cyclone activity alongside of Japan and even over Hawaii (Big Island), with 20” of rain (look closely in the anomaly map for the rainfall track). A little further east one can also see additional tropical cyclone tracks, with a negative anomaly to the south (somewhat La Niña-like), indicating the ITCZ in this area is located a little to the north than its usual position. On the other hand, the Atlantic ITCZ is located a little to the south of its normal position, and the eastern Atlantic was devoid of tropical systems in August. However, early in the month Hurricane Debby developed and provided copious rain for Cuba and along the East Coast of the U.S. for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina (up to 10”) and then over Pennsylvania and New York state (5”). South America is dominated by drier than normal areas for August, especially along the northern coast. North America is mostly covered by negative anomalies across the southern U.S. and northern Canada, with positive anomalies along the border between the two and along the aforementioned East Coast and Alaska. The rainfall regime over tropical Africa was active in August, with positive anomalies along its broad ITCZ and associated flooding in Nigeria and Sudan and even across the Red Sea in Yemen (100 dead).

A suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with typical particle size in the range of a few nanometers to several tens of micrometers. Aerosols have both natural and human-caused sources. Overall, they tend to produce cooling by scattering incoming radiation and by affecting cloud cover, although some aerosols can cause warming directly by absorbing radiation and indirectly through their interactions with clouds. The variety of life, including the number of plant and animal species, other life forms, genetic types, habitats, and biomes in an ecosystem.  The series of processes by which carbon compounds flow among reservoirs in the environment, such as the incorporation of carbon dioxide into living tissue by photosynthesis and its return to the atmosphere through respiration, the decay of dead organisms, and the burning of fossil fuels. In the carbon cycle, carbon flow or output from one reservoir transfers carbon to other reservoir(s). A naturally occurring gas, as well as a by-product of burning fossil fuels from fossil carbon deposits, burning biomass, land-use changes, and industrial processes (e.g., cement production). CO  is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas that affects Earth’s radiative balance. As the reference gas against which the radiative forcing of other greenhouse gases are measured, it has a global warming potential of 1. A set of techniques that aim to remove and/or sequester carbon dioxide (CO ) directly from the atmosphere by either increasing natural carbon sinks or using chemical engineering to remove the CO . Any process, activity, or mechanism that removes carbon from the atmosphere. A carbon sink may also refer to a physical location, defined area, or geological or biological element of Earth’s system (e.g., the ocean, a country, biomass) that stores acquired carbon from the atmosphere for a specified period of time.  The large-scale movement of waters in the ocean basin. It is a key regulator of climate by storing and transporting heat, carbon, nutrients and freshwater all around the world. (NASA, 2020) Climate  in a narrow sense, is usually defined as the average weather or, more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the average and variability of defining factors over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate, in a wider sense, is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.  Changes in average weather conditions that persist over multiple decades or longer. Climate change encompasses both increases and decreases in temperature, as well as shifts in precipitation, changes in frequency and location of severe weather events, and changes to other features of the climate system.  Within the United States, is the recognition of diverse values and past and ongoing harms, equitable distribution of benefits and risks, and the procedural inclusion of affected communities in decision-making processes.

A climate-literate person: A numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions, and feedback processes and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components, a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions; the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented; or the level at which empirical parameterizations are involved. Climate models are applied as a research tool to study and simulate long-term climate projections (decadal or longer) and operationally used to create shorter climate predictions (seasonal, annual, interannual).  The matter, energy, and processes involved in interactions among Earth’s atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and Earth-Sun interactions.

These parts include the physical, chemical, and biological processes that all interact to shape our planet and the organisms on it. Also known as climate anxiety, a chronic fear of environmental doom. A functional unit consisting of living organisms, their nonliving environment, and the interactions within and between them. The components included in a given ecosystem and its spatial boundaries depend on the purpose for which the ecosystem is defined. In some cases, ecosystem boundaries are relatively sharp, while in others they are diffuse, and they can change over time. Ecosystems are nested within other ecosystems, and their scale can range from very small to the entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems either contain people as key organisms, or they are influenced by the effects of human activities in their environment.  The release of climate-altering gases and aerosols into the atmosphere from human and natural sources.  Environmental actions, behaviors, laws, and policies that have not been fair, that have limited meaningful involvement in environmental decision-making, or have unjustly allocated the risks and benefits of environmental action across communities, most often based on race, color, national origin, income, and gender identity, among others. The principle of being fair and impartial and a basis for understanding how the impacts and responses to climate change, including costs and benefits, are distributed in and by society in more or less equal ways. Often aligned with ideas of equality, fairness, and justice and applied with respect to equity in the responsibility for, and distribution of, climate impacts and policies across society, generations, and gender, and in the sense of who participates and controls the processes of decision-making.  A weather event that is rare at a particular place and time of year, including, for example, heatwaves, cold waves, heavy rains, periods of drought and flooding, and severe storms. Definitions of “rare” vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10% or 90% probability density function estimated from observations. By definition, the characteristics of what is called extreme weather may vary from place to place in an absolute sense. Temperatures that are much hotter and/or humid than average. Because some places are hotter than others, this depends on what is considered average for a particular location at that time of year.

The increase in global surface temperature relative to a baseline reference period, averaging over a period sufficient to remove interannual variations (e.g., 20 or 30 years). A common choice for the baseline is 1850–1900 (the earliest period of reliable observations with sufficient geographic coverage), with more modern baselines used depending on the application.  The process through which heat is trapped near the Earth's surface by substances known as greenhouse gases. (NASA, 2024)  Gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of radiation emitted by Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, and ozone are the primary GHGs in Earth’s atmosphere. Other GHGs include sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons; several of these are also ozone-depleting (and are regulated under the Montreal Protocol). The potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems, and environmental resources.  A period of abnormally hot weather, often defined with reference to a relative temperature threshold, lasting from two days to months. Heatwaves and warm spells have various and, in some cases, overlapping definitions.  Occurs when sea level rise combines with local factors to push water levels above the normal high tide mark. Changes in prevailing winds, shifts in ocean currents, and strong tidal forces (which occur during full or new moons) can all cause high tide flooding, inundating streets and other infrastructure even on sunny days.

Created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the objective of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is to provide governments at all levels with scientific information that they can use to develop climate policies. The IPCC provides regular assessments of the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for adaptation and mitigation. IPCC reports are also a key input into international climate change negotiations. (IPCC, 2024)  A set of principles, processes and practices that aim to ensure that no people, workers, places, sectors, countries, or regions are left behind in the transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy. It stresses the need for targeted and proactive measures from governments, agencies, and authorities to ensure that any negative social, environmental, or economic impacts of economy-wide transitions are minimized, while benefits are maximized for those disproportionately affected. Key principles of just transitions include respect and dignity for vulnerable groups, fairness in energy access and use, social dialogue and democratic consultation with relevant stakeholders, the creation of decent jobs, social protection, and rights at work. Just transitions could include fairness in energy, land use, and climate planning and decision-making processes; economic diversification based on low-carbon investments; realistic training/retraining programs that lead to decent work; gender-specific policies that promote equitable outcomes; the fostering of international cooperation and coordinated multilateral actions; and the eradication of poverty. Lastly, just transitions may embody the redressing of past harms and perceived injustices. Occurs when actions are taken that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence. Community excluded from mainstream social, economic, educational, and/or cultural life. Examples of marginalized populations include, but are not limited to, groups excluded due to race, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, physical ability, language, and/or immigration status.  Movement of a person or a group of persons either across an international border or within a nation. It is a population movement encompassing any kind of movement of people, whatever its length, composition, and causes; it includes migration of refugees, displaced persons, economic migrants, and persons moving for other purposes, including family reunification.  Measures to reduce the amount and rate of future climate change by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases or removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The   was established by Presidential initiative in 1989 and mandated by Congress in the Global Change Research Act (GCRA) of 1990. Its mandate is to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.” The GCRA mandates that USGCRP prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a quadrennial assessment, referred to as the National Climate Assessment (NCA). (USGCRP, 2023) Actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems for the purpose of climate change mitigation. (USAID, 2022) Actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits.  Condition in which anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions are balanced by anthropogenic CO  removals over a specified period.  The process by which the pH measurement of ocean water moves toward more acidic levels due to the absorption of carbon dioxide, which interacts with ocean water to form carbonic acid, thereby lowering the pH. Increased acidity reduces the ability of plankton and shelled animals to form and maintain carbonate-containing body parts such as shells. Population or geographic location in the United States that experiences disproportionate environmental and climatic harms and risks. This disproportionality can be a result of greater vulnerability to environmental hazards, lack of opportunity for public participation, or other factors. Increased vulnerability may be attributable to an accumulation of negative or lack of positive environmental, health, economic, or social conditions within these populations or places. The term describes situations where multiple factors, including both environmental and socioeconomic stressors, may act cumulatively to affect health and the environment and contribute to persistent environmental health disparities.  An international climate agreement adopted in 2015, which entered into force in 2016, with the central goal of holding the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. Under this agreement, each party must, among other things, submit a “nationally determined contribution” (NDC)—that is, a greenhouse gas emissions target and/or mitigation policies and measures—every five years and regularly report on progress made in implementing and achieving its NDC. The agreement also addresses efforts to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and certain support for developing country Parties, such as financial support for mitigation and adaptation.  Approaches to research and planning in which those most directly impacted by the outcomes become active participants in the process. (Adapted from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2023) Any form of energy that is replenished by natural processes at a rate that equals or exceeds its rate of use. The capacity of interconnected social, economic, and ecological systems to cope with a climate change event, trend, or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity, and structure. Climate resilience is a subset of resilience against climate-induced or climate-related impacts. Threats to life, health, and safety, the environment, economic well-being, and other things of value. Risks are evaluated in terms of how likely they are to occur (probability) and the damages that would result if they did happen (consequences).  Increase to the height of sea level, both globally and locally (relative sea level change) due to a change in ocean volume as a result of a change in the mass of water in the ocean (e.g., due to melt of glaciers and ice sheets), changes in ocean volume as a result of changes in ocean water density (e.g., expansion under warmer conditions), changes in the shape of the ocean basins, and changes in Earth’s gravitational and rotational fields, as well as local subsidence or uplift of the land. Sea level change refers to sea level rise or sea level fall.  The institutions, policies, programs, practices, values, and behaviors that shape drivers, risks, impacts, and understanding of climate change. (Adapted from USGCRP, 2023: Ch. 20)  The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of the sea due to extreme meteorological conditions (low atmospheric pressure and/or strong winds). The storm surge is defined as being the excess above the level expected from the tidal variation alone at that time and place.  Adaptation that changes the fundamental attributes of a social–ecological system, often involving persistent, novel, and significant changes to institutions, behaviors, values, and/or technology in anticipation of climate change and its impacts. The point at which a change in the climate triggers a significant environmental event, which may be permanent, such as widespread bleaching of corals or the melting of very large ice sheets. An expression of the degree to which a quantity or process is unknown. In statistics, a term used to describe the range of possible values around a best estimate, sometimes expressed in terms of probability or likelihood. Uncertainty about the future climate arises from the complexity of the climate system and the ability of models to represent it, as well as the inability to predict the decisions that society will make. There also is uncertainty about how climate change, in combination with other stressors, will affect people and natural systems. A community who, due to continuous systemic discrimination, under- or disinvestments, and limited access to efficient, healthy, and affordable services and infrastructure, experiences disproportionate environmental and climatic harms and risks and lack access to adequate resources to mitigate, respond to, and recover from impacts. Increased vulnerability may be attributable to harmful environmental, health, economic, or social conditions—or to a lack of support for positive conditions—within these populations or places. The term describes situations where disproportionate vulnerability is often due to discrimination based on geography; access to authority or representation in governance; or social identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, culture, economic status, or ability.  A federal interagency research program established by Congress in the Global Change Research Act of 1990. Its mandate is to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.” ( , 2024) An international climate agreement adopted in 1992, which entered into force in 1994. The objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.  An organism, such as an insect, that transmits disease-causing microorganisms such as viruses or bacteria. Vector-borne diseases include, for example, malaria, Lyme disease, Zika, and chikungunya. The degree to which physical, biological, and socioeconomic systems are susceptible to and unable to cope with adverse impacts of climate change.  The state of the atmosphere, mainly with respect to its effects on life and human activities. As distinguished from climate, weather consists of short-term (minutes to days) variations in the atmosphere. Popularly, weather is thought of in terms of temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, visibility, and wind. A state of existence that fulfills various human needs, including material living conditions and quality of life, as well as the ability to pursue one’s goals, to thrive, and to feel satisfied with one’s life.

Glaciologists suspect that, for several decades before 1990, the Greenland Ice Sheet was neither gaining nor losing significant ice. Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow-On satellites have enabled scientists to better follow the ice sheet’s health. The observations show steady decline. Adapted from the  (ARC), this graph shows monthly changes in Greenland ice mass over April 2002–April 2020. The 2017–2018 segment without data results from the gap between the GRACE missions. The background is a NASA satellite image of a Greenland fjord. Between September 2018 and August 2019, the Greenland Ice Sheet set a record for ice loss (532 ± 58 billion metric tons). Between September 2019 and August 2020, the rate of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet was much lower (293 ± 66 billion metric tons), but still above the 2002–2020 average measured by GRACE. Average ice loss for Greenland over the full 18-year record was 268 ± 14 billion metric tons per year. Greenland ice loss in 2019 was enough to raise global ocean level by 0.06 inches (1.5 millimeters). That amount might seem small, but Twila Moon, lead author of the ARC Greenland Ice Sheet chapter explains that it is just one source of rising seas, supplemented by others, “and that's simply a single year of addition.” Cumulative sea level rise is already harming coastal infrastructure around the globe, and the impacts will worsen into the future. “Some places, for example, the U.S. Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard, will see more sea level rise than other places in the world.” Lower melt rates over September 2019–August 2020 resulted partly from unusual atmospheric circulation centered over Greenland. The circulation caused lower summer surface air temperatures relative to the previous year. Over the same period, ice sheet albedo—reflectivity of sunlight from the ice sheet surface—was above average over most of the ice sheet. When ice reflects more light, it melts less. Moon cautions that the more muted melt in 2020 doesn’t signal a return to normal conditions. She says, “The Greenland Ice Sheet has lost ice every year now since 1998. Any ice loss is not helpful for maintaining the ice sheet. Even small years of ice loss add up.” Moon, T.A., Tedesco, M., Box, J.E., Cappelen, J., Fausto, R.S., Fettweis, X., Korsgasard, N.J., Loomis, B., Mankoff, K.D., Mote, T., Reijmer, C.H., Smeets, C.J.P.P., van As, D., van de Wal, R.S.W.

NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from  The Arctic Oscillation (AO) refers to an atmospheric circulation pattern over the mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The most obvious reflection of the phase of this oscillation is the north-to-south location of the storm-steering, mid-latitude jet stream. Thus, the AO can have a strong influence on weather and climate in major population centers in North America, Europe, and Asia, especially during winter. Winter surface pressure across the Northern Hemisphere compared to the 1981-2010 average when the Arctic Oscillation (AO) was strongly negative (top, 2009-10) and when it was strongly positive (bottom, 1988-89). The negative AO favors a warm Arctic and cool conditions across the U.S. and Europe. The positive phase favors a cool Arctic and relatively warm conditions in the mid-latitudes. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from the Physical Sciences Lab. The AO's positive phase is characterized by lower-than-average air pressure over the Arctic paired with higher-than-average pressure over the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The jet stream is farther north than average under these conditions, and storms can be shifted northward of their usual paths. Thus, the mid-latitudes of North America, Europe, Siberia, and East Asia generally see fewer cold air outbreaks than usual during the positive phase of the AO. Conversely, AO's negative phase has higher-than-average air pressure over the Arctic region and lower-than-average pressure over the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The jet stream shifts toward the equator under these conditions, so the globe-encircling river of air is south of its average position. Consequently, locations in the mid-latitudes are more likely to experience outbreaks of frigid, polar air during winters when the AO is negative. In New England, for example, higher frequencies of coastal storms known as \"Nor'easters\" are linked to AO's negative phase. AO phases are analogous to the Southern Hemisphere's Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), a similar pattern of air pressure and jet stream anomalies in the Southern Hemisphere. Viewed from above either pole, these patterns show a characteristic ring-shape or \"annular\" pattern; thus, AO and AAO are also referred to as the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM), respectively.  and   values for the Arctic Oscillation Index are available from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. \nThompson, D.W.J., S.

In climate monitoring, we often use the term “outcome” to describe the results of a season. For example, “For most of the United States, seasonal outcomes during spring 2012 included a record-warm March and a record-warm spring.” Outcomes in climate—like in life—are a combination of factors. And at certain times of year—like certain times in life—different factors emerge as relatively more important to an outcome. In climate, spring dampness is one of those factors that emerges as important for warm season outcomes, particularly for the interior of the continent. The Sun shines down on a flooded cornfield near Orrick, Missouri, on June 6, 2015. When the ground is wet from spring rains, the summer Sun has to evaporate the water before the ground really srtarts to heat up. Photo by Vincent Parsons,  . Used under a  . This week, we’ll go   to examine how spring precipitation influences summer temperatures, and why this matters a little more in land-locked areas. Flyover Country, from one of your native sons, this blog’s for you. The punchline of this blog is pretty straightforward: for much of the interior United States, the precipitation you get in the late spring can make a difference in temperature outcomes for the summer. Here’s some background: in the summer, because the sun is high in the sky and days are long, the Earth’s surface (that’s where we live) absorbs a heck of a lot of energy. The amount of moisture in the soil can control how much of that incoming energy goes into raising the surface temperature (“sensible heat”) and how much goes into evaporating water (“latent heat”). As you might guess, and have probably experienced, drier soils mean more sensible heating and less latent heating, which means higher temperatures. This is the “dry oven” scenario - almost all of that incoming energy is devoted to making the temperature go up. With wet soils, temperatures stay lower as more energy is consumed by the process of evaporating water. This is the “steam bath” scenario—the temperature stays lower, but there’s more water vapor added to the air. Folks in the southern plains saw the “dry oven” scenario in spades in the spring and summer of 2011. During the spring, while the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers saw epic flooding, Texas and Oklahoma were dry—  dry. Most of the region racked up more than half a foot of rainfall deficits during the April-June period, which is the wettest stretch of a normal year. Precipitation for April-June 2011 compared to the twentieth-century average. The Southern Plains and Gulf Coast were much drier than average (brown), while the Upper Mississippi and Ohio Valleys were wet (green). NOAA NCEI map by Deke Arndt. By the end of summer, the region was not only mired in drought, but it was colossally hot. Oklahoma and Texas ended up in a neck-and-neck race for the hottest summer for any state on record, passing up some legendary competition. In the meantime, the waterlogged Ohio Valley stood out as a near-normal exception within a larger field of warmer-than-normal conditions. Temperature for June-August 2011 compared to the twentieth-century average. The Southern Plains and Gulf Coast were much hotter than average (red). The spring wetness in the Ohio Valley probably helped keep the temperatures in the Ohio Valley closer to normal (white). NOAA NCEI map by Deke Arndt. So, I’ve identified a pattern, a relationship between spring precipitation and summer heat. Climate scientists call that sort of pattern a “signal” (as opposed to just weather and climate “noise.”) But if you’re wondering how widespread the signal is…the answer is not very. The map just below shows the strength of relationship between late-spring rainfall (June, to be precise), and summer temperature. This map shows the correlation between June rainfall and the June-August temperature over the span of the historical record (1895-2015). Places where June rainfall explained less than 5% of the year-to-year variability in summer temperatures are colored light purple. Darkest purple shows places where June precipitation accounted for 25% of more of the variability in summer temperature. Map by Deke Arndt. A few key points can be made: \tThere’s also more of the darker shading (stronger connection) towards the interior of the continent. It’s not a perfect match, but in general, the oceans have a moderating effect on both temperature and precipitation. Away from the oceans, in the nation’s heartland—again, all things being equal (and, again, they’re usually not!)—local summer temperatures outcomes can take on the shape of recent rainfall history. The spring 2016 wetness in the nation’s heartland may be worth watching. If that pattern holds for the next couple of weeks, and if we get locked into a summer doldrums situation, temperatures in those areas may be a little lower than the neighboring regions. Indeed, the Climate Prediction Center noted soil moisture as one factor (of several) that led to a lower probability of a warm summer in the region relative to the  Thanks for going "},

Recent cold air outbreaks over the north-central and northwestern U.S., along with record cold on Veterans Day in parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, should have people excited about (or dreading) the upcoming winter. My colleagues and I at the Climate Prediction Center have just issued   for the upcoming “meteorological winter,” that is, December through February. Right now, our official outlook covers only temperature and total precipitation, with the latter combining both liquid and frozen precipitation. However, what about the frozen stuff? What about snow? Because many people remember winters that were either exceptionally snowy or not snowy at all, we get a lot of questions about what the winter forecast portends for seasonal snowfall accumulation. In many parts of the country, snowfall also has major economic and societal ramifications, including water resource management and winter tourism, among others. Tackling this problem is not easy, though. Part of the issue boils down to the technical difficulties of snowfall measurements—a real   as Deke Arndt (NCEI) puts it. The other issue is related to the difficulties with prediction. As many people in the Northeast corridor are aware, snowfall with any given storm system is a function of the dreaded rain-snow line that separates air masses that are below or above freezing. For any given storm system, the exact boundaries between rain and snow can be hard to predict even days in advance. Luckily, at CPC, we aren’t trying to predict specific events, but the climate instead. We take a step back and see how   temperature and precipitation forecasts might play a role in determining   snowfall accumulation. In regions that receive a large percentage of their cold-season precipitation in the form of snow, increased seasonal precipitation is intuitively related to increased snowfall accumulation. In more temperate areas that receive a relatively small percentage of frozen precipitation, temperature becomes important. Anomalously cold temperatures are, more or less, a necessary condition for snow in those areas. Therefore, a region with a relatively cold winter may find itself on the cold side of storm systems more often. In more mountainous areas, where temperature varies as a function of elevation, colder systems result in snow falling at lower altitudes and more total snowfall coverage over a given region. This is where the long-term warming trends, recently  , become important over western North America. Drier and warmer climate signals will generally result in lower snow coverage. Because a   was recently issued, we will take a look at how La Niña, in general, affects snowfall across North America. This analysis is part of a broader effort at CPC to better understand and potentially predict seasonal snowfall, made possible in part by a new snowfall dataset (1). In a nutshell, La Niña is associated with a   Ocean. The retreat of the jet stream results in more blocking high pressure systems that allow colder air to spill into western and central Canada and parts of the northern contiguous U.S. At the same time, storm track activity across the southern tier of the U.S. is diminished under upper-level high pressure, which also favors  . The storm track is in turn shifted northward across parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes (2). Based on climate analysis (3) from this new snow dataset, we see that La Niña favors increased snowfall over the Northwest and northern Rockies, as well as in the upper Midwest Great Lakes region. Reduced snowfall is observed over parts of the central-southern Plains, Southwest, and mid-Atlantic. Snowfall departure from average for all La Niña winters (1950-2009). Blue shading shows where snowfall is greater than average and brown shows where snowfall is less than average. Climate.gov figure based on analysis at CPC using  .  This La Niña footprint is pretty intuitive. Given the northward shift of the storm track, relatively cold and wet conditions are favored over the northern Rockies and northern Plains, resulting in the enhancement of snowfall. Warmer and drier winters are more likely during La Niña over more southern states, and this is exactly where seasonal snowfall tends to be reduced (4). The more vigorous storm track and slight tilt toward colder temperatures over the northern tier of U.S. during La Niña modestly increases the chance of a relatively snowy winter. We can break up the snow pattern further and look at the weakest and strongest La Niña events. Splitting La Niña events into strength reveals some interesting differences worth investigating further. In this preliminary analysis below, there is a suggestion that weaker events are snowier over the Northeast and northern and central Plains on average.  Snowfall departure from average for weaker La Niña winters (1950-2009). Blue shading shows where snowfall is greater than average and brown shows where snowfall is less than average. Climate.gov figure based on analysis at CPC using  .  On the other hand, stronger La Niña events (see below) are snowier across the Northwest, northern Rockies, western Canada, and the Alaska panhandle. Also, there is a tendency toward below average snowfall over the mid-Atlantic, New England, and northern and central Plains, which is not seen during weak La Niña. Snowfall departure from average for stronger La Niña winters (1950-2009). Blue shading shows where snowfall is greater than average and brown shows where snowfall is less than average. Climate.gov figure based on analysis at CPC using  .  Overall, stronger La Niña events exert more influence on the winter climate pattern over western North America. Weaker events appear to be associated with more widespread above-average snow over the northern United States. Because a weak La Niña means that the forcing from the Pacific is weaker than normal, it may imply other mechanisms (e.g. Arctic Oscillation) may be at play and is worth further investigation. The predictability of seasonal snowfall may be somewhat similar to precipitation in that one or two big events can dramatically affect the seasonal average. Thus, in general, the expected prediction skill is likely to be lower than for temperature. However, because temperature also plays an important role in snowfall, some predictability is likely nonetheless. And like for seasonal temperature and precipitation, knowing the state of ENSO is a pretty reasonable place to start. (1) This new dataset is documented in   “Creation and Validation of a Comprehensive 1° by 1° Daily Gridded North American Dataset for 1900-2009: Snowfall” in the  . The dataset for this analysis goes up to 2009, so we are going to look at winters from 1950-51 to 2008-09. Total cold season snowfall accumulation from October through April is used here. (2) This is consistent with the temperature pattern: the storm track is enhanced where the temperature gradient is stronger than normal. (3) Here we are using composite analysis to show snowfall. In this case we take just the La Niña years between 1950-51 and 2008-09 and compute the mean. For the strength composites, we divide the 18 La Niña winters between 1951-2009 into weak or strong cases. The   used to split them is -0.95°C during December-February (DJF) average. We need to be cautious drawing too many conclusions based on the large reduction in our sample size. Composites also emphasize variance: regions with more year-to-year variability will have higher amplitude composite signals. (4) The areas in the South that favor below-average snowfall during La Niña are most evident where the snowfall climatology is reasonably high. That is where the signal is most likely to come through the noise.

The tropical Pacific is still in neutral, but nature continues giving us signs that La Niña is on the way, and our   remains. Forecasters estimate a   that La Niña will emerge during September–November and expect it will persist through the Northern Hemisphere winter. A weak La Niña is the most likely scenario. While there are no plot twists since  —frequent readers could be forgiven for fast-forwarding this month’s update—that 71% chance of La Niña developing this autumn is a small upward tick. Also, the slower-than-expected development of La Niña is a great example of how the short-term (subseasonal) and very long-term (climate change) complicate seasonal outlooks. I’ll run the numbers in a minute, after a word from our sponsor. ENSO forecasters get their information from two general areas:   and current observed conditions in the ocean and atmosphere. Climate models are up first, today. (See footnote.)

The gray shading shows the range of temperatures predicted by individual models that are part of the North American Multi Model Ensemble (NMME, for short). Most of the shading appears below the dashed blue line by the fall, meaning most models predict that temperature in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific will be cooler than average by at least 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit)—the La Niña threshold. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data provided by Climate Prediction Center.  The North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) is a collection of computer models that take information about current global conditions and apply physical equations to make predictions about upcoming weather and climate. For more about the NMME, check out   and   from our friends at Seasoned Chaos. This set of climate models has been predicting the development of La Niña since last winter, and continues to do so, although it’s taking a little longer than initially expected. This isn’t particularly surprising, since   are often less accurate than predictions made at other times of the year. Overall, though, the models’ prediction of La Niña this upcoming winter has been consistent, including from   to this month, providing continued confidence in the forecast despite the slowdown. Time to check in with a few of our favorite characters. Our primary metric for ENSO, the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean in the  , was about 0.1 °C cooler than the long-term average (long-term = 1991–2020) in August, according to the  . This is solidly neutral—the La Niña threshold is 0.5 °C cooler than average—and only a small drop from July. 2-year history of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for all strong El Niño events since 1950 (gray lines) and the recent (2023-24) event (purple line). Five of the eight gray lines dip below the dashed blue line (the La Niña threshold) in the winter following the El Niño. The 2023-24 event appears headed in the same direction. Graph by Emily Becker based on monthly Niño-3.4 index data   using  . The winds over the tropical Pacific play an important role in ENSO’s dramatic arc. When the near-surface winds in the tropics—the trade winds—are stronger, they cool the surface and keep warmer water piled up in the far western Pacific. They can also trigger an upwelling  , an area of cooler-than-average water under the surface that moves from west to east. Throughout August, the trade winds were stronger than average across most of the tropical Pacific, helping to maintain the gradual surface cooling tendency and to bolster the amount of cooler water under the surface. This cooler subsurface water will provide a source to the surface over the next few months. Beneath the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean at the equator, a deep pool of cooler-than-average (blue) waters has been building up over the past couple of months (July 12–Sept. 5, 2024). This pool of relatively cool water is a key factor behind the prediction for La Niña later this fall and winter. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on analysis from Michelle L'Heureux, Climate Prediction Center.  We started this La Niña Watch party back in  . Looking back at that forecast, the probability of La Niña developing by June–August was about 55%, with about a 42% chance of ENSO-neutral during that period. These probabilities mean that La Niña’s development in June–August was favored, but there was still a good chance that neutral would linger. As it turned out, the June–August average sea surface temperature in the Niño-3.4 region, the “ ,” was 0.1 °C below average, in the neutral range. So why is La Niña behind schedule? Honestly, nature is wild and crazy and it amazes me that we can predict anything ever, especially many months in advance. In this case, though, there are a couple of complicating factors we can point to. The first is our old frenemy, short-term  , or, essentially, unpredictable weather events that complicate seasonal or longer predictions. For example, just a few periods of weaker trade winds can delay surface cooling.  Unfortunately,   is an ongoing challenge, and currently we can only predict these trade wind fluctuations a week or so in advance. On the other side of the timeline, we have climate change. The   are still way above average, and they are   over the next several months. We don’t yet have a   of how global warming may affect ENSO in general, or the development of La Niña this year in specific. That said, the most likely outcome is still that La Niña will be in place this winter, with slightly greater than 80% chance of La Niña in November–January, probably a weaker event (see strength probabilities  ). Out of the three climate possibilities—La Niña, El Niño, and neutral—forecasts say that neutral conditions are the most likely for the August–October season (tall gray bar above the ASO label, slightly over 60 percent chance). By the September-November (SON) season, La Niña has the highest chance of occurring (blue bar, 71 percent chance). NOAA Climate Prediction Center image.   A weak La Niña wouldn’t play as large a part in steering global atmospheric circulation patterns, meaning a lower chance of   on winter conditions. However, even a weak La Niña can nudge the winter climate and would likely factor into CPC’s  . Stay tuned here for recaps and predictions about your favorite program, ENSO!     There are two kinds of prediction models, dynamical and statistical. The model information I discuss in this post is from dynamical models. Statistical models use historical observations and their relationships to predict how conditions might evolve. Statistical models do not use physical equations, but rather statistical formulations that produce forecasts based on a long history of past observations of sea surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, subsurface temperature, and others. Statistical models have been around longer than dynamical models, because the dynamical ones require high performance computers.    but this came up from years ago. I looked up the PDO in December 1917, and the PDO was a negative 0.52. La Nina was in place in the Tropical Pacific. I read that was the coldest and Snowiest begin to Winter 1917 - 18 that was ever recorded in the CONUS. Interesting that in January 1918 the PDO was a positive 0.42. Apparently, low readings in the PDO plus La Nina was responsible for the very harsh Winter 1917 - 18. I also looked up the AMO (AMV) and from 1880, and has been slowly climbing from that year to now. The AMO in 1917 - 18 was strongly negative and now strongly positive and the PDO is a negative 2.88. Appreciate any thoughts on this scenario.

Submitted by   on Tue, 10/08/2024 - 12:39 There currently is a very warm large blob of water west of 180 in the North Pacific. If this warm SST blob persists, could it affect our weather? Submitted by   on Tue, 10/08/2024 - 13:11 That's a good question. On one hand, many studies have struggled to find robust impacts of extratropical sea surface temperature anomalies on midlatitude weather (unlike tropical sea surface temperature anomalies that directly impact atmospheric convection and midlatitude  ). On the other hand, there have been some indications that North Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies, especially in connection with the Kuroshio-Oyashio extension, could have some impact on our weather. For example,   led by one of my postdocs suggests that a warm North Pacific like what we see now is associated with enhanced North Pacific atmospheric blocking, which impacts North American weather.

Weather geeks love to look at the overall SST patterns in the Pacific other than ENSO and compare them to prior years SSTs to come up with a winter forecast. I've always felt that was a bit of folly. Submitted by   on Wed, 10/09/2024 - 14:19 In reply to   by  Yeah, there's a reason why we focus on ENSO in this blog and why seasonal forecasts from dynamical models usually resemble the typical ENSO impacts (with the addition of the trend for temperature) - the impacts of other sea surface temperature patterns tend to be minor. However, that doesn't mean that the impacts of these other patterns are always negligible, and it doesn't mean that our models aren't missing something important. The bottom line, though, is that the atmospheric response to tropical sea surface temperature anomalies, especially from ENSO, is often the dominant seasonal forecast signal.  Submitted by   on Wed, 10/09/2024 - 20:38 In reply to   by "},

A number can mean a lot or very little depending on how it is being used, and who is using it. To a Taylor Swift fan,  . To many in Western cultures, it is a day of bad luck when falling on a Friday. To others, 13 is just the number that comes after 12. When it comes to climate science and policy, one of our “13s” is the 1.5°C climate threshold, shorthand for global average surface warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. That’s the level of warming that the countries who signed the Paris Agreement have agreed to try to stay below. But what does pre-industrial mean? How do we know when we’ve passed 1.5°C? And what happens if we do? The Industrial Revolution transformed the textile industry in England. This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain,  When you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to  . The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That   represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44°C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century. For the 1.5°C climate threshold, the “average” time range is defined as the “pre-industrial period”, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this “pre-industrial period?” It depends. Most history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of   typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that’s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define   as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1) While there can be differences in what counts as “pre-industrial”, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2) How far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define  . For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20t -century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI. Adding to the nuance,   itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don’t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive. Suffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures. So, when you come across stories about the 1.5°C threshold—especially if you think you’re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven’t reached 1.5°C— you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the “pre-industrial” time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information. Let’s go back in time before large international climate conferences like   existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2°C.  As the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When   was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize “greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need “to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2°C above preindustrial levels”. However, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at   than 2°C of warming. So in 2015, nearly the entire world (195 nations) came together at the United Nations-held international climate meeting COP21 to sign the  . This landmark treaty explicitly states that the world’s nations pledged to “hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels,” recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. The relevance of this temperature threshold was explored even more in the   In that report, and further supported by subsequent IPCC reports and other scientific literature, they found that limiting global warming to 1.5°C will reduce the impacts on human systems and terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems. It made clear that every increment of global warming above 1.5°C matters for the scope and magnitude of these impacts.  Remember, passing this threshold as defined in the Paris Agreement is supposed to reflect when human-caused global warming   exceeds 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial times. That is NOT simply when average global temperatures pass that mark on any given day, month, or even year. To know when Earth has passed that threshold, we have to look at longer timescales. Why? Let’s look at a recent example. Global surface temperatures in September, October, and November 2023 exceeded 1.5°C above the pre-industrial period. Does that mean the Paris Agreement has failed? No! Global surface temperatures can be influenced not only by human-caused climate change, but also by natural climate factors like El Niño and random weather. When combined, these factors can briefly push monthly or even yearly global temperatures above 1.5°C; that doesn’t mean 1.5°C is the new normal. Human-induced warming (blue shading) reached approximately 1°C above pre-industrial levels in 2017. At the present rate, global temperatures would reach 1.5°C around 2040. Stylized 1.5°C pathway shown here (green shading) involves emission reductions beginning immediately, and CO  emissions reaching zero by 2055. Graphic appears in FAQ 1.2 in the   supplement to the  IPCC Special Report on  Instead, we need to average the temperature anomalies over a period of time like 20 to 30 years. Averaging helps to smooth away any of the rough edges caused by natural warming factors and better reveals the long-term trend. That is why it can be said at the same time that global temperatures have reached 1.1°C above the pre-industrial in 2011-2020 (according to the IPCC 6  assessment report), and that global temperatures in September 2023 were 1.5C above the pre-industrial. It's also important to note that the Paris Agreement does not specify how many years should make up this long-term trend, which dataset should be used, and which time period makes up the pre-industrial period. That means different scientists, governments and groups might come to different conclusions about when Earth passes this critical threshold. Absolutely not. Millions of people globally are already experiencing impacts of climate change in the form of extreme temperatures, heavy rains, flooding, and more. The 1.5°C climate threshold is not a light switch that turns on all sorts of climate calamities. For every little bit of additional warming, the risk of negative impacts gets worse. So why did the Paris Agreement define the global temperature target of 1.5°C? Because both models and paleoclimate data show that beyond 1.5°C, the risk of severe impacts to some ecosystems and locations—including places where people are least responsible for the problem—become larger than the world as a whole was willing to accept. Urgent action in this decade is essential for trying to minimize these impacts. Temperature change is not uniform across the globe. Projected changes are shown for the average temperature of the annual hottest day (top) and the annual coldest night (bottom) with 1.5°C of global warming (left) and 2°C of global warming (right) compared to pre-industrial levels. Graphic appears in FAQ 3.1 in the   supplement to the  IPCC Special Report on  The 1.5°C limit is sort of like a highway speed limit. Backed by plenty of science about the dangers of speeding, we know that every bit of additional speed increases the danger of an accident. There is no single speed below which the risks are zero and above which (within reason) an accident is guaranteed to occur or to be deadly. Still, we pick a limit beyond which the risks become larger than we are willing to tolerate. (Footnote 3) Our best bet as drivers and human beings affecting the climate is to not push our luck, especially when some of consequences—societal, economic, or ecological—could be dire. Looking at what models predict for the near term (next 9 months), monthly global temperatures look to remain quite warm through the beginning of 2024 before beginning to fall from that perch as the calendar shifts into spring. This is consistent with how we know El Niño impacts global temperatures; this period coincides with the forecasted weakening of the current El Niño. (Footnote 4) Monthly average temperatures (red dots and line) rose to more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average in late 2023. On average, forecasts from the North American Multi-model Ensemble (NMME) system indicate temperatures are likely to decline a bit—though remaining quite warm from a historical perspective—as the strong Niño currently underway begins to fade in early 2024. NOAA Climate.gov graph based on data from NCEI and Emily Becker/IRI. In May 2023, the World Meteorological Organization forecasted that annual global temperatures were predicted to have a   of exceeding 1.5°C for at least 1 year between 2023-2027 (Footnote 2). This is consistent with how we expect continued global warming to affect temperature trends over multi-year time periods and the likelihood for a strong El Niño to supercharge warming in a given year. So when will we   reach 1.5°C? According to the  : “In the considered scenarios and modeled pathways, the best estimates of the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term (2021-2040).” And global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low greenhouse gas emission scenarios. That means we not only have no time to lose in reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions, but that we should also be thinking about how to make the things that matter to us, from our communities to our natural resources, better able to withstand—at the very least—that level of warming. 1) Before 2023, NOAA used 1880-1900. Once NOAA’s dataset was extended back to 1850, so did the pre-industrial time period. 2) Paleorecords help us extend even farther back which is one way in determining just how much current warming differs from natural patterns 3) This monthly global surface temperature forecast was provided by Emily Becker and comes from the North American multi-model ensemble (NMME) model members that were available on January 8.

El Niño is zipping along in the tropical Pacific. There’s a   that this El Niño event will end up “historically strong” (more details below), potentially ranking in the top 5 on record. Looking ahead, it’s likely that El Niño will end and neutral conditions return by April­–June. El Niño is associated with specific changes to weather and climate around the world, and the stronger an El Niño, the more likely we are to see those impacts. Of course, nothing is ever guaranteed when it comes to our complex Earth system, and the unpredictable effect of chaos may interrupt the expected impacts. For an excellent, in-depth explanation of why a strong El Niño provides the best information for making seasonal predictions, and yet weather can still upend those predictions, check out  . Map of sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean compared to the long-term average in November 2023. The waters in the key monitoring region, which scientists call \"the Niño-3.4 region,\" are much warmer than average (red), illustrating the strong El Niño. NOAA Climate.gov, based on Coral Reef Watch maps available from  Our primary metric for the strength of an ENSO event (ENSO = El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the whole El Niño and La Niña system) is the three-month-average temperature of the central tropical Pacific Ocean, specifically in the Niño-3.4 region. The temperature anomaly—the difference from the long-term average, where long-term is currently 1991–2020—in this region is called the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI). We use a three-month average because ENSO is a seasonal phenomenon, meaning it persists for at least several months. We don’t have official strength definitions, but, unofficially, an ONI anomaly of 1.5 °C or warmer is considered a strong El Niño, with 2.0 °C the threshold for “very strong” or “historically strong.” 2-year history of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for all events evolving into El Niño since 1950 (gray lines) and the current event (purple line). NOAA Climate.gov image based on a graph by Emily Becker and monthly Niño-3.4 index data   using  . The most recent ONI anomaly, for  , was 1.8 °C. November, what I’m showing here in this graph, was 2.0 °C. Many of our   predict that it will hang out at or above 2.0 °C long enough to achieve “historically strong” status. The El Niño events in our   (starting in 1950) with the largest Oceanic Niño Index values are 1972–73 (2.1 °C), 1982–83 (2.2 °C), 1997–98 (2.4 °C), and 2015–16 (2.6 °C). Maybe you’re wondering if the fact that those numbers are in increasing order means that El Niño is getting stronger overall? It probably is not. First, I’ve only picked out the very strongest El Niño winters from the 25 in our record, and there are plenty of weaker events sprinkled in. Also, it’s very unlikely that this event will top 2.5 °C, which would break the pattern. Instead, the gradual rise in the strongest ONI anomalies is more likely a sign that that some influence from global warming remains in the Oceanic Niño Index, even though   it by using a rolling 30-year period as our long-term average. For more on this complication, as well as a possible solution, check out Michelle’s post “  She also has  , written with colleagues at the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia, that gives details on an alternative ENSO index.  El Niño is more than sea surface temperature, though. The atmospheric component is just as important, as the atmospheric circulation above the tropical Pacific—the  —responds to the changes in the ocean surface temperature and helps to reinforce them. This   is critical to ENSO. In the case of El Niño, the warmer-than-average central and/or eastern tropical Pacific leads to more rising air and storms over that region, less over Indonesia, and weaker-than-average upper-level winds and near-surface winds (the trade winds). Overall, this means a weaker Walker circulation. Outgoing long-wave radiation anomaly from November 11 - December 6, 2023. Regions with more clouds and rain than average are shown in blue; areas with fewer clouds and less rain are shown in orange. Climate.gov image from CPC data. So how is the atmosphere looking, with our current strong, possibly on its way to very strong, El Niño? Looking at the map above, we see a pretty clear signal over the past 30 days of more clouds over the central Pacific (purple, showing that less surface radiation is escaping to space, because it’s being blocked by clouds) and less over Indonesia (orange, where more radiation is making it to the satellites, because there are fewer clouds). There are a few other ways of measuring the atmospheric response. The Southern Oscillation Index compares the surface pressure in Tahiti to that in Darwin, Australia. When the pressure is lower than average in Tahiti and higher than average in Darwin (a negative index), it is an indication that the Walker circulation is weakened. In November, this index was -0.8. The Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is another measure of pressure patterns across the tropical Pacific, specifically the average over the western Pacific versus the average over the eastern Pacific. As with the original Southern Oscillation Index, a negative Equatorial SOI shows that the Walker circulation is weaker than average. November 2023 was -1.3.  For context, this means the atmospheric signal is approximately in the top third of all El Niño events for this time of year. Location of the stations used for the Southern Oscillation Index (Tahiti and Darwin, black dots), the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index (eastern equatorial Pacific and Indonesia regions, outlined in blue-green), and the Niño3.4 region in the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean for sea surface temperature (red dashed line). NOAA Climate.gov image by Fiona Martin. Why do we have   that sound like they measure the same thing? The Southern Oscillation Index extends back to 1866, but only measures the pressure at two specific stations, meaning it is more susceptible to short-term weather fluctuations. The Equatorial SOI record starts in 1950, same as our well-observed sea surface temperature record, and measures the average over two very large geographic regions. The larger areas mean that the Equatorial SOI is more resistant to the variability caused by random storms influencing a certain location, etc. Near the equator, the steady, east-to-west trade winds usually keep warm water piled up in the far western Pacific. When they slow, this warm water can slosh eastward under the surface as a  .

Graph by climate.gov from CPC data. There were some pretty strong “westerly wind bursts,” what we call it when the trade winds slow, during November. These events kicked off a  , increasing the amount of warm water under the surface of the Pacific. The amount of warm water is still lagging behind what it was during the strongest events on record, as I discussed in  , but it’s a solid source of warm water that will continue to feed the surface over the next few months.

Blue bars show the chances of La Niña, gray bars the chances for neutral, and red bars the chances for El Niño. Graph by Michelle L'Heureux. What goes up must come down! Our current thinking is that neutral conditions are most likely to develop by April­–June. Then… what’s that blue bar lurking on the right side?? La Niña and neutral are nearly even odds for July­–September, with El Niño a distant third. Most, but not all, of the stronger El Niño events in our historical record were followed by La Niña, so that would not be unusual. We’ll be back with more information when we get back from climbing Everest… I mean, next month!     Thanks, very interesting! Submitted by   on Thu, 12/14/2023 - 22:55 These are all very interesting data points and the author seems to take several liberties in analyzing and interpretation. It overlooks key climate indicators and fails to address the nuanced interactions that actually contribute to the phenomenon. A more comprehensive examination, considering factors like celestial hydroflux dynamics, ionospheric resonance, coupled with the Milankovitch cycles and the Beinhoff scale of temperature variances in the upper equatorial altitudes, would provide a more accurate portrayal of the complex processes involved in a strong, or super strong, El Nino.   Submitted by   on Fri, 12/15/2023 - 10:00 \" celestial hydroflux dynamics\" and \"Beinhoff scale\" do not show up in any Google Scholar search Submitted by   on Fri, 12/22/2023 - 00:52 In reply to   by  In response to the critique of the original analysis, it's imperative to consider the complexities of climatological phenomena through a multifaceted lens. The critique overlooks the fundamental principles of Thermolunar Vibroscopy, a pivotal concept in understanding celestial impacts on climate patterns. Furthermore, the interaction of Photonic Wind Shear with the Earth's Magnetohydrodynamic Permeability offers a substantial explanatory framework for the anomalies observed during strong El Niño events. Additionally, the critique fails to recognize the significance of Quantum Atmospheric Synchronicity, a leading-edge concept that bridges the gap between microscale meteorological events and macroscale atmospheric dynamics. This is particularly crucial when considering the role of Substratospheric Vapor Induction in global weather patterns. Moreover, the integration of Gravitational Wave Flux Analysis, a technique that has revolutionized our understanding of cosmic influences on Earth's climate, provides critical insights that should not be dismissed. This methodology, combined with the principles of Neoplasmaic Particle Distribution in the troposphere, offers a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate dynamics at play. In summary, while the original analysis may seem unconventional, it's grounded in a series of advanced, albeit theoretical, scientific concepts that merit further exploration and validation within the scientific community. Submitted by   on Wed, 01/03/2024 - 04:48 In reply to   by  I've seen through decades (including one time CPC forecaster) too many contradictions between El Nino/La Nina based expectations to take seriously any specific time period. Most explicit example was last year's extreme rain/snow/flooding through California totally inconsistent with designated La Nina period. But right on with El Nino expectations including the southern jet. In my opinion forecasts based on La Nina/El Nino are an exercise in futility and invoked when nothing else to go with. BTW: The mean current atmospheric circulation over US/Canada is not El Nino like and expected southern El Nino jet has yet to appear.

Your broader point (that the influence of El Niño and La Niña can be and often are overwhelmed by other atmospheric actors), that's a reality our bloggers don't shy away from discussing. NOAA's seasonal forecasts aren't based solely on some kind of ENSO binary, in which forecasters decide in the fall that El Niño is here and then take the rest of the winter off. This blog has always been straightforward about the limits of  seasonal forecasts in general, as well as the limits of ENSO as influence on those forecasts. But over the years, we have also provided plenty of evidence that suggests your statement about \"futility\" is an exaggeration. Simple statistics show that there are locations in the U.S. that are more likely to have wet/dry/warm/cool winters during El Niño and La Niña. Sure, we can debate exactly how reliable a signal would need to be in order to be useful for a given purpose, but its just not \"fair\" (i.e. consistent with the data) to say that ENSO has   utility for seasonal forecasting.

However, there are 2 questions I'm sure a few folks interested in the current ENSO phase share: - After an unexpected three-peat La Niña, that stunningly, did not bring typical cooler ocean & air temps to the planet, what are the probabilistic indicators suggesting this current El Niño phase is likely to exhaust itself by April, potentially transitioning back to (ahem) \"cool\" La Niña? - J. Hansen published an interesting note in a mid-December Columbia U piece that touches on ENSO, specifically to dispel the notion the El Niño phase is a causal driver of global warming.  By looking strictly at the Nino 3.4 Pacific region Sea Surface Temp anomaly, Hansen and his colleagues maintain the 2016 and this 2024 El Niño are successively   events than the massive 1998 event.  This is confusing given that many other credible sources say 2016 was / 2024 will be as \"big\" as 1998.  So will 2024 be a big one, or is something else going on here?  I.E. is the planet so warm that ENSO as an indicator of \"warm\" / \"cool\" years, is out the window, so to speak?  Cheers & Happy New Year to all!   Submitted by   on Thu, 01/04/2024 - 01:05 It's an interesting read and I did learn a few things.  Some of the comments were entertaining as well.  What I've learned to count on regarding weather forecasting is two things:  1.  My window, and 2.  My weather rock. There is always a 100% chance of weather. Submitted by   on Thu, 01/04/2024 - 11:09 Any ideas on why El Nino has not resulted in the usual precipitation impacts to California thus far? Submitted by   on Thu, 01/04/2024 - 12:03 I've heard that the rainy season in parts of Central America has not yet ended, even though it's normally over by now (with December also normally dry).   So, does El Niño have any influence on this?  If so, what? Submitted by   on Mon, 01/08/2024 - 18:41 El Niño tens to influence the climate in Central America more in the summer and fall and is related to drier than average conditions. So it's not impossible that El Nino is playing a part here, but it's not a direct connection to the extended rainy season in Central America. Submitted by   on Tue, 01/09/2024 - 11:41 In reply to   by  Thanks for the response. That said, I was still really curious about this topic after posting my question, so I did a web search about it (search term: efectos de El Niño en Costa Rica).  And, by looking at trustworthy sites, I got an answer:  During El Niño, the trade winds across the Caribbean get stronger, which results in the Caribbean coast getting more rainfall and the Pacific coast being drier.  From looking at NOAA satellite images, it looks like this is what is happening, especially in Costa Rica and Panama (as well as Nicaragua). I know that El Niño is just one factor with this, and that there are others (such as global warming and the MJO) that are probably influencing this.  But, I thought it was interesting, so I figured I'd share it with you. Submitted by   on Tue, 01/09/2024 - 16:05 In reply to   by  Thanks for sharing! I am aware that El Nino tends to bring wetter conditions to the southern US and much of Mexico due to the extension of the subtropical jet, and drier conditions to the south (like Costa Rica), but I was not aware of some of the possible more localized impacts over the region.  Submitted by   on Wed, 01/10/2024 - 17:10 In reply to   by  2023 had a mixed response not associated only to El Niño. Our Caribbean coast experienced a severe drought, much greater than that one of the Pacific, which is not usual during El Niño, and even less so during a strong El Niño. Certainly, the extraordinary warming in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean played a key roles in this year's climate variability. Submitted by   on Thu, 01/11/2024 - 17:26 In reply to   by  Hi. Further proof that El Niño is not the only driver of climate variability in this region, look at the SSt in the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic.

Red areas were warmer than average, and blue areas were cooler than average. The darker the color, the larger the difference from the long-term average. White and very light areas were near average. [ .]  Warmer-than-average sea surface temperature across the central and eastern tropical Pacific is one of the indicators of El Niño conditions. El Niño is the name for the warm phase of a major climate pattern called the El Niño Southern Oscillation ( ). Conversely, cooler-than-average sea surface temperature across this region is one indicator of La Niña conditions. La Niña is the name for the cool phase of ENSO. These monthly measurements are made from NOAA's   sea surface temperature (SST) data. Every day, instruments on eight satellites in two different orbits (geostationary and polar) measure sea surface temperature by checking how much energy is radiated by the ocean at different wavelengths. Computer programs plot these measurements on a gridded map and then merge and smooth the data into a gap-free product using mathematical filters. Each grid point covers an area approximately 5 x 5 km. Daily temperatures at each grid point are averaged together to calculate monthly average temperature.  To calculate the difference-from-average temperatures shown here, a computer program takes the monthly average temperature at each grid point, and subtracts the long-term average for that month. If the result is a positive number, the sea surface was warmer than the long-term average. A negative result from the subtraction means the sea surface was cooler than usual. Shades of blue show locations where sea surface temperature was cooler than its long-term average. Locations shown in shades of orange and red are where the sea’s surface was warmer than the long-term average. The darker the shade of red or blue, the larger the difference from the long-term average or “usual” sea surface temperature. Locations that are white or very light show where sea surface temperature was the same as or very close to its long-term average. Water covers more than 70% of our planet's surface. Tracking the temperature of the sea’s surface helps scientists understand how much heat energy is in the ocean and how it changes over time. In the tropical Pacific Ocean, differences from normal sea surface temperatures serve as one of the major indicators as to whether ENSO is in an El Niño or La Niña phase.  These phases can have dramatic impacts on weather across the tropics and the mid-latitudes. Sea surface temperature anomalies give scientists a way to monitor the evolution of ENSO phases, enabling them to predict potential impacts in the Pacific region and around the world weeks in advance. Data Snapshots are derivatives of existing data products: to meet the needs of a broad audience, we present the source data in a simplified visual style. NOAA's Environmental Visualization Laboratory (NNVL) produces the Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly files.

This is late for La Niña to arrive, and it’s very likely to be a weak event at most. However, even a weak event can influence temperature, rain, and snow patterns across the world. El Niño and La Niña are the warm and cool phases of a natural climate pattern across the tropical Pacific known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or “ENSO” for short. The pattern shifts back and forth irregularly every two to seven years, bringing predictable changes in ocean temperature and disrupting the normal wind and rainfall patterns across the tropics. These changes in the seasonal climate of the world's biggest ocean have a cascade of global side effects. La Niña intensifies the normal circulation of the atmosphere over the tropical Pacific Ocean. These changes have \"side effects\" on weather patterns downstream in the U.S. Among the most reliable impacts is drier-than-average winters across the southern part of the country. El Niño and La Niña have weaker impacts during Northern Hemisphere summer than they do in winter. Summer impacts include warm conditions in northeastern Australia and cooler than average conditions across India and Southeast Asia. On the second Thursday of each month, scientists with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center in collaboration with forecasters at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) release an official update on the status of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

The tropical Pacific sure knows how to get out of a rut! Just two months after   of an almost interminable La Niña, above-average surface temperatures have reclaimed the tropical Pacific, and temperatures in the central-eastern Pacific are expected to continue to rise. Consequently, an   remains in place, with El Niño conditions likely to develop within the next couple of months and then persisting ( ) into the winter. We care about the potential development of El Niño—the warm phase of   (El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the whole El Niño-La Niña system)—because of the   that arise from its occurrence, including the expected temperature and precipitation patterns shown  . We’ll revisit many of these impacts in the coming months, but we’ll start by focusing on all the details of these rapidly developing conditions in the tropical Pacific. According to   (our most consistent historical dataset), the April average sea surface temperature in the   (our primary monitoring region for ENSO) was 0.1 °C above the long-term (1991–2020) average. This value is up 0.2 °C from March and is the first time the monthly Niño-3.4 temperature was warmer than average since April of 2020. 16-month history of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for all events evolving into El Niño since 1950 (gray lines) and the current event (purple line). NOAA Climate.gov image based on a graph by Michelle L’Heureux and monthly Niño-3.4 index data   using  . When we zoom into the weekly time frame, we find that the latest   from our highest-resolution dataset ( ) was 0.4 °C above the long-term average, even higher than the latest monthly average. This is just a mere 0.1 °C away from the 0.5 °C threshold that is   for declaring El Niño conditions. Subsurface ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific also  , providing a source of warmer water that can sustain a developing El Niño. How can La Niña seem like a distant memory so quickly? Although the tropical Pacific Ocean looks ready to burst through that door to El Niño, the tropical atmosphere seems a bit more hesitant, remaining firmly in ENSO-neutral territory. As in March, the April   and the   were close to zero, indicating that the   remains at near-average strength. For El Niño conditions, we would expect negative values of these  , which would indicate (1) a weakening in the surface pressure difference that normally exists between the western and central-eastern Pacific and (2) a reduction of the east-to-west surface trade winds that are the key component of the Walker circulation. (For La Niña conditions, we get the opposite – positive index values indicating a strengthened Walker circulation and stronger east-to-west trade winds across the tropical Pacific Ocean.) Summary of NOAA decision process in determining El Niño conditions. NOAA Climate.gov drawing by Glen Becker and Fiona Martin. Note that even if the monthly average Niño-3.4 index soon exceeds the 0.5 °C threshold for El Niño, forecasters will not declare onset of El Niño unless the tropical atmosphere is clearly responding in the expected way, including a weakening of the Walker circulation. Forecasters have high confidence in an upcoming El Niño not only because of the rapidly changing tropical Pacific Ocean conditions but also because of the strong agreement from the latest computer model predictions. The current forecast from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble ( ), a set of state-of-the-art computer climate models, indicates that the Niño-3.4 sea surface temperature is very likely to climb above the El Niño threshold within a couple of months and remain in El Niño territory for the remainder of the forecast period.

The black line shows the model forecast average; darker gray envelope shows the range of 68% of all model forecasts; lighter gray shows the range of 95% of all model forecasts.

Additionally, we’ve pushed one more month through the dreaded   (also check out  ,  , and Michelle’s latest post  ). Taken together, these signals have allowed forecasters to increase their forecast confidence this month, with the likelihood of El Niño approaching 90% by summer and exceeding 90% through next fall and winter.

Blue bars show the chances of La Niña, gray bars the chances for neutral, and red bars the chances for El Niño. Graph by Michelle L'Heureux. The possibility of a significant El Niño is also growing. Following the method described in  , the   for a strong El Niño (Niño-3.4 index greater than 1.5 °C) is approximately 55%, which is up almost 15% since last month. We may have a better handle on the potential strength of this event, assuming it develops (still a 5-10% chance it doesn’t!), once we fully get past the spring predictability barrier. Warm ocean conditions are not just limited to the tropical Pacific. Despite some   ocean temperatures off the West Coast of the U.S., the remarkably warm global ocean has grabbed    . April 2023 sea surface temperature difference from the 1985-1993 average (details from  . Most of the global oceans were warmer than average.

Dr. Huang kindly provided the following plots of near-globally averaged sea surface temperature time series for two of our most used sea surface temperature datasets, monthly ERSSTv5 and daily OISSTv2.1. Non-polar (60 °N – 60 °S) global averaged sea surface temperature from 1982-2023 from (top) daily   and (bottom) monthly   datasets. The thick black lines represent the 1982-2011 average across the calendar year; 2022 (orange line), 2023 (thick red line), and 2016 (the year of record warmth before 2023; thin red line) are highlighted. The thin grey lines represent all other years. The top graph indicates that 2023 reached record warm levels since mid-March in OISST; however, the bottom graph indicates that peak temperatures in ERSST have not clearly exceeded the record warmth of March 2016 in that dataset. Nevertheless, both datasets indicate that April 2023 was warmer than any previous April on record. NOAA Climate.gov image based on graphs by Boyin Huang and data from  . First, we note that while the two datasets are not identical, as   way back when, both the ERSST and OISST datasets confirm that the global oceans are currently sizzling. However, they do have minor disagreements about  . Although the global (non-polar) ocean surface temperatures have been warmer than at any point over the past 40 years in the OISST dataset since mid-March, the ERSST dataset has trailed the record warmth of 2016, at least until recently. However, Dr. Huang confirms a point of agreement: both datasets indicate that the global ocean surface was warmer in April 2023 than in any previous April. How would a developing El Niño relate to the global ocean temperatures? First, as Emily noted last month,   than in La Niña or ENSO-neutral years. Given how warm the oceans are already, a developing El Niño would only increase the chance of record-breaking global ocean temperatures (and global average temperature over both ocean and land), which likely would have important ecological consequences, including for fish and  . Another factor to consider is that the widespread ocean warmth may make it a little more challenging for the warm temperatures in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific to induce a tropical atmospheric response (maybe a reason for the current ENSO-neutral looking tropical atmosphere?). The reason is that the response of the tropical atmosphere depends on surface temperatures in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific  . If those surrounding tropical regions are also warmer than average, then the bar is even higher for the Niño-3.4 region surface temperature anomalies to induce an atmospheric response (see footnote). The bottom line is that in terms of a push on the tropical atmosphere, we need to consider that the Niño-3.4 index may punch below its weight while it’s hovering in borderline El Niño territory, as it is now. However, if the central-eastern Pacific continues to warm up, we can expect that the atmosphere will feel that push eventually. You probably noticed that you aren’t being treated to the ENSO update eloquence that Emily usually provides each month. Don’t worry – Emily will be back later this month with a post talking about our favorite blend of computer prediction models, the NMME. Also, be sure to check out NOAA’s outlook for the 2023 hurricane season that comes out in just a couple weeks (May 25th). One of biggest implications of a developing El Niño in the shorter term is its potential influence on the  . In brief, Atlantic hurricane seasons tend to be less active during El Niño, while the Pacific season is often enhanced. That means this month’s ENSO forecast is likely one of the factors that will be considered in the hurricane outlook. In the meantime, keep your eyes peeled on the tropics, and don’t blink – conditions are evolving quickly!

I say die El Niño before September Submitted by   on Mon, 05/22/2023 - 09:32 In reply to   by  I always appreciate the great ENSO blog for its interesting content! I am currently wondering whether the unusually cold ocean temperatures off the West Coast of the U.S., reminiscent of a negative phase of Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM), may inhibit the development of El Nino as the negative PMM induces easterly anomalies (or impairs westerly anomalies) in the tropical Pacific. If this is the case, the El Nino conditions may grow less than expected. Submitted by   on Thu, 05/11/2023 - 17:35 Great observation! The PMM is certainly not in a phase that would be conducive to El Ninos and it extends enough to the tropics that it could have some bearing on Nino3.4.  This is one of those wildcard factors the contribute to that 5-10% chance of no El Nino developing along with a weaker strength event if one does form. Submitted by   on Fri, 05/12/2023 - 09:55 In reply to   by  Great post and thanks for the cool and descriptive analysis. You mention RONI, what about MEI? I’ve always thought a multivariate approach a good one for defining ENSO phase. Thanks again! Submitted by   on Thu, 05/11/2023 - 20:26 Great question Greg!  So the MEI is a perfectly valid ENSO index for certain applications but in operations, we prefer indices that are also provided at monthly mean resolution (the ONI can be split into  monthly Nino3.4 index values which can be used in real time declaration).  Also, as we mention in this  , it can be difficult to dynamically understand what is going on when using combined indices like the MEI.  It is useful to us to see the OLR index by itself, the SOI index by itself, etc, etc.  When the indices are all combined, we can't rule out that one variable is dominating the rest (Example: SSTs are consistent with El Nino, but none of the other atmospheric indices are participating).   Further, the   have a lot of investment and time put into climate homogenization meaning we can, fairly confidently, compare today's value with one in the past (at least since the 1950s).  I can't say the same about gridded datasets of winds, etc.   And, lastly, SST trends are   and we probably need this to be addressed for SST variables in the MEI as well.  Hope that helps.

Submitted by   on Mon, 05/29/2023 - 23:01 Thanks for the blog.  I find it very informative.  I have a question though.  In this post you state that El Niño often leads to higher air surface temperatures, which would lead to higher sea surface temperatures.  You reference an earlier post, which gives the reason for the increase in air surface temperatures.  As I understood it, the reason for higher surface temps during El Niño was due to higher evaporation off the ocean, leading to increased transfer of latent heat from the ocean to the atmosphere.  In other words, we're transferring more heat from ocean to atmosphere during El Niño.   My question is how can the SST be expected to go up during El Niño when the latent heat flux out of the ocean is expected to be higher?  Does that mean the conductive transfer of heat in from the atmosphere outweighs the increased advective latent heat flux out?  I'm not a climate scientist, and I'm not doing the calculation right now, but I would usually predict that advective latent heat flux moves more heat than conduction.  In addition, during El Niño, the higher evaporation leads to more cloud formation, which also reduces the radiant heat influx to the ocean.  So, from my simplistic understanding, I see that during El Niño we have increased heat advective heat flux out of the ocean, and reduced radiant heat flux in to the ocean.  So, I'm having a hard time seeing how El Niño would result in an increased global SST.  I guess I would intuitively predict the opposite. Submitted by   on Tue, 05/30/2023 - 08:18 That's a good question, and I understand how this can be confusing. It's true that an increase in the latent heat flux out of the ocean should lead to   of the ocean surface, not a warming. It's important to recognize that in the main \"action center\" of El Nino in the tropical Pacific, the heating is driven by the transport of ocean heat through the \"Bjerknes feedback,\" as described in  . The cooling influence of the increased evaporation (as well as that of the cloud shading) is a  that offsets the warming, but it's not strong enough to overcome the warming influence the Bjerknes feedback. Outside of the main Pacific action center, there isn't a significant change in evaporation to compete with the atmospheric warming that spreads away from the central-eastern Pacific.  Submitted by   on Tue, 05/30/2023 - 19:29 In reply to   by  I have a farm in the highlands of Central Mexico and the impacts of ENSO on our drought-prone region are obviously very important, but also extremely unclear. I have been studying the historic charts for ENSO and it just isn't obvious how our rainfall is impacted. Right now El Niño is forecast to bring us drought. But it seems to me - and I am not at all a scientist - there are too many other factors to make a clear prognosis. This makes life very difficult to plan our farms. In our region, campesino farmers rely on the monsoon rains that start in May-June and run through October more or less. Right now, in June, we are having a drought. Hotter and drier, the monsoon rains are not in the forecast at all. We should be planting now but the ground is totally dry. But we are in a Neutral phase now, which in the past has not been a problem. So obviously there are other factors at play. I just wonder, with the climate being so complex, and climate change playing havoc with the whole system, if it is possible at all to really make helpful forecasts that allow farmers to prepare for their season.  Submitted by   on Sat, 06/03/2023 - 11:02 I can empathize with the struggle you describe. Unfortunately, the ENSO signal doesn't always stand out among all competing factors, and often times those competing factors are more difficult to predict than ENSO months or seasons in advance. However, I still believe that the ENSO signal is strong enough to provide some guidance to farmers, as suggested in   from a couple of years ago.  In addition to checking the charts related to past ENSO episodes, I might suggest checking some forecast maps from state-of-the-art seasonal forecast models, like from the NMME ( and   maps). As you can see from those links, you can get both spatial maps of anomalies (like for precipitation) and model skill, so you have an idea how reliable the models are. These forecasts can complement the ENSO-related guidance, so you could see if the models are consistent with expected ENSO impacts, if there may be some other signal that the models are seeing, or if the models are inconsistent/unskillful for the region, lead time, and variable of interest.  Submitted by   on Sat, 06/03/2023 - 22:42 In reply to   by "},

This value is 0.15°C (0.27°F) more than the previous record set in 2016. The 10 warmest years in the 174-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2014–2023). Of note, the year 2005, which was the first year to set a new global temperature record in the 21st century, is now the 12th-warmest year on record.

ENSO not only affects global weather patterns, but it also affects global temperatures. As seen in the image below, during the warm phase of ENSO (El Niño), global temperatures tend to be warmer than ENSO-neutral or La Niña years, while global temperatures tend to be slightly cooler during cold phase ENSO episodes (La Niña).

The National Weather Service issued  , which are warnings reserved for exceedingly rare situations in which extreme rainfall is leading to a severe threat to life and catastrophic damage. During the  , mudslides washed out roads, streets were inundated with flood waters, and swift-water rescues were necessary. The highest 24-hour rainfall totals were 14.83 inches and 13.5 inches near Oxford, Connecticut. Both values are under   by a State Climate Extremes Committee to determine if either location officially broke the 24-hour state rainfall record for Connecticut.

More than 10 inches of rain was reported by a National Weather Service employee near Sound Beach, qualifying as a 1-in-200-year rainfall event. This was not the first extreme rainfall event to happen across the Northeast this summer. There have been at least three other extreme rainfall events that have produced at least one 1-in-200-year rainfall event, two of which were associated with the remnants of   and  . The third was an extreme rainfall event across northeastern Vermont on July 30, which resulted in at least two 1-in-500-year rainfall events. Every extreme rain event has a variety of causes and influences; increasingly human-caused climate change is one them. According to the   (NCA5), precipitation across the Northeast is increasing across all seasons, and extreme precipitation events have increased nearly 60 percent in the region–the largest increase in the United States. The report states that some of these changes may in part be due to tropical systems, but also note that there is more overall water availability (in the air) throughout the region due to warming temperatures (warmer air is able to hold onto more water). The four charts show the number of daily events per year with precipitation totals equal to or exceeding 2, 3, 4, and 5 inches from 1958–2022 (blue lines), along with trend lines (black) computed from linear regressions over the full period. Numbers in the top left corner show the percent increase relative to the long-term average, computed as the difference between the end points of the trend lines divided by the 1958–2022 average. The number of daily events is defined as the total number of extreme precipitation accumulations recorded at all stations across the observing network in the Northeast. See the figure metadata for details on the methodology. The trends shown suggest an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation, with larger increases for the more extreme precipitation events. Figure adapted from  The blue lines in the graphs above show the number of days per year in the Northeast with extreme precipitation. The trend lines (black) show the overall increase in frequency of these extreme precipitation days over the last several decades, with even larger increases for more extreme precipitation events. Extreme precipitation events of all sizes are occurring more often now across the Northeast, and the scales are tipped even   toward the highest-end precipitation events—those that tend to have large impacts on people, lives, and property. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased across much of the United States, particularly the eastern part of the continental US, with implications for flood risk and infrastructure planning. Maps show observed changes in three measures of extreme precipitation: (a) total precipitation falling on the heaviest 1% of days from 1958–2021. Numbers in black circles depict percent changes at the regional level. Data were not available for the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands and the US Virgin Islands. Image adapted from  NCA5 also concluded that there is “robust evidence that human-caused warming has contributed to increases in the frequency and severity of the heaviest precipitation events across nearly 70% of the U.S.” The report also states paleoclimate records indicate that summer moisture has increased over the past century in parts of New England, the central-eastern United States, and the northern Mississippi River Valley.

You’ll have to excuse this ENSO Blogger for a minute while I drink some sweet tea on the porch and lament about all the heat and humidity, “Woof, it’s hot!” Things truly seem to move slower during the dog days of summer in late July and early August. And it seems like the El Niño/Southern Oscillation ( ), a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific Ocean that can affect weather across the world, is no exception. The expected transition from ENSO-Neutral to La Niña continues to proceed slowly, as if the whole Pacific is stuck in a summer daze, moving as slow as molasses. According to the August  , ENSO-Neutral conditions remain across the Pacific, with La Niña favored to develop during Autumn (66% chance) before persisting through the Northern Hemisphere winter (74% chance during November-January). Out of the three climate possibilities—La Niña, El Niño, and neutral—forecasts say that neutral conditions are the most likely for the July-September season (tall gray bar above the JAS label, over 80 percent chance). By the September-November (SON) season, La Niña has the highest chance of occurring (blue bar, above 65 percent chance).

First, a reminder that El Niño and La Niña are opposite phases of ENSO.   occurs when the water in the eastern and central tropical Pacific is warmer than average, while La Niña occurs when the water is cooler than average. That change in water temperature can jumble up the   causing a   The end result is shifts in the   and changes in weather patterns, often leading to wild weather including floods, droughts, and heatwaves. But unlike other climate phenomena which can be difficult to predict even two weeks prior, the phase of ENSO   many months in advance, giving communities worldwide vital time to prepare. ENSO-Neutral, meanwhile, simply reflects that ocean temperatures are near-average, with little unusual impacts on the atmosphere above it. The last month has seen near-average sea surface temperatures across most of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, so we are squarely ENSO-Neutral. The Niño-3.4 region of the Pacific, which is  , was 0.1°C warmer than the long-term average from 1991-2020, according to ERSSTv5, our most reliable   Yep, I did say “warmer.” So let’s dive deeper into the Pacific for the reason we are still forecasting the development of La Niña (eventually) this year. While sea surface temperatures are currently perfectly  , below-average water temperatures in the subsurface (the surface to 300 meters below the surface) of the tropical Pacific Ocean strengthened in the past month, expanding across more of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. These cooler-than-average waters will be one of the driving forces behind any La Niña that forms later this year. Beneath the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean at the equator, a deep pool of cooler-than-average (blue) waters has been building up throughout the summer to date (June 7-August 1, 2024). This pool of relatively cool water is a key factor behind the prediction for La Niña later this fall and winter. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on analysis from Michelle L'Heureux, Climate Prediction Center.  Meanwhile, for as interesting as the ocean has been, the atmosphere has been the opposite. The trade winds were slightly more easterly than normal in July (which reflects slightly stronger-than-average trade winds), while thunderstorm activity was generally near-average. A pretty clear reflection of ENSO-Neutral. Let’s talk about the forecast. So far this summer, the climate models we use for guidance have been trending toward a weaker and delayed development of La Niña than they first hinted in the spring. In May and June, the models forecasted a start during summer. But the most recent forecasts pinpoint early fall as the most likely start time. Regardless, the overall model consensus remains that La Niña will likely form this year and last through the upcoming winter. Line graph showing observed and predicted temperatures (black line) in the key ENSO-monitoring region of the tropical Pacific from winter 2023-24 though winter 2024-25. The gray shading shows the range temperatures predicted by individual models that are part of the North American Multi Model Ensemble (NMME, for short). Most of the shading appears below the dashed blue line by the fall, meaning most models predict that temperature in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific will be cooler than average by at least 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit)—the La Niña threshold. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data provided by Climate Prediction Center.  This fact, combined with current observations of cooler-than-average water at depth across the Pacific and slightly enhanced trade winds, give forecasters confidence that even though the transition to La Niña has been slower than initially expected, it’s still likely to form later this year. The burning-hot, must-be-suffering-from-heat-exhaustion-at-this-point elephant in the room continues to be the hot streak Earth has been going through for more than a year (as well as the longer warming trend associated with human-caused climate change). Global ocean temperatures have been record breaking every month for well over a year. And just as we noted some uncertainty on how this would affect the 2023-24 El Niño (RIP), the same goes for any developing La Niña. Daily surface temperatures for the global oceans between 60˚ North and South from 1981-2024 to date. From April of 2023 (orange line) through May 2024 (red line) temperatures were not only been much warmer than the 1981-2010 average (thick blue-green line), but record warm by a wide margin compared to all other years (thin blue-green lines).

This overall heat brings me back to   Michelle wrote a few years ago describing the   Oceanic Niño Index, which takes the temperature anomaly in the Niño3.4 region and subtracts the anomaly for the entire tropics. This helps to shine a clearer light on the local regions of relative warming or cooling across the Pacific, which is directly tied to increased or decreased tropical rainfall. While it is not  , it is a newer index that the team monitors on the side.  Said more simply, it’s not   how much warmer or colder than average that part of the tropical Pacific is that jumbles up the tropical atmosphere, it’s the   in warming or cooling compared the rest of the Pacific. And that’s where the relative ONI comes in! So where do things stand? The regular ONI for May-July was +0.2°C. But the relative ONI was already down to -0.4°C. That means there could be a scenario later this year where the ONI is not yet below -0.5°C, but the   ONI already is, and the atmosphere might start reflecting La Niña-like impacts. Doesn’t that seem like a pain to communicate? Tell me about it! Luckily for me, if that does happen it will be Emily’s job to communicate it all when she’s back writing the monthly outlook posts next month. Sorry, Emily. The NMME plots for August look a lot like the NMME plots for July. Seems on the plots the CFSv2 is the outlier and most of the models are somewhere in between .5 and 1 around .75. Seems the CPC/IRI plots are about the same.  The NMME seasonal outlook for winter looks alot like a La Nina seasonal precipitation map where the drier and wetter areas of the US look like. The Temperature outlook is interesting. The chart looks like almost the entire continental US will experience above average temperatures during winter according to the NMME. What do you think about all this?  Submitted by   on Thu, 08/08/2024 - 15:18 Most models still have La Nina forming so it makes sense that the precipitation signal for winter reflects La Nina-like conditions. Climate models tend to latch onto that signal as it's the most predictable at this early a stage.   As for temperature, NMME still shows a colder than average signal across Canada for DJF and generally around average for the northern tier, so that signal is still there just not pushed as far south.

How fast that will occur is one of the big unknowns for predicting the pace of sea level rise over the rest of the century. Glacier experts think the ice sheet was likely in balance in the decades leading up to 1990, but since then, it has been losing mass at an accelerating pace. Adapted from the 2019 Arctic Report Card, this graph shows month-to-month changes in Greenland ice mass from April 2002–April 2019 overlaid on a NASA satellite image of the northwest coast of the island (rotated counterclockwise about 90 degrees) from July 19, 2019. Each peak in the graph shows the snow mass gained during the winter; each valley shows summer losses through surface melting and glacier thinning and retreat. The 17-year trend is estimated to be -267±3 billion tons per year, which is enough to have raised sea level by nearly 12 millimeters (0.5 inches).  In the satellite image, sapphire blue melt ponds and streams are visible along the low elevations of the ice sheet margin which appears gray where snow has melted and   is exposed. Surface melting in summer 2019 was unusually widespread and early, according to the Arctic Report Card, starting in mid-April, 6-8 weeks sooner than average.  Under high pressure and sunny skies, roughly 95 percent of the surface experienced melting at some point in the summer, well above the 1981-2010 average of about 64 percent, equivalent to the previous record set in 2012. The highest one-day melt extent was 60.9 percent on July 31. Around the northern margin of the island, the melt season lasted at least 20 days longer than average. Based on   combining observations and models since 1948, the exceptionally early and widespread melt in 2019 is likely to have led to the biggest one-year ice mass loss on record for the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Each year the annual   report examines the physical changes happening to our climate system. One of the main reasons we monitor these changes is because they can affect life on Earth—plants, animals, and us.

Changes in the physical climate system have cascading effects on the surrounding environment and those that dwell there. The effects may be temporary or permanent. While impacts are happening around the world, the most dramatic are occurring in areas where climate change is happening more quickly or in places where some combination of natural variability and climate change may have collided to produce extreme warmth. In the 2015 edition of the   report, climate and biology experts wrote about some dramatic impacts of warming on life in the ocean. In the western Antarctic Peninsula region of the Bellinghausen Sea, temperatures are rapidly warming, and changes in the marine ecosystem are underway. There, food webs are generally supported by algae. Algae feed large swarms of Antarctic krill, which are the main food for large predators, including the region’s Adélie penguins. Algal blooms, krill, and Adélie penguins are all dependent on how much seasonal sea ice there is and when it begins to melt in the spring. Populations of Adélie Penguins (bright blue line) have crashed as sea ice in their habitat disappears. Population of the warm-adapted Gentoo penguin (dark blue line) are climbing. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from Figure SB6.2 in  Since the early 1990s, mainly due to the decreasing seasonal sea ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, the population of the native Adélie penguin has catastrophically declined. On the other hand, Gentoo penguins– an invasive species from warmer regions – can more readily handle changes in seasonal sea ice. The first Gentoo breeding pairs were observed in this region in 1994, and their population has increased dramatically as the seasonal sea ice cover has declined and water temperatures have increased. Meanwhile, in the Northern Hemisphere, Arctic air temperatures are warming twice as fast as lower latitudes. As if to remind us of this fact, 2015 tied as the warmest year on record for the region, and sea ice reached its fourth lowest extent. When air temperatures rise and sea ice melts, the impacts may be widespread and sometimes permanent. Walruses provide a stark example. These animals mate along ice edges in the drifting pack ice during winter and give birth on sea ice in spring. They use sea ice to rest, or “haul out” of the water, if it is close to where they hunt for food.   Thousands of walruses hauled out on a barrier island offshore of Alaska’s northern coast in late summer 2014.  Photo by Corey Accardo, NOAA/NMFS. Decreasing summer ice in the Bering and Chukchi Seas is leading females and their calves to rest on the shoreline, which has resulted in many calf fatalities due to overcrowding and trampling. Walruses may also have to travel longer distances, as much as 110 miles one way, to hunt for food. And it’s not just sea ice decline impacting the walruses. Other factors connected to climate change, such as increased shipping and development, increased disease, and ocean acidification impacts, will also likely play a role in the future of these mammals. The Arctic oceans are experiencing incredible warmth as well. Average surface temperatures in ice-free regions in August 2015 were up to 14 degrees F above average in several regions. As oceans warm, several fish species in the Northern Hemisphere are moving from their native areas northward into cooler waters. In the span of a decade, warm water fish species from the North Atlantic have pushed Arctic species out of the Barents Sea. NOAA Climate.gov images based on originals by Maria Fossheim. Warmer-water fish, such as North Atlantic cod, beaked redfish, and long rough dab, have moved into northern parts of the Barents Sea, pushing out local Arctic fish. These newcomers can handle a wide range of habitats and feed on diverse prey, making them more likely to thrive in a changing environment than the native species. North Atlantic cod—the most important commercial species—has not been this abundant since the 1950s. The larger fish from the south will compete with the smaller Arctic species for food, and even prey on them directly. As new competitors and predators arrive, even the most abundant Arctic species in the northern Barents Sea, the local Polar cod, could become extinct. The Arctic marine food web may change as well, causing ecological impacts to spread more quickly.

These harmful algal blooms can occur annually in the region, but significant impacts are typically are more localized compared to the simultaneous and widespread effects that lasted into 2016.  produces a neurotoxin called domoic acid, which can build up in shellfish, other invertebrates, and fish. This can lead to illness and death in a variety of birds and mammals that consume them. This May 22, 2015, photo shows a fin whale calf floating off Marmot Bay in Kodiak Island, Alaska. This calf is one of an unusually large number of whale deaths in the Western Gulf of Alaska since May. Photo by Rob Baer, Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The 2015 bloom was the largest in at least the past 15 years. Concentrations of domoic acid measured in the algae, released into seawater, and in the bodies of many forage fish and shellfish were among the highest ever reported for this region. By mid-May, domoic acid concentrations in Monterey Bay, California, were 10 to 30 times the amount considered “high” for a normal bloom. Climate and biology experts think that unusually warm surface waters in the region, which have been in place since 2013, contributed to the severity and early onset of the bloom.  Help us improve our content"},

Let us explain.", "content": "On the third Thursday of every month, NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center issues an   for the United States for the coming month. These climate outlooks are updated on the last day of each month. Those updated outlooks are the basis for the posts that appear on Climate.gov each month.   are released around the middle of each month.  NOAA’s monthly and seasonal climate outlooks do not predict the actual temperature or precipitation amounts for upcoming months or seasons. Instead, they predict the probability (percent chance) that upcoming monthly or seasonal average temperature or precipitation will fall in the top third, middle third, or bottom third of the climate record at a given place. Currently, the climate record spans 1991-2020. For simplicity, we refer to those categories as    , or  mal. The colors on the outlook maps show which of the three is most likely. NOAA’s temperature outlook for the 3-month “season” of February–April 2024 showing which temperature outcome was forecast as most likely in different parts of the country—orange and red for well above normal, blues for well below normal, and gray for near normal. The darker the color, the higher the chances of that outcome, not the bigger the departure from normal. White areas mean that any of the three outcomes was equally likely. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data form the Climate Prediction Center. The darker the color, the higher the chances of that category,   the bigger the departure from normal. In the map above, the darker orange in the Pacific Northwest or Alaska does not mean temperatures there were predicted to be farther above average than temperatures in the Great Lakes region. The size of the predicted temperature anomaly (  means \"difference from average\") in each place was the same: in the upper third of the local temperatures recorded for all February–April periods in the 1991–2020 climate record. Instead, the darker colors mean the odds of that happening in Washington, Oregon, or interior Alaska were higher (50-60% chance) than in the Great Lakes Region (40-50% chance). White areas on the maps mean \"equal chances\". In those areas, forecasters think that any of the three possible temperature or precipitation outcomes—well above, well below, or near normal—are equally likely. Sometimes an \"equal chances\" forecast means that there are no strong influences in the climate system that would favor one outcome over another, so forecasters default to the average climatological frequency (33.3 percent chance each). Other times it means that there are competing influences, and forecasters can't say which is more likely to win out.  In the real world, the probability for a single category will never be 100 percent. We will never be able to say a month in advance that there is a 100 percent chance of a wetter-than-average May, for instance. The climate is not that predictable. There's always a chance one of the other outcomes sneaks in there. A complete climate outlook, then, is three forecasts rolled into one: the probability of well above normal temperature or precipitation, the probability of well below normal temperature or precipitation, and the probability of near-normal temperature or precipitation. (left of slider) An outlook map uses color coding to show the outcome forecasters think is most likely for the upcoming month or season. (right of slider) Even when one outcome is favored, however, the full forecast shows the other outcomes remain possible. The possibility of negative outcomes means those using forecasts that use probability have to carefully balance risk and reward. NOAA Climate.gov images, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center.  Outlook maps show which climate outcome is favored and by how much. To determine the odds of the less likely climate outcomes, forecasters subtract the highest probability from 100 percent and divide the remainder between the other two categories. If the highest probability category is \"near normal,\" then the remaining probability is split evenly between the \"well above normal\" and \"well below normal\" categories. If forecasters think there is a 40 percent chance of near-normal temperature in the Pacific Northwest for the coming month, that leaves 60 percent chance (100 minus 40) to be split evenly between the less likely outcomes: 30 percent chance of much cooler than normal and 30 percent chance of much warmer than normal. Diagram of the probabilities of the less-likely temperature outcomes when the most likely outcome is near-normal temperatures. The chances of near-normal temperatures are subtracted from 100 and the remainder is split evenly between the above- and below-normal outcomes. NOAA Climate.gov, adapted from Climate Prediction Center  . If the highest probability outcome is well above or below normal, the math for splitting up the remaining odds is a little more complicated. Physically speaking, it makes sense that if the odds have tilted   one climate extreme by a given percent, they’ve tilted   from the opposite extreme outcome by an equal amount. So by convention, forecasters divvy up the remaining probability by holding the chances for near-normal conditions at the climatological average of 33.3 percent, and then subtracting that from the total remainder. What’s left is the probability of the least-favored category. For example, if the outlook says there is a 40 percent chance of much warmer than normal October in the Southwest, the remaining 60 percent chance would be split unevenly. Near normal would be given the default climatological probability of 33.3 percent, leaving a 26.7 percent chance (60 minus 33.3) of a much cooler than average October. The diagram below shows how each map category breaks down into a full climate forecast. A full monthly temperature outlook is made up of three probabilities: the chances for a warmer-than-average month (yellow to red colors), the chances of a near-average month (gray), and the chances of a cooler-than-average month (blue colors). As the chances of one outcome increase, the chances of the opposite outcome decrease—but never all the way to zero. NOAA Climate.gov graphic, adapted from Climate Prediction Center histogram. If you proceed on this way for higher probabilities of above- or below-normal outcomes, you would eventually reach a point where once you've subtracted from 100 and then given 33.3 percent to the near-normal category, there would be zero or negative percent chance left over for the opposite outcome. Because there is always some degree of uncertainty in any climate forecast, forecasters know it would not be realistic to say there is zero percent chance of a given outcome, any more than they would say there was a 100 percent chance. So even when the climate seems tipped very strongly toward a given outcome, forecasters never set the probability of the less likely outcomes below 3.3 percent. When one outcome is strongly favored, forecasters set a minimum 3.3 percent chance for the opposite outcome and place the remainder of the balance on a near-normal outcome. For example, if an outlook said the chance of a much warmer than average winter was 80 percent, then the chance of a much colder than average winter would be 3.3 percent, and the chance for a near-normal winter would be 16.7 percent (100 minus 80 minus 3.3). In ski season roulette, a climate outlook will never completely crush a skier's hopes. Even for a hypothetical forecast for an 80% chance of a warmer-than-average winter, forecasters leave at least a small chance—by convention NOAA forecasters say 3.3%—that a cold winter will happen. And of course, a single big snow event can sometimes save an otherwise poor season.

Long-term protection of Earth’s climate and oceans requires substantial reductions in  .    (2nd Edition, 2024) estimates that 7–9 gigatonnes (Gt) CO  removal will be required each year by 2050 to achieve the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. ~2 GtCO  removal per year is already occurring, primarily through conventional CDR methods. Conventional methods are those that are already well established and part of land-use change or forestry activities (e.g., reforestation/afforestation, wetland restoration, soil carbon). Emerging, or “novel”, CDR methods currently contribute only 0.0013 GtCO  removal per year, but are growing at a more rapid rate. To reach the 2050 goal, a large-scale increase in the capacity of novel CDR pathways is required. If this is achieved, the total CDR carbon sinks would be comparable to the size of the natural land and ocean carbon sinks ( ). The global carbon budget for 2022 showing the approximate size of CO2 emissions sources and natural sinks compared to the projected size of the CDR sink for 2050 and 2100 needed to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement (values from Friedlingstein et al., 2022 and Minx et al., 2018). There has been a substantial increase in investment in research and development of CDR methods from national governments, private industry, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These early investments are essential if CDR is to be implemented at large scale.  Novel CDR pathways are currently in their infancy and all approaches require additional research and development. If scaled, a successful CDR strategy would need to be appropriately balanced with other   to ensure responsible, permanent carbon removal. CDR methods can be divided into two main categories: land-based approaches and ocean-based approaches (also called marine CDR or mCDR), as illustrated in   Schematic illustrating land-based and marine CDR approaches. Land-based approaches involve changes to agriculture, forests, and other land-use activities, as well as   of CO . DAC describes a number of processes that remove CO  from the air with a liquid or solid adsorbent and then store the carbon in under- ground reservoirs. Other land-based CDR approaches include   of natural carbonate and silicate rocks, methods for increasing soil carbon uptake (e.g., agricultural sequestration), and storage in above- ground biomass (e.g.,  ). Biomass/crop residues can be converted into a more stable form of carbon, known as  , which can be stored long-term in soils or underground. Marine CDR approaches can amplify the ocean’s natural carbon cycles that pull carbon from the atmosphere and transport it into the deep ocean.  , which increases the ocean’s drawdown of CO  by lowering surface water acidity, has the potential added benefit of mitigating  . Other methods include     (nutrient addition), and   to encourage phytoplankton growth and export. Alternatively, engineered approaches can strip CO  from seawater in a process known as  . Activities that enhance   typically focus on restoration and/or conservation of naturally occurring ecosystems, but may also provide local to regional carbon removal. When these methods are carefully carried out alongside appropriate monitoring, report- ing, and verification (MRV), they can be considered CDR. A coastal blue carbon project may be considered a land- or ocean-based approach depending on the methodology (e.g. mangroves vs seagrass projects). To be considered CDR, CO  must be directly removed from the atmosphere, converted to long-duration (100–1000 years) storage products, and result in negative emissions for the overall process. Therefore, CDR approaches and their environmental impacts would need a robust system for MRV to meet these standards. The development of an MRV system is critical for accurately tracking and providing accountability metrics for carbon removal. CDR methods are evaluated on several metrics: scalability, durability and duration of storage, energy requirements, economic feasibility, and environmental impacts. A fundamental challenge of CDR is achieving the enormous scale of required carbon removal on a suitably rapid timescale with minimal impact on the environment and marine habitats (such as from mining, acid production, waste products, etc.). Scalability refers both to how quickly CDR projects can be replicated, given space, time, and cost constraints, and to the theoretical cap on the total potential carbon removal. CO  has a lifetime in the atmosphere and oceans of 1000s of years. It is imperative that carbon reservoirs are sustainable over long periods with minimal leakage back into the atmosphere. Temporary reservoirs, such as plants and trees, return CO  to the atmosphere when they die or are destroyed (e.g., by wildfire). Conversely, geologic carbon storage in the form of dissolved CO  or solid carbonates (rock) in deep sea sediments is an effectively permanent (>1000 years) removal. For CDR methods to be carbon negative, the energy required to drive the system, to mine or engineer the materials needed to convert CO  to a more durable form, and to transport and store the carbon, must come from renewable or non-CO  emitting sources. A key challenge for DAC and DOR systems is the necessary high-energy inputs. The cost of CDR methods is determined by the cost-per-ton of carbon removed. Some techniques, such as DAC, currently have a high cost due to the infrastructure and materials required. The development of a carbon management industry could have widespread economic benefits, with estimates of 300,000 new jobs by 2050 and an overall industry valuation of US $259B by 2050. Large-scale CDR actions may have a variety of co-benefits and unintended negative side effects. Co-benefits of CDR include potential mitigation of ocean acidification and improvements to coastal wetlands, forests, and soils that would promote biodiversity, environmental sustainability, and crop/food production. A primary concern of CDR is managing the extremely large waste flows (stored carbon) that would need to be safely deposited and stored for hundreds to thousands of years. The side effects of mCDR techniques on ocean ecosystems are also not fully understood and could include depletion of subsurface oxygen, changes in ocean biogeochemistry and habitat, shifts in marine food webs, and other unintended consequences for ocean life.  Given the novelty of this field, the regulatory landscape for permitting and environmental protection is still being developed.  Given NOAA’s ocean regulatory authority, NOAA is   with other Federal agencies and stakeholders on  . Codes of conduct are beginning to emerge for CDR and mCDR research and/or implementation, but are not binding. International agreements, such as the London Convention and London Protocol covering marine pollution, are actively considering whether to incorporate more mCDR strategies into their framework. , suggesting that well-resourced, community-driven decision making, equitable distribution of deployment and employment, geopolitical responsibility sharing, development of a diverse scientific workforce, and transparent technology transfer will be essential to inform deployment strategies and safeguard against past, present, and future harms for marginalized communities.  Accordingly, researching how CDR techniques may change the climate system are already part of NOAA’s purview. Assessing the effectiveness and safety of CDR approaches is directly related to NOAA’s mission to study linkages between the ocean and atmosphere.  NOAA’s existing and innovative assets can inform evidence-based decisions on implementation of CDR techniques by federal and state agencies, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations. NOAA’s mission also includes the stewardship of environmental resources (e.g., fisheries and aquaculture, coastal wetlands, protected/endangered species, and marine sanctuaries) that may be affected, both positively and negatively, by CDR.  in areas such as seafood production, protected species conservation and recovery, marine ecosystem structure and function, and coastal communities will play a role in mCDR research and implementation permitting.  In 2023, NOAA led the  on mCDR. Full details on NOAA’s CDR research engagement are available in the   report, published in 2023.

As such, drought across the country increased again last month. Temperatures during September were mixed with much above-normal temperatures across the Northern Plains, but normal to even below-normal temperatures across parts of the Southeast and Eastern U.S. With over 70% of the nation at least abnormally dry, will October be another drier-than-normal month, adding to further expansion of drought? And as we head closer to winter, will the mild temperatures of September continue? Let’s see what NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) predicts for October. The U.S. temperature outlook for October 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for October or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean  , not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average October.  or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average October temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only   available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.  On September 30, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for October 2024. The temperature outlook favors well above   across the central and western parts of the nation, as well as around the Great Lakes and Northeast. The precipitation outlook favors well below   across much of the central and western parts of the country, with above-average precipitation only favored along the South Atlantic Coast and in Florida. The precipitation outlook for October 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean  , not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average October.  or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total October precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only   available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.  I’ll also provide more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, as well as discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during September, and the drought outlook for October. Finally, remember that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the   outcome, and that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found  . The updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC’s own 6-10 day, Week 2, and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), and the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. Since we’re still   it did not play a role in the October outlooks. And while the   has been active recently the current response in the mid-latitudes has not been consistent with the overwhelming majority of the medium and extended range guidance, so it did not play a significant role in the outlooks. The October temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across all of the central and western parts of the nation, in northern Alaska, in southern Florida, around the Great Lakes, and in the Northeast. (  means “in the warmest third of all Octobers in the recent climate record.”) E  odds (chance of below-, near-, and above-average) were found in the remainder of the country. The best odds for a warmer-than-average October are centered over the Four Corners region, where probabilities exceed 70%. Almost all of the western and west-central parts of the nation have probabilities exceeding 50%, as temperatures are favored to be above-average in all CPC outlooks for much of this region (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4). And October is already forecast to begin warm with temperatures expected to be more than 10°F above average, according to forecasts by the WPC. Forecast ridging (jet stream shifted north of normal) is consistently forecast during all time scales for the western part of the nation, consistent with the outlooks. Throughout the Southeast and Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, weak troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) in response to the western ridging introduces a high degree of uncertainty. The CPC mid-range guidance favors near-average temperatures and the longer-range guidance (Week 3-4) has an equal chance forecast. The precipitation outlook for October favors below-average rainfall across large parts of the country, with the largest odds (greater than 50%) found in the southern and central Plains. The aforementioned predicted ridging over the West supports the large area favored to have another drier-than-average month. Below-normal rainfall is also favored in the short-, medium-, and longer-range outlooks. Above-average rainfall is only favored for southern Alaska and the extreme Southeast including Florida, where the month is expected to begin quite wet. All of CPC’s outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4) also have some tilt in the odds toward wetter-than-average conditions here. Drought conditions across the contiguous United States as of September 24, 2024. Pockets of extreme (red) and exceptional (dark red) drought were present in Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Ohio, and West Virginia. A fairly large area of the lower 48 was at least abnormally dry (yellow). This map was produced prior to the arrival of extreme rainfall associated with Hurricane Helene across the Southeast at the end of September. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by the  .  With another mostly dry month in the books, the amount of drought across the continuous United States continued to increase during September. Drought increased from almost 28% at the beginning of the month to over 34% at the end with another 38% of the nation classified as abnormally dry, potentially setting the state for further drought development. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing   and   drought) also increased during the month to just over 3%, although that continues to remain fairly low by historical standards. Regionally, most of the significant increase in drought was concentrated in the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, with much of this region recording 2-3 class changes. The drought monitor shown here was finalized prior to the rainfall from Hurricane Helene, so improvements in these regions will appear in the next Drought Monitor. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, the southern, central and northern Plains (up to 2 class changes), and in the Northeast. In contrast, some drought improvement was observed in parts of the Northwest and across parts of the South, with the largest improvement occurring in central Texas (2-3 classes, with some removal). U.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in October 2024. Several new areas of drought are likely to develop (yellow) across the central states. Existing drought in those areas and in portions of the West, and Ohio Valley are likely to continue or worsen (brown). Existing drought in the Central and Southern Appalachians is expected to improve by at least 1 category (tan) or end (green). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See   for Alaska and Hawaii. Drought persistence during October is likely for large parts of the central and western U.S., with above-average temperatures and below-average rainfall favored for most of these regions. Drought development is also predicted across parts of the Plains, mainly in regions with significant 90-day precipitation deficits and declining soil moisture. Although the precipitation outlook also depicts increased odds for below-normal rainfall out West, no large-scale development is anticipated since drought development tends to be slower in this region, during what is typically a dry month. In contrast, heavy to excessive rainfall associated with Hurricane Helene and its remnants will lead to drought improvement or removal across parts of the Southeast and in the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys. However, drought is predicted to persist in the northern part of the Ohio Valley, as rainfall amounts from Helene’s remnants were less than 2 inches and October is slightly favored to be drier-than-average.

Only fossil fuels—which are the remains of millions of years of carbon uptake by plants—contain enough carbon to produce such a massive change in such a short time.

The peaks and valleys in the line show ice ages (low CO ) and warmer interglacials (higher CO ). Throughout that time, CO  was never higher than 300 ppm (light purple dot, between 300,000 and 400,000 years ago). The increase over the last 60 years is 100 times faster than previous natural increases. In fact, on the geologic time scale, the increase from the end of the last ice age to the present (dashed purple line) looks virtually instantaneous. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov based on data from Lüthi, et al., 2008, via NOAA NCEI Paleoclimatology Program. In addition, only fossil fuels are consistent with the   of the carbon in today’s atmosphere. Different kinds of carbon-containing material have different relative amounts of “light” carbon-12, “heavy” carbon-13, and radioactive carbon-14. Plant matter is enriched in carbon-12, because its lighter weight is more readily used by plants during photosynthesis. Volcanic emissions are enriched in carbon-13. The ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere and the ocean are roughly the same. Since carbon-14 is radioactive, it decays predictably over time. Young organic matter has more carbon-14 than older organic matter, and fossil fuels have no measurable carbon-14 at all. As carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have risen over the past century or more, the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 has fallen, which means that the source of the extra carbon dioxide must be enriched in \"light\" carbon-12. Meanwhile, the relative amount of carbon-14—radioactive carbon—has declined. The record of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is complicated by nuclear bomb testing after 1950, which doubled the amount of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere. After the nuclear test ban treaty in 1963, the excess atmospheric carbon-14 began to decline as it dispersed into the oceans and the land biosphere. In the last four decades, however, the decline of carbon-14 has been noticeably faster than can be explained by continuing dispersal of the bomb-related carbon-14. This faster decline is driven by the addition to the atmosphere of huge amounts of carbon dioxide from a source with no carbon-14. As this carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, it dilutes the ratio of 14-carbon dioxide (i.e., carbon dioxide containing a carbon-14 atom) to total carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Taken together, then, we are looking for a source of carbon dioxide that comes from terrestrial plants (because they are depleted in \"heavy\" carbon-13), is so old that any carbon-14 it once contained has decayed to non-detectable levels, and is capable of creating a pulse of carbon dioxide that is larger and faster than anything that’s occurred in at least the past million years. Only fossil fuels meet all those criteria. Help us improve our content"},

Mountain glaciers are melting worldwide, and snow cover is declining in the Northern Hemisphere (Learn more   and  ). Greenland’s ice sheet—which holds about 8 percent of Earth’s fresh water—is melting at an accelerating rate ( ). Mean global sea level is rising ( ). Arctic sea ice is declining rapidly in both thickness and extent ( ). The Greenland Ice Sheet lost mass again in 2020, but not as much as it did 2019. Adapted from the 2020 Arctic Report Card, this graph tracks Greenland mass loss measured by NASA's GRACE satellite missions since 2002. The background photo shows a glacier calving front in western Greenland, captured from an airplane during a NASA Operation IceBridge field campaign.    We know this warming is largely caused by human activities because the key role that carbon dioxide plays in maintaining Earth’s natural greenhouse effect has been understood since the mid-1800s. Unless it is offset by some equally large cooling influence, more atmospheric carbon dioxide will lead to warmer surface temperatures. Since 1800, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere   from about 280 parts per million to 410 ppm in 2019.

Philip James de Loutherbourg's 1801 painting,  , came to symbolize the start of the Industrial Revolution, when humans began to harness the power of fossil fuels—and to contribute significantly to Earth's atmospheric greenhouse gas composition.

Still, when we step back and look at the big picture, it’s clear the two are tightly connected. ( ) Yearly temperature compared to the twentieth-century average from 1850–2023.

NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). As the graph above shows, both global temperature (colored bars) and atmospheric carbon dioxide (gray line) increased more slowly during the first half of the observational record in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rose by around 20 parts per million over the 7 decades from 1880­–1950, while the temperature increased by an average of 0.04° C per decade. Over the next 7 decades, however, carbon dioxide climbed nearly 100 ppm—5 times as fast! To put those changes in some historical context, the amount of rise in carbon dioxide levels since the late 1950s would naturally, in the context of  , have taken somewhere in the range of 5,000 to 20,000 years; we’ve managed to do it in about 60. At the same time, the rate of warming averaged 0.14° C per decade. The rapid rate of temperature rise over such a short period time points to only one thing, and that is the addition of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, into the environment.  Within any given decade, however, the temperature bounces around between warm and cool years. The warmest years are usually El Niño years, when the eastern and central tropical Pacific is warmer than average. The coldest years are generally La Niña years, when that same part of the tropical Pacific is cooler than average. On a longer time scale, warm decades are often associated with strongly positive phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and cool decades with strongly negative phases. In general, the warmest year of any decade will be an El Niño year, the coldest a La Niña one. This graph shows annual average surface temperatures (gray bars), grouped by decade, from 1950 to 2021. The warmest and coldest years of each decade are topped with circles:   for El Niño-influenced years and   for La Niña years. We considered a year El Niño or La Niña \"influenced\" if the December-February was labelled as part of a   by NOAA's Climate Prediction Center or if more than half of the months in that year were. By our definition, 1979 did not qualify as El Niño year because El Niño conditions were present for only 3 months late in the year. 1992 was the coldest year of the 1990s despite being an El Niño year because of the cooling influence of the  eruption of   in 1991.

And while these natural climate patterns—through which the ocean alternately accumulates and releases heat—are the most important cause of short-term variations in global surface temperature, other factors occasionally contribute:  ,  , and smoke and other pollution particles. The global ocean buffers Earth’s temperature from rapid change; that   to the evolution of complex life on our planet over millions of years. Even with respect to global warming, the ocean’s inertia works in our favor in one way: it provides us with a modest window of time to adapt to and begin to combat climate change before we are forced to confront its full effects on  ,  , and  . Like a room's worth of mess stuffed into an overflowing closet,  excess heat from carbon dioxide is being hidden in the ocean—thanks to its tremendous heat capacity and volume.  NOAA Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh.  But there’s a downside to the delayed reaction, too. Like a speeding train, the warming won’t stop the instant we hit the brakes. At whatever point we manage to halt or reverse the trend in greenhouse gases, some additional warming will occur due to the heating imbalance that is already in the pipeline. A   from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates how much we could currently expect based on emissions to date:   If all anthropogenic [human-caused] emissions...were reduced to zero immediately, any further warming beyond the 1°C already experienced would likely be less than 0.5°C over the next two to three decades ( ), and likely less than 0.5°C on a century time scale ( )…. A warming greater than 1.5°C is therefore not geophysically unavoidable: whether it will occur depends on future rates of emission reductions. Allen, M.R., O.P. Dube, W. Solecki, F. Aragón-Durand, W.

In this case, the high-emissions future represents a specific Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) called RCP 8.5.  Temperature projections in these images represent output from 32 global climate models that are all part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ( ). Projections labeled as “High emissions” represent a potential future in which global emissions continue increasing through the 21  century. By 2100, the result of this pathway is climate forcing of 8.5 Watts per square meter at the top of the atmosphere. Based on the energy imbalance along this pathway, global climate models calculate temperature across Earth’s surface for future periods. The RCP 8.5 scenario represents a future in which no climate policies are enacted. To produce regionally relevant projections, results from the global models were statistically downscaled using a method called Localized Constructed Analogs ( ). This technique uses observed local-scale weather and climate information to increase the spatial resolution of global-scale projections, and corrects for bias in the model simulations. Images of long-term averages from 1981 to 2010 ( ) show recent conditions; these maps provide a baseline for comparison with future projections. To produce the normals data, the PRISM group at Oregon State University gathered temperature and precipitation records from a range of federal, state, and international weather station networks, and then mapped them to a grid. To fill map areas between observation stations, the group used a digital elevation model as a predictor grid, and refined the model to account for local effects of mountains, distance from coasts, and other factors that affect climate in complex terrains. Shades of blue show where average maximum temperature for the month was, or is projected to be, below 60°F during the period indicated. The darker the shade of blue, the lower the temperature. Areas shown in shades of orange and red had, or are projected to have, average maximum temperatures over 60°F. The darker the shade of orange or red, the higher the temperature. White or very light colors show where the average maximum temperature was, or is projected to be, near 60°F. In order to meet future needs for energy, food, and public health, planners and other decision makers need to understand how temperatures are projected to change over the coming decades. As the climate system continues responding to the heat-trapping gases we have added to the atmosphere, temperatures will change at different rates in different regions. These images can help people get a sense of how much warming their region will experience each decade so they can plan ahead for new conditions. These data also provide people with a way to compare conditions projected for stabilized emissions with conditions projected for high emissions. Comparing the two potential futures may encourage people to take actions to reduce emissions.  We used a suite of Python scripts to process and visualize LOCA (Localized Constructed Analogs) data. The processing scripts averaged the daily values for each month in a given decade from all 32 global climate models that comprise the LOCA dataset. We then calculated the median of all models in each month of the decade. The visualization scripts produced maps of the results within the contiguous United States. For further information, see the  . We offer these prepared maps as .png image files. Observed temperatures for the last three decades (1981-2010) fall mostly within the range from 0-100°F; this is the temperature range we used to produce sets of 30-yr average temperature maps for Data Snapshots. The range was selected to reveal patterns of recent temperature across the maps. In order to generate a consistent set of maps that represent recent AND future temperatures, we needed to show temperatures from 10-110°F. Therefore, if you compare Data Snapshots’ PRISM normals images with our 30-year average images side-by-side, you will see slightly different colors representing the same data values. Always interpret color-coded images by checking the numerical values shown on their color bars. Pierce, D. W., D. R. Cayan, and B. L. Thrasher, 2014:  .

The total extent is the area of all pixels in the satellite image where the ice concentration is at least 15 percent. The amount of sea ice ice that survives the summer melt is declining rapidly. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on   from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The   occupies about 6 million square miles around Earth's North Pole. Historically, most of the surface of the Arctic Ocean remained ice-covered year round. Around this core of year-round ice was a fringe of seasonal ice that froze each winter and melted each summer. The Arctic ice pack reaches its maximum extent in March, and its minimum extent in September. In September 2022, the area that was at least 15 percent ice covered was 4.87 million square kilometers (1.88 million square miles), tying with 2010 for eleventh lowest in the satellite record. That's 1.54 million square kilometers (595,000 square miles) smaller than the 1981-2010 average—an area larger than Alaska. The smallest daily extent occurred on September 18, when the total ice extent bottomed out for the summer at 4.67 million square kilometers (1.8 million square miles). Arctic sea ice extent for September 19 2023, was 4.23 million square kilometers (1.63 million square miles). It was the sixth smallest summer minimum on record. The orange line shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for that day. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the amount of ice that survives the summer melt season has shrunk by 13 percent per decade relative to the 1981–2010 average. In the  , experts reported that the average minimum extent for each third of the satellite record has successively declined: 6.85 million square kilometers (2.64 million square miles) for 1979-1992, 6.13 million square kilometers (2.37 million square miles) for 1993-2006, and 4.44 million square kilometers (1.71 million square miles) for 2007-2020. Just as ponds and lakes in northern states develop a layer of ice on their surfaces during cold winters, the surface of the Arctic Ocean also freezes, forming sea ice. Seawater has a lower freezing point than fresh water, but once it is chilled to around -2°C (about 28°F), the salty liquid begins to solidify. Ice crystals appear on the sea surface, and if the air is cold enough, the crystals expand to form a slushy mix, then a solid covering of ice that can thicken over time. In the Arctic Ocean, the area covered by sea ice grows and shrinks over the course of the year. Each fall, as less sunlight reaches the Arctic and air temperatures begin to drop, additional sea ice forms. The total area covered by ice increases through the winter, usually reaching its maximum extent in early March. Once spring arrives, bringing more sunlight and higher temperatures, the ice begins to melt back, shrinking to its minimum extent each September. Sea ice minimum and maximum extents occur toward the end of summer and the end of winter in part because the ocean lags behind the atmosphere in warming up and cooling down. Sea ice that hasn't yet survived a summer melt season is first-year ice. This thin, new ice is vulnerable to melt and disintegration in stormy conditions. Ice that survives a summer melt season can grow thicker and less salty—two things that make it more resistant to melt. Multiyear ice is more likely to survive temperatures that would melt first-year ice, and to survive waves and winds that would break up first-year ice. Although sea ice moves more slowly than ocean water, ice still moves. Carried by ocean currents, Arctic sea ice regularly flows out toward the warmer waters in the Atlantic via the Fram Strait east of Greenland. Scientists use climate proxies like sediment/ice cores, tree rings, and fossilized shells of ocean creatures to infer sea ice extent far back in time. These paleoclimate records show that while there have been several periods over the past 1,450 years when sea ice extents expanded and contracted, the decrease during the modern era is unrivaled. In the 2017 issue of NOAA’s Arctic Report Card, scientists reported that today's low extent is far lower than anything that's occurred over at least the past 1,500 years. Not only that, but it is well outside the range of natural variability during that period. This time series shows the Arctic sea ice extent in millions of square kilometers over the past roughly 1,500 years. The vertical axis starts at 8, not 0, to better show year-to-year variations. Taken from the 2017 issue of NOAA’s Arctic Report Card, scientists report on a body of paleoclimate research that shows that the extent and rate of sea ice decline in the Arctic is unprecedented over at least the past 1,500 years. Climate.gov image adapted from Figure 3 in “Paleoceanographic Perspectives on Arctic Ocean Change” in the 2017 Arctic Report Card. Original data from Kinnard et al., 2011. Early observations of sea ice coverage in the Arctic come to us both from the oral histories of native populations and from the records of early European mariners who were seeking a \"Northwest Passage\" to the lucrative markets in Asia. Records of sea ice near the coast of Iceland data back to the 9th century, and records became more routine in the 17th century. British and Russian records of sea ice conditions along sailing routes became routine in the 18th and 19th centuries. Detailed shipping charts, available from the United Kingdom Met Office Hadley Centre, show that Arctic sea ice has declined at least since the mid-1950s. Satellite data have documented continued declines; since continuous satellite-based measurements began in November 1978, data show a trend of more ice melting away during summers and less new ice forming during winters. The Beaufort Gyre, a looping current north of Alaska, historically acted as a nursery for young ice, enabling it to thicken and grow. Ice growth in the Beaufort Gyre roughly offset the flow of ice out of the Arctic via the Fram Strait. Since the start of the 20th century, however, summers in the southern portion of the gyre have been too warm for sea ice to survive. Routine observations of Arctic sea ice   only began about a decade ago, experts use the age of the ice pack—which has been observed since the 1980s—as a proxy for ice thickness. In mid-March 1985 (left), the winter maximum ice pack was dominated by ice at least 4 years old (white). In 2021 (right), only a small strip of very old ice remained tucked up against the islands of the Canadian Arctic. More than half of the winter ice pack was less than a year old (dark blue). NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. These changes in ice survival mean that even though the sea ice extent at the winter maximum in March has declined more slowly than the extent at summer minimum (2.6 percent per decade in March versus 13 percent per decade in September), the winter ice pack is fundamentally different than it once was. Near the start of the satellite era in the mid-1980s, as much as one-third of the ice cover was made up of thick, multi-year ice. In 2020, it was 5 percent. Percent difference from average sea ice extent in the Arctic at each year's summer minimum in September (bright blue) and winter maximum in March (dark blue) from 1979–2022. Sea ice is declining 5 times more quickly in summer than it is in winter. NOAA Climate.gov image, adapted from Figure 1 in  Having so much of the winter ice cover made up of thin, first year ice creates a feedback loop in which the ice is less likely to survive in the summer. It makes the ice pack particularly vulnerable to big, single-year drops during exceptionally warm or stormy summers, drops that the ice pack is unlikely to recover from in the current climate. In addition, the thin ice is more dangerous for native Arctic people who still practice their traditional way of life, which depends on reliably thick ice for hunting and fishing activities. In coastal communities, thin ice also provides far less protection than thick ice from the pounding surf that accompanies fall and winter storms.    Arctic sea ice declines are related to the phenomenon known as  : more intense warming in the Arctic than over the rest of the globe.   fits with current scientific understanding of Earth's climate system, and with model projections of global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Multiple factors contribute to Arctic amplification, and sea ice loss is one of them. Sea ice's white or light gray surface reflects up to 80 percent of incoming sunlight, deflecting additional energy away from the planet. With less ice present, the dark surface of ocean water absorbs considerably more sunlight energy, leading to further warming of the sea surface and overlying atmosphere, which leads to more melting of ice, which leads to more warming, and so on. Scientists are actively studying the effects of this feedback loop to help them understand and predict how decreases in Arctic sea ice and snow cover will affect the global climate system. In the early 20th century, explorer Roald Amundsen took three years (1903–1906) to traverse the Northwest Passage, a route that would allow ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the western Arctic. Although it's not yet a dependable pathway for commercial ships, the Northwest Passage has experienced  multiple times since the turn of the 21st century, drawing tourists. Meanwhile, the Northern Sea Route along the coast of Siberia has experienced more consistent ice-free conditions in the summer, which may soon transform it into a reliable shipping route. The opening of shipping lanes across the Arctic may provide shippers with viable alternatives to traveling through the Panama Canal or around the southern tip of South America. This new reality will have impacts not only on the environment, but also on the world economy and national security, as nations compete to gain rights to shipping lanes and newly accessible resources in the Arctic. Responding to oil spills in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean would pose unique challenges. For example, floating booms often used to concentrate oil for burning—as in this field experiment in the Barents Sea—must be strong enough to handle increased drag from ice floes. Photo courtesy  Loss of sea ice means lost habitat for marine mammals like polar bears, walruses, and seals, along with disruptions to the food supply of Arctic communities who depend on them. A longer ice-free season exposes Arctic communities to extreme erosion from pounding waves during winter storms. Loss of reflective sea ice and the associated ocean warming are also changing the abundance and range of commercially important high latitude fish species. In addition, in the 2021 Arctic Report Card, scientists reported on two new disturbances related to an increasingly long ice-free season: more underwater noise and more trash from fishing vessels. .

The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA  ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA  ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA  ), with periodic guest contributors. Ideas and explanations found in these posts should be attributed to the ENSO blog team, and not to NOAA (the agency) itself. These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. The articles posted on this blog have described ENSO, its regional and global impacts, and the challenge of forecasting it, among several other topics. Here we introduce another important player on the tropical stage: the   or  While the MJO is a lesser-known phenomenon, it can have dramatic impacts in the mid-latitudes. Several times a year the MJO is a strong contributor to various extreme events in the United States, including Arctic air outbreaks during the winter months across the central and eastern portions of the United States. Imagine ENSO as a person riding a   exercise bike in the middle of a stage all day long. His unchanging location is associated with the persistent changes in   and winds that we have   as being linked to ENSO. Now imagine another bike rider entering the stage on the left and pedaling slowly across the stage, passing the stationary bike (ENSO), and exiting the stage at the right. This bike rider we will call the MJO and he/she may cross the stage from left to right several times during the show. So, unlike ENSO, which is stationary, the MJO is an   disturbance of clouds, rainfall, winds, and pressure that traverses the planet in the tropics and returns to its initial starting point in 30 to 60 days, on average. This atmospheric disturbance is distinct from ENSO, which once established, is associated with persistent features that last several seasons or longer over the Pacific Ocean basin. There can be multiple MJO events within a season, and so the MJO is best described as   tropical climate variability (i.e. varies on a week-to-week basis). The MJO was first discovered in the early 1970s by Dr. Roland Madden and Dr. Paul Julian when they were studying tropical wind and pressure patterns. They often noticed regular oscillations in winds (as defined from departures from average) between Singapore and Canton Island in the west central equatorial Pacific (Madden and Julian, 1971; 1972; Zhang, 2005). The MJO consists of two parts, or  : one is the enhanced rainfall (or  ) phase and the other is the suppressed rainfall phase. Strong MJO activity often dissects the planet into halves: one half within the enhanced convective phase and the other half in the suppressed convective phase. These two phases produce opposite changes in clouds and rainfall and this entire   (i.e., having two main opposing centers of action) propagates eastward. The location of the convective phases are often grouped into geographically based stages that climate scientists number 1-8 as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Difference from average rainfall for all MJO events from 1979-2012 for November-March for the eight phases described in the text. The green shading denotes above-average rainfall, and the brown shading shows below-average rainfall. To first order, the green shading areas correspond to the extent of the enhanced convective phase of the MJO and the brown shading areas correspond to the extent of the suppressed convective phase of the MJO. Note eastward shifting of shaded areas with each successive numbered phase as you view the figure from top to bottom.   For the MJO to be considered active, this dipole of enhanced/suppressed convective phases must be present and shifting eastward with time. An animated illustration that depicts the global scale and eastward propagation of these two phases of the MJO is shown here (Fig. 2: animation). Figure 2. An animation illustrating the organization of the MJO into its enhanced and suppressed convective phases during an MJO event during the spring of 2005. The green shading denotes conditions favorable for large-scale enhanced rainfall, and the brown shading shows conditions unfavorable for rainfall. The MJO becomes organized during late March through May as the green shading covers one half of the planet, and brown shades the other half all along as these areas move west to east with time. Notice how the shading returns to the same location on the order of about 45 days.   Let’s dig a little deeper and look at some of the characteristics within these two convective phases (Figure 3). In the enhanced convective phase, winds at the surface converge, and air is pushed up throughout the atmosphere. At the top of the atmosphere, the winds reverse (i.e., diverge). Such rising air motion in the atmosphere tends to increase condensation and rainfall. The surface and upper-atmosphere structure of the MJO for a period when the enhanced convective phase (thunderstorm cloud) is centered across the Indian Ocean and the suppressed convective phase is centered over the west-central Pacific Ocean. Horizontal arrows pointing left represent wind departures from average that are easterly, and arrows pointing right represent wind departures from average that are westerly. The entire system shifts eastward over time, eventually circling the globe and returning to its point of origin. Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. In the suppressed convective phase, winds converge at the top of the atmosphere, forcing air to sink and, later, to diverge at the surface (Rui and Wang, 1990). As air sinks from high altitudes, it warms and dries, which suppresses rainfall. It is this entire dipole structure, illustrated in Figure 3, that moves west to east with time in the Tropics, causing more cloudiness, rainfall, and even storminess in the enhanced convective phase, and more sunshine and dryness in the suppressed convective phase.   The changes in rainfall and winds described above impact both the Tropics and the Extratropics, which makes the MJO important for extended-range weather and climate prediction over the U.S. and many other areas. The MJO can modulate the timing and strength of monsoons (e.g., Jones and Carvalho, 2002; Lavender and Matthews, 2009), influence tropical cyclone numbers and strength in nearly all ocean basins (e.g., Maloney and Hartmann, 2000), and result in jet stream changes that can lead to cold air outbreaks, extreme heat events, and flooding rains over the United States and North America (Higgins et al. 2000, Cassou, 2008, Lin et al. 2009, Zhou et al., 2012, Riddle et al., 2013, Johnson et al., 2014). The MJO can produce impacts similar to those of ENSO, but which appear only in weekly averages before changing, rather than persisting and therefore appearing in seasonal averages as is the case for ENSO. Future posts will focus on the details of how we monitor and assess the strength of the MJO, provide details on impacts and the reasons for those impacts, and describe the current state of MJO predictability.  Realtime MJO information that is updated daily or weekly can be found on the NOAA CPC  .

Increases in understanding usually occur incrementally and over fairly long periods of time. It might seem like we are stupid, or are not trying hard enough, but that is not the case. The questions are HARD. There are remaining questions about ENSO that are also very difficult. They are as hard as those about why we still don't have a way of preventing the common cold.

The blob is happening in the northern hemisphere, and has been there for a few months. The MJO effects usually follow the MJO itself, progressing from west to east around the globe, unlike the blob which has been relatively stationary. Also, the MJO effects are more easily observed in the atmosphere than the ocean, because it takes longer for the ocean to respond (especially in terms of its surface and subsurface temperature, which mainly define the blob). While there is an effect on the ocean temperature, especially in the tropics, it is not a very large effect because the influence of the MJO keeps changing too quickly. So, the blob is likely mainly related to something other than the MJO, such as the ENSO condition or even the PDO condition preceding its formation. Or, it may not be obviously related to any familiar phenomena and may be \"its own thing\" to large measure.

Many observations have shown anomalously strong MJO activities prior to and during the onset of ENSO warm events.  Numerous journal articles explore in greater detail the relationship between ENSO and the MJO.  Submitted by   on Wed, 06/07/2017 - 14:47 In reply to   by  Submitted by   on Fri, 06/09/2017 - 06:21 In reply to   by  Submitted by   on Fri, 01/03/2020 - 10:31 Submitted by   on Tue, 03/10/2020 - 10:37 The ENSO bloggers have a limited amount of time they can devote to moderating comments.

Submitted by   on Fri, 04/30/2021 - 15:56 In reply to   by  what is the reason for the eastward propagation of MJO??? Submitted by   on Tue, 11/09/2021 - 03:11 The dynamics of the MJO are still not completely understood, so there are a lot details that still need to be worked out. But in general, the eastward propagation relates to how the atmospheric circulation responds to the anomalies of atmospheric convection (the regions of enhanced and suppressed rainfall). Under one framework, the eastward propagation can be understood as a response to the atmospheric Rossby waves forming to the west of the enhanced convection and atmospheric Kelvin waves to the east. The Rossby waves lead to eastward winds while the Kelvin waves lead to westward winds that converge east of the enhanced convection. This converging air rises to the east of the original enhanced convection, leading to new convection and an eastward progression of the whole MJO system.

These areas are plotted on maps and the average total extent for each is computed and recorded in a database. Sea ice extent data are provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The Rutgers University Global Snow Laboratory (GSL) provides measurements of snow cover. Users can generate and examine graphs and statistics on ice and snow, or download the data to populate spreadsheets for further analysis. The graphs illustrate how snow and ice extent have changed for specific months over the past four decades. The graphs also enable users to compare sea ice trends between the Arctic and Antarctic regions.

Get answers to these and other frequently asked questions.", "content": "Is the globe warming? Yes, our world is warming at an unusually rapid rate, and this is now the warmest period in the history of modern civilization.   Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by 1.8°F (1.0°C) since the late 1800s, an average rate of 0.13° F (0.07° C) per decade. Since 1981, the rate of warming has more than doubled to 0.32°F (0.18°C) per decade. The six warmest years in the 1880–2020 record have all occurred since 2014, while 19 of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2001.   With significant reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases, the annual global surface temperature rise this century could be limited to 3.6°F (2°C) or less. Without major reductions in these emissions, the increase in annual average global temperatures relative to preindustrial times could reach 9°F (5°C) or more by the end of this century.   Learn more   and  . Did global warming stop in 1998? No, our world continued warming after 1998.   Thanks to natural climate variability, volcanic eruptions, and to a smaller extent, low solar activity, the rate of average global   warming from 1998–2013 was slower than it had been over the two preceding decades. Such varations in the rate of warming from decade to decade are common.   Meanwhile, excess heat continued to accumulate in the deeper layers of the ocean, contributing to marine heat waves and sea level rise.   The slowdown in surface warming was only temporary, however, as the six warmest years in recorded history have all occurred after 2013.   Learn more     and  Can we trust NOAA’s global temperature data record? Yes, we can trust the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) data for three key reasons: Are humans causing or contributing to global warming? Yes, by increasing the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, human activities are amplifying Earth’s natural greenhouse effect. Virtually all climate scientists agree that this increase in heat-trapping gases is the main reason for the 1.8°F (1.0°C) rise in global average temperature since the late nineteenth century.   Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and various chlorofluorocarbons are all human-emitted  . Among these, carbon dioxide is of greatest concern to scientists because it exerts a larger overall warming influence than the  . At present, humans are putting an estimated 9.5 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuels, and another 1.5 billion through deforestation and other land cover changes. Of this human-produced carbon, forests and other vegetation absorb around 3.2 billion metric tons per year, while the ocean absorbs about 2.5 billion metric tons per year. A net 5 billion metric tons of human-produced carbon remain in the atmosphere each year, raising the global average carbon dioxide concentrations by about 2.3 parts per million per year. Since 1750, humans have increased the abundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by nearly 50 percent.    . What is the difference between   and  ? Both phrases can have slightly different meanings in different contexts, but these days,   generally refers to the long-term increase in global average temperature as a result of human activity. Climate change is a much broader term that covers changes in multiple parts of the climate system, from temperature to precipitation to wind patterns. Climate change can be local, regional, or global, and it can have natural or human causes. Global warming is a type of climate change; however, not all climate change is global warming.  . What scientific evidence exists that Earth is warming and that humans are the main cause? We know the world is warming because people have been recording daily high and low temperatures at thousands of weather stations worldwide, over land and ocean, for many decades and, in some locations, for more than a century.   When different teams of climate scientists in different agencies (e.g., NOAA and NASA) and in other countries (e.g., the U.K.’s Hadley Centre) average these data together, they all find essentially the same result: Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by about 1.8°F (1.0°C) since 1880.  In addition to our surface station data, we have many different lines of evidence that Earth is warming ( ). Birds are migrating earlier, and their migration patterns are changing.   and   are moving north. Plants are blooming earlier in the spring. Mountain glaciers are melting and snow cover is declining in the Northern Hemisphere (Learn more   and  ). Greenland’s ice sheet—which holds about 8 percent of Earth’s fresh water—is melting at an accelerating rate ( ). Mean global sea level is rising ( ). Arctic sea ice is declining rapidly in both thickness and extent ( ). We know this warming is largely caused by human activities because the key role that carbon dioxide plays in maintaining Earth’s natural greenhouse effect has been understood since the mid-1800s. Unless it is offset by some equally large cooling influence, more atmospheric carbon dioxide will lead to warmer surface temperatures. Since 1800, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere   from about 280 parts per million to 410 ppm in 2019. We know from both its rapid increase and its isotopic “fingerprint” that the source of this new carbon dioxide is fossil fuels, and not natural sources like forest fires, volcanoes, or outgassing from the ocean. Finally, no other known climate influences have changed enough to account for the observed warming trend. Taken together, these and other lines of evidence point squarely to human activities as the cause of recent global warming. How do we know the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is caused by humans? The most basic reason is that fossil fuels—the equivalent of millions of years of plant growth—are the only source of carbon dioxide large enough to raise atmospheric carbon dioxide amounts as high and as quickly as they have risen. The increase between the year 1800 and today is 70 percent larger than the increase that occurred when Earth climbed out of the last ice age between 17,500 and 11,500 years ago, and it occurred 100–200 times faster.   In addition, fossil fuels are the only source of carbon consistent with the   of the carbon present in today’s atmosphere. That analysis indicates it must be coming from terrestrial plant matter, and it must be very, very old. These and other lines of evidence leave no doubt that fossil fuels are the primary source of the carbon dioxide building up in Earth’s atmosphere.  Isn’t there a lot of debate and disagreement among climate scientists about global warming? No. By a large majority, climate scientists agree with the following statements: This scientific consensus is clearly summarized in the climate assessment reports of the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.   NOAA scientists played lead roles in authoring and editing both sets of reports. Additionally, the United States’ foremost science agencies and organizations have all recognized global warming as a human-caused problem that threatens human and natural systems and, therefore, should be addressed. These agencies and organizations include (but are not limited to)  ; the  ; the  ; the  ; the  ; the  ; the  ; the  ; the  ; and the  . What is the difference between weather and climate?  is the short-term atmospheric conditions at a given location on a specific day and time.   is usually described as the long-term average weather at a given place, but it   the range of weather conditions that are possible at a given place, including the types and historical frequency of extreme events that occur there. By analogy, if the outcome of any given at-bat is like the weather, then a baseball player’s career batting average is like the climate. There’s an old saying: “Climate is what you expect; weather is what you get.” Another way to think about the difference between weather and climate is to say that a region’s climate is the background conditions that give rise to a location’s weather events. Because all weather occurs within Earth’s climate system, changes in the background state of the climate system can make different weather outcomes more or less likely to happen. For example, during the period from 1997-2018, the percentage area of the globe that experienced record-setting warm temperatures dwarfed the percentage area of the globe that experienced record-setting cold temperatures.   This was a predictable set of weather outcomes due to global warming.  . Why should I trust scientists’ climate projections for 50 or 100 years from now when they can’t accurately forecast the weather more than 2 weeks from now? In many ways, it is actually harder to forecast weather 2 weeks in advance than it is to forecast climate decades in advance because weather is about the   conditions and climate is about   conditions. Climate models are not trying, for example, to forecast the   daytime high temperature in Chicago, IL, on August 15, 2035. They are trying to forecast the   daytime high temperature for the   of August over the entire   of the 2030s. And while the exact weather conditions at a given location can change dramatically from hour to hour, the average   changes much less from year to year or even decade to decade. The difference in time scale means that our ability to predict future climate doesn’t depend on our ability to predict next week’s weather.  Not only are weather models predicting different things than climate models, they require different kinds of starting information. Modelers call weather forecasting an   problem because, at short time scales, the future atmospheric conditions depend mostly on the initial atmospheric conditions. The accuracy of your forecast for a given location depends heavily on how well you can describe these initial conditions, especially in the surrounding area. In contrast, most modelers describe a climate projection as a   problem because at long time scales (years to decades), future climate depends mostly on big-picture characteristics of the Earth system that don’t vary from day to day: the amount of land and ocean surface, the height and location of mountain ranges, the geometry of Earth’s orbit, and—crucially—the composition of the global atmosphere. These things define the boundaries of the climate system, the relatively narrow range of outcomes that are possible over long time frames. These fundamental differences between weather models and climate models, in both what they are trying to predict and what those predictions depend on, mean that the quality of a weather forecast two weeks out isn’t a good test of how well we can predict the climate two decades out. How do greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming? Different gases interact with light and heat energy in different ways. The chemical structure of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane, allows them to absorb some of the heat energy radiated from Earth’s surface. They re-radiate some of it back toward the surface, like the bricks in a chimney radiate warmth back into a room even after a fire goes out. This behavior is the foundation of Earth’s natural greenhouse effect, which   since the mid-1800s. The more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the more heat energy the atmosphere traps near the surface ( ), causing Earth’s surface temperature to rise. The initial warming due to increasing carbon dioxide kicks off several feedback loops: more water vapor, which is a powerful greenhouse gas; permafrost thaw and decomposition, which releases more methane and carbon dioxide; loss of sea ice and snow, which reduces the amount of sunlight the Earth reflects; and outgassing of additional carbon dioxide from the ocean. Together, these feedback loops make the actual warming two or more times larger than it would be due to carbon dioxide increases alone.  Which greenhouse gas is more important to Earth’s temperature: water vapor or carbon dioxide? Without our heat-trapping atmosphere, Earth’s surface temperature would be near freezing, instead of close to 60° Fahrenheit. Water vapor is directly responsible for about 50 percent of Earth’s natural greenhouse effect, while carbon dioxide accounts for about 20 percent.   So in terms of total warming, water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas. But without the background warmth provided by carbon dioxide—which doesn’t condense and rain out of the atmosphere as water vapor does—the atmosphere would be too cold to support much water vapor, and the entire greenhouse effect would collapse. Models indicate Earth would likely freeze over everywhere but the equator.   So in terms of making the greenhouse effect  , carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. As the most abundant of the non-condensing  , carbon dioxide is the main control knob—the thermostat—of Earth’s greenhouse effect.   Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide from human activities are turning the thermostat up. As surface temperatures rise, more water evaporates, enhancing the initial warming. This water vapor feedback loop is powerful, at least doubling the warming provided by carbon dioxide alone.   But water vapor can’t act on its own to cause climate change; it can only amplify a change caused by the non-condensing greenhouse gases or other climate influences, such as variations in incoming sunlight. That means that when it comes to causing global warming, carbon dioxide is without question the most important greenhouse gas. Hasn’t Earth warmed and cooled naturally throughout history? Yes. Earth has experienced cold periods (or “ice ages”) and warm periods (“interglacials”) on roughly 100,000-year cycles for at least the last 1 million years. The last of these ices ended around 20,000 years ago. Over the course of these cycles, global average temperatures warmed or cooled anywhere from 3° to perhaps as much as 8° Celsius (5°-15° Fahrenheit).         It was partly through their attempts to understand   previous ice ages that climate scientists came to understand the dominant role that carbon dioxide plays in Earth’s climate system, and the role it is playing in current global warming. Learn more   and  .  Over at least the past million years,   have been triggered by   in how much sunlight reaches the Northern Hemisphere in the summer, which are driven by small variations in the geometry of Earth’s orbit around the Sun. But these fluctuations in sunlight aren’t enough on their own to bring about full-blown ice ages and interglacials. They trigger several   that amplify the original warming or cooling. During an interglacial, These feedbacks   until the Earth’s orbit goes through a phase during which the amount of Northern Hemisphere summer sunlight is minimized. Then these feedbacks operate in reverse, reinforcing the cooling trend. Doesn’t carbon dioxide in the atmosphere come from natural sources? Yes, there are natural sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide, such as outgassing from the ocean, decomposing vegetation and other biomass, venting volcanoes, naturally occurring wildfires, and even belches from ruminant animals. These natural sources of carbon dioxide are offset by “sinks”—things like photosynthesis by plants on land and in the ocean, direct absorption into the ocean, and the creation of soil and peat. During all the ice ages that have occurred over at least the past million years, these opposing branches of the carbon cycle have kept the atmospheric carbon dioxide level at or below 300 parts per million (ppm).  , that level is close to 410 ppm. Not only is this the highest carbon dioxide has been during all of human civilization, it has reached these levels virtually instantaneously in geologic time frames. During ice age cycles of the past, a change this large would likely have taken thousands of years to occur. This extremely rapid build-up of carbon dioxide is happening because humans are putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere faster than natural sinks can remove it. By burning fossil fuels, we have essentially taken millions of years of carbon uptake by plants and returned it to the atmosphere in  .  Do volcanoes emit more carbon dioxide than humans? No, human activities emit 60 or more times the carbon dioxide that volcanoes do in a typical year. Estimates for carbon dioxide emissions from volcanoes range from 0.3 (plus or minus 0.15) billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year   to perhaps as much as 0.6 billion metric tons  , whereas human activities have been releasing more than 30 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year      Couldn’t the Sun cause the globe to warm? If the Sun were to intensify its energy output then, yes, it would warm our world. Indeed, sunspot data indicate there was a small increase in the amount of incoming sunlight between the late 1800s and the mid-1900s that experts estimate contributed to   up to 0.1°C of the 1.0°C (1.8°F) of warming observed since the pre-industrial era.   However, there has been no significant net change in the Sun’s energy output from the late 1970s to the present, which is when we have observed the most rapid global warming.  . A second reason that scientists have ruled out a significant role for the Sun in global warming is that if the Sun’s energy output had intensified, we would expect all layers of Earth’s atmosphere to have warmed. But we don’t see that. Rather, satellites and observations from weather balloons show warming in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and cooling in the upper stratosphere (stratosphere)—which is exactly what we would expect to see as a result of increasing greenhouse gases trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.   Scientists regard this piece of evidence as one of several “smoking guns” linking today’s global warming to human-emitted, heat-trapping gases. Do humans also exert a cooling influence on Earth’s climate? Yes, humans exert a cooling influence on Earth in several ways. But, overall, these   are smaller than the warming influence of the heat-trapping gases humans put into the air.  Our greatest cooling influence comes from particulate pollution (aerosols) we produce. We put plumes of aerosols into the air from power plants and industrial smokestacks; smoke and gases from biomass burning; windblown dust from deforested areas, dried wetlands, and crop fields; exhaust from ships’ smokestacks; tailpipe emissions from cars, trucks, buses, and trains; etc. Aerosol particles absorb and reflect the sun’s rays, thereby reducing the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface. They also interact with clouds, in many cases making them brighter and longer-lived, also reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the surface.  . Whereas aerosols linger in the atmosphere from days to a few weeks, heat-trapping gases that we add to the atmosphere linger from decades to centuries. Plus, when scientists discovered that our aerosol emissions were causing other undesired harmful side effects—such as acid rain and human respiratory diseases and deaths—we began to regulate and reduce their emission. Thus, the warming effect of our heat-trapping gases is ultimately winning out over the cooling influence of our particle pollution.  . What role does the ocean play in global warming? The ocean has absorbed between 20–30 percent of all human-produced carbon dioxide emissions since the 1980s. This absorption has kept large amounts of this heat-trapping gas out of the atmosphere, making the rate of warming slower than it would otherwise be, but it has also lowered the pH (increased the acidity) of ocean surface waters.   makes it harder for shell-building marine life—including commercially and culturally valuable species such as coral, crabs, and oysters—to build and maintain their shells.  Because of its tremendous volume and high heat capacity, the ocean has absorbed more than 90 percent of all excess heat trapped in Earth's climate system by greenhouse gases. Currents mix much of that heat into deeper layers of the ocean, delaying the full impact of surface warming we would otherwise expect. However, the heating of deeper layers of the ocean still contributes to sea level rise, sea ice retreat, marine heatwaves, oxygen depletion and expanding dead zones, shifts in the ranges of several marine species, and accelerating loss of polar ice shelves.  Does global warming mean it’s warming everywhere? No, “global warming” means Earth’s annual average air temperature is rising over long time spans (many decades to centuries), but not necessarily   and not necessarily in all seasons. It’s like your grades—if you get Bs and Cs in your first semester and in the next semester you get all As and Cs, your overall grade point average rises even though you didn’t improve in every class. Differences in exposure to sunlight, cloud cover, atmospheric circulation patterns, aerosol concentrations, atmospheric humidity, land surface cover, etc., all vary from place to place which, in turn, influence whether and how much a location is warming or cooling. Learn more  ,  ,  , and  . What is an \"extreme event\"? Scientists can characterize an extreme event in three different ways:  Generally speaking, an extreme event is any event that ranks in the highest or lowest 5 percent or 10 percent of all historical observations of that type of event. The percentage threshold is arbitrary and is designated by a researcher to provide context on a given event or set of events. Scientists sometimes describe extreme events in terms of their “sigmas” (or their “standard deviation”), which is a measure of how far removed an individual value is from the average of all observations in a data set. So, if a climate expert describes a heavy rain event as a “5-sigma event,” s/he is talking about rainfall so extreme that it was 5 standard deviations away from the average rainfall for that location—way out at the tail end of the range of all values that have ever been observed.  . Another way of characterizing an extreme event is by describing the probability of occurrence in a given span of time. Based on historical observations, experts   to estimate the range of all possible events that we would eventually expect to observe if our data record was long enough. From this range of all possible values, they can pinpoint how frequently a particular value would be expected to recur within a given amount of time. For example, 100-year event means an event is so extreme that it has only a 1 percent chance (1 divided by 100) of happening in any given year. A thousand-year event has a 0.1 percent chance of happening in any single year (1 divided by 1,000).  . Was this or that extreme weather or climate event caused by global warming? To date, climate research has yet to show that any given event was caused   by global warming. However, over the past decade,   that climate change due to global warming has made many extreme events more likely, more intense, longer-lasting, or larger in scale than they would have been without it. For many of the events that have been studied, global warming has been identified as the primary driver of the event, not just a supporting player. And a number of recent studies have concluded that certain heat-related extreme events would not have been possible without human-caused global warming. Learn more   and  .  is the science of figuring out what caused a given extreme weather or climate event, and weighting the relative influence of global warming versus natural variability. The biggest collection of research dedicated to understanding the causes of extreme events is published annually in a special issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. The most recent edition of the report,   was the eighth in the series. (The report covering a selection of events from 2019 is soon to be released). Together, these eight reports have documented 168 attribution studies, 73 percent of which identified a substantial link between an extreme event and human-caused climate change, whereas 27 percent did not. To learn more, go   and  If Earth has warmed and cooled naturally, why are scientists so concerned about today’s global warming? Experts are concerned about today’s global warming because it is different from previous warming periods in three key ways: the reason, the rate, and the repercussions. Ice ages and warm periods over the past million years or more were triggered by variations in the amount of sunlight reaching the Northern Hemisphere during summer and then amplified by other climate feedbacks. But today’s warming is mainly due to humans increasing the abundance of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.  Today’s warming is occurring much more quickly than previous interglacial episodes. In transitions from an ice age to an interglacial, it took 5,000–10,000 years for the temperature to rise between 5 and 9° Fahrenheit (3–5° Celsius). Humans could witness the same amount of global warming within the next 80 years if we continue emitting heat-trapping gases at today’s rate.  Finally, if we cause our world to warm by 2.7°F (1.5°C) or more compared to the temperatures before the start of the Industrial Revolution, scientists warn that there will be harmful repercussions for human health, the economy, infrastructure, and agriculture and natural resources.   The greater the warming above that threshold, the more widespread and severe the impacts are likely to be. Human and natural systems that cannot adapt quickly enough may be overwhelmed. A global warming of 1.8°F (1°C) seems small, given that some locations experience temperature swings of 30°F or more in a single day. Why is this change in global temperature a concern? Daily temperature swings of tens of degrees at a given location are common weather-driven events. But historically, when measurements of the daily high and low temperatures from many thousands of locations all over the world are averaged together over a whole year, the Earth's annual average temperature fluctuated by   from year to year. In a geological context, a global-scale warming of 1.8°F (1°C) in less than 150 years is an unusually large temperature change in a relatively short span of time. It's also important to recognize that Earth is not warming uniformly, nor is it expected to. Middle and high latitudes in general will warm more than the tropics, and land surface temperatures will rise more than ocean temperatures. Over the long term, land masses at the latitude of the United States are expected to warm much more than the global average.   If global warming continues at an increasing rate, in several decades the world is likely to be warmer than it's been for over a million years, with unpredictable consequences for humans and the natural resources we depend on. How will global warming harm human health and well-being in the United States? More  . More  . How will global warming harm natural and agricultural resources in the United States? The ability of forests and other ecosystems to provide culturally and economically important services—timber, water supply protection, livestock forage, recreation, fisheries, and hunting—are likely to decline as a result of human-caused climate change due to increased disturbance from water stress, fires, pest outbreaks, invasive species, heat stress, ocean acidification, and drought. These negative impacts will increase with higher rates of warming.      In terms of biodiversity, adaptable species with wide geographic ranges—such as white-tailed deer and feral hogs—are likely to continue to thrive. But those species that depend on particular habitats—polar and alpine species, coral reefs, coldwater fishes—are vulnerable, as are the communities that depend on them culturally and economically.   According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, “[S]pecies, including many iconic species, may disappear from regions where they have been prevalent or become extinct, altering some regions so much that their mix of plant and animal life will become almost unrecognizable.”  Food and forage production will decline in agricultural regions experiencing increased frequency and duration of drought. Even without drought, higher temperatures will increase evaporation of soil moisture, increasing crop stress and water demand—further stressing U.S. surface and groundwater supplies used for irrigation. And even with irrigation, many commodity crops are likely to experience declines in average yield as temperatures rise beyond their preferred heat tolerance range. Milder winters and shifts in precipitation are likely to increase the incidence of pests and diseases for crops and livestock, while extreme heat—especially nighttime heat—will reduce livestock productivity. Impacts will vary from region to region, depending on the extent of warming and the level of adaptation.  .  How will global warming harm U.S. communities, infrastructure, and the economy? Nationwide, the cost of weather and climate-related disasters is already rising,   and the trend is likely to continue as many extreme events become more frequent and severe. The economic impacts of extreme events include not just the direct damages, but also the loss of productivity and interruption of essential services and supply chains that can reach deep into the national economy.  In many parts of the country, existing infrastructure—septic and stormwater systems, roads, bridges, the energy grid—was not designed to cope with current and future sea level and climate extremes, and current levels of investment aren’t enough to cover necessary repairs and upgrades.    Beyond extreme events, human-caused climate change is likely to disrupt many sectors of the U.S. economy and the communities that depend on them, including commercial and recreational fisheries, tourism and recreation, and agriculture.      Are there benefits from global warming? Yes, there will probably be some short-term and long-term benefits from global warming. For example, the flip side of increased mortality from heat waves may be decreased mortality from cold waves. In the short term, farmers in some regions may benefit from the earlier onset of spring and from a longer warm season that is suitable for growing crops. Also, studies show that, up to a certain point, crops and other plants grow better in the presence of higher carbon dioxide levels and seem to be more drought-tolerant.   But this benefit is a two-edged sword: weeds, many invasive plant species, and insect pests will also thrive in a warmer world. Water availability will be impacted in drier agricultural areas that need irrigation. At some point, the benefits to crops of increased carbon dioxide will likely be overwhelmed by the negative impacts of heat stress and drought. In the long term, shipping commerce will benefit from the opening of the Northwest Passage for longer periods of the year due to the loss of Arctic sea ice. However, in the long run, if a \"business as usual\" approach to emitting heat-trapping gases is maintained at the present rate, or faster, then the negative costs and impacts of global warming are very likely to far outweigh the benefits over the course of this century, with increased potential for catastrophic impacts from more extreme events.   In part, this is because any substantial change, whether warmer or colder, would challenge the societal infrastructure that has developed under the current climate. Can we slow or stop human-caused global warming? Yes.  While we cannot stop global warming overnight, or even over the next several decades, we can slow the rate and limit the amount of global warming by reducing human emissions of heat-trapping gases and soot (“black carbon”).  If all human emissions of heat-trapping gases were to stop today, Earth’s temperature would continue to rise for a few decades as ocean currents bring excess heat stored in the deep ocean back to the surface. Once this excess heat radiated out to space, Earth’s temperature would stabilize. Experts think the additional warming from this “hidden” heat is unlikely to exceed 0.9° Fahrenheit (0.5°Celsius).   With no further human influence, natural processes would begin to slowly remove the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and global temperatures would gradually begin to decline. It’s true that without dramatic action in the next couple of decades, we are unlikely to keep global warming in this century below 2.7° Fahrenheit (1.5° Celsius) compared to pre-industrial temperatures—a threshold that experts say offers a lower risk of serious negative impacts.   But the more we overshoot that threshold, the more serious and widespread the negative impacts will be, which means that it is never “too late” to take action. What actions can we take to stop or slow global warming? There is no one-size-fits-all approach to stopping or slowing global warming, and each individual, business, municipal, state, tribal, and federal entity must weigh their options in light of their own unique set of circumstances.   it is likely many strategies working together will be needed. Generally speaking, here are some examples of mitigation strategies we can use to slow or stop the human-caused global warming ( ): Note that NOAA doesn’t advocate for or against particular climate policies.

Meanwhile, the ocean's heating imbalance continued to climb.", "content": "No, but thanks to natural variability, volcanic eruptions, and relatively low solar activity, the rate of average global surface warming from 1998-2012 was slower than it had been for two to three decades leading up to it. How   slower depends on the fine print:   you look at, whether it includes the Arctic, and the   you compare. Regardless, the big picture of long-term global warming remained unchanged. ( ) Based on NOAA data, global average surface temperature (orange line) has risen 0.13°F (0.07°C) per decade since 1880 (red line), which is nearly identical to the rate of warming during the 15-year period from 1998-2012 (gray line).

Those who deny the scientific evidence of   turned the slowdown into a slogan: “Global warming stopped in 1998.” In scientific journals and assessment reports, climate experts described the episode as a “pause” or “hiatus” in the previous decades’ rapid warming: they knew it wouldn’t last.

Like a hiking trail over hilly terrain, the global surface temperature can rise steeply, level out, or even fall for short “distances.” Overall, though, it’s a climb from the trailhead to the summit. NOAA Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh. Like previous episodes in the historical record, the slowdown in the rate of surface warming during the early twenty-first century was temporary. Global average surface temperatures set a new record in 2014, again in 2015, and   in 2016. The rate of surface warming since the late 1980s has been more than twice as fast as the warming averaged over the entire historical record.

Maps by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NOAA NCEI. The relative slowdown in surface warming from 1998-2012 compared to the preceding decades was just the latest example of the short-term cooling influences overlapping with the long-term global warming trend. The slowdown in surface warming from 1998­­–2012 relative to previous decades started with one of the strongest El Niño events on record. El Niño is the warm phase of a powerful   in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Niño emerges irregularly every few years, taking turns with La Niña, its cool-phase partner. The pattern is anchored in the tropics, but it has a global impact. In any given decade, the warmest years are usually El Niño years; the coldest are usually La Niña ones. [See   in our El Niña/La Niña FAQ.] The   contributed to the largest (at the time) one-year jump in global average surface temperature on record, helping to make 1998 the warmest year of the twentieth century. Choosing a record-warm year as the starting point for a trend analysis increases the odds of  . The influence of that record-warm El Niño year on short-term temperature trends was amplified by a heavy tilt toward La Niña events over the next 15 years. Following the strong 1997-98 El Niño, La Niña events (blue shading) outnumbered El Niño events (red shading) over the next 15 years, contributing to the 1998-2012 surface warming slowdown. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, based on   from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. Often, El Niño and La Niña events are embedded within the warm and cool phases of an even larger-scale climate pattern: the   (“PDO” for short). The PDO influences surface temperature across the entire Pacific north of the equator. As its name implies, the PDO   its warm or cool phases for a decade or more at a time. Around 2000, the cool phase became more common. During the cool phases of the PDO, prevailing winds drive strong ocean circulations that push heated surface water deeper into the ocean and draw cooler water up to the surface. Heat doesn’t disappear; it just doesn’t all show up at the surface. During the early twenty-first century, observations of the water column down to depths of 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) showed excess heat continued to accumulate in the ocean. Water has tremendous heat capacity. Natural variations in winds and currents can shift heat from the surface to deeper parts of the ocean. Observations of the amount of heat energy stored in the top 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) of the ocean show that ocean heating continued during the surface warming slowdown. NOAA Climate.gov, adapted from Figure 1 in Cheng et al., 2017. The Sun has an 11-year geomagnetic cycle. From the peak to the minimum, the average amount of energy reaching the top of Earth’s atmosphere varies by about 0.1%. It’s a small difference: in an average cycle, it’s only enough to warm or cool Earth’s surface temperature by approximately 0.05 degrees Celsius. (There also appears to have been a small, long-term increase in solar activity in the early twentieth century, which added to the human-caused global warming trend during that period). The solar cycles that coincided with the 1998-2012 surface warming slowdown were below average. Solar cycle 23 had an unusually long and low minimum, and solar cycle 24 had the lowest maximum in more than a century. The relatively weak solar activity made a small contribution to slowing surface warming in the early part of the new century.

The minimum of solar cycle 23 was unusually drawn out, and the maximum of the next cycle was among the lowest of the past century.

Sulfur dioxide reacts with water vapor to produce sulfate particles. These aerosol particles act like billions of tiny mirrors, reflecting a fraction of incoming sunlight. Most eruptions aren’t powerful enough to influence the climate on a global scale. But an eruption that is powerful enough to reach the  —especially in the tropics, where the particles spread easily to both hemispheres—can cool the climate for several years. Soufriere Hills Volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat erupted repeatedly in the first decade of the twenty-first century, most notably in 2002, 2006, and 2009. On October 11, 2009, an astronaut on the International Space Station captured this image of a volcanic plume of ash and gases towering over the southwestern corner of the island. Image courtesy NASA-JSC Gateway to Astronaut Photography of the Earth. Normally, when we talk about climate-scale eruptions, we are talking about cataclysmic events like the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. While we haven’t seen any   eruptions like that in recent years, a number of moderate eruptions took place in the tropics between 2000-2010. Together, these eruptions—especially the 2006 eruptions of Montserrat’s Soufriere Hills Volcano and Papua New Guinea’s Tavurvur Volcano—gradually boosted the amount of light-reflecting particles in the stratosphere during the warming slowdown period. Stratospheric haze peaked following the cataclysmic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, was low throughout the mid- to late 1990s, and gradually built back up in the first decade of the 2000s due to moderate but frequent eruptions of tropical volcanoes. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, based on SAGE, GOMOS, and CALIPSO data provided by Jean-Paul Vernier. In order to verify the combined impact of these cooling influences on surface temperatures, experts have turned to virtual worlds simulated by computer-driven mathematical climate models. Experiments have demonstrated that both Pacific Ocean variability and random atmospheric variations are each capable of generating a surface warming slowdown that matches the 1998-2012 period, not just in amount, but also in its geographic details. When models also include observed patterns of volcanic aerosols and low solar activity, temperatures projections match observations even more closely.

Graphs by NOAA Climate.gov, adapted from Figure 5 in Medhaung, et al., 2017. The surface warming slowdown between 1998 and 2012 turned into a great opportunity for climate experts to take a fresh look at the influence of all the players in the climate game, to scrutinize observational records, and to test models.

The most commonly measured climate variables are temperature and precipitation, the latter being available for more than 100,000 locations worldwide. Some stations (such as those at airports) also observe additional variables—including pressure, wind, and cloud cover—on an hourly basis. Coverage of the stations is sparse in some regions; however, most airports have a station. Many modeling applications require data in locations that do not have weather stations. Gridded datasets bridge this gap. These datasets consist of estimated data at evenly spaced intervals, such as every 5 kilometers. Researchers construct these datasets by using station data in combination with statistical methods (e.g., by interpolating station data to a uniform grid or fitting a statistical surface through the original observations). Gridded datasets are valuable in many modeling applications that require evenly spaced data as input. They are also useful in computing averages for societally relevant areas, such as counties and census tracts. Interpolated grids estimate unknown values at locations by using nearby points where values are known.  Comprehensive Climate Monitoring data, also known as Reanalysis datasets, are produced by running climate models over a historical period while constraining many of the values of the model to match observed values. These data are multivariate, spatially and temporally complete, and gridded. This process provides a consistent high-resolution output that smooths over data gaps by providing the best possible estimate of the true values by using both observations and models to estimate what value most likely would have been observed. For example, in a reanalysis for the period from 1950 to 2000, if a station was only active from 1970 onward, the 20 years of missing values can be estimated by constraining the model using existing observations that were active so that the temperature (and other values) that might have been observed at that station can be filled in.  Climate models break the globe into a 3-dimensional grid and simulate a large number of variables in each grid cell at each time step using fundamental physics equations. Climate models are “spun up” by initializing them with observations and letting them run over many years of timesteps, solving the equations for each grid cell during each step, and allowing for interactions between adjacent grid cells. Climate model output should be used to estimate longer-term, probabilistic climate statistics rather than to predict deterministic values.  A Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) is a product containing outputs from one or more models from different modeling centers that have been averaged together to create what is called an ensemble. In some cases, more than one model run (realization) per model is included, and each realization is run with slightly perturbed parameters to better represent uncertainty in the MME mean. MMEs are often more skillful than individual models, and better represent prediction error, because the ensemble as a whole balances out individual model biases to some extent.   \t\t\tPython This page is developed through NOAA’s One Health Team to serve the COVID-19 and broader health research and decision making community.

Knowing a region’s climate classification can be useful when choosing building materials for protection and durability, or when considering what crops are likely (or unlikely) to thrive in a region. For visitors, knowing a location’s climate classification can help them select appropriate clothing to pack. Geographers recognize a number of factors that affect a region’s climate: Together, these factors control the range of temperatures and the amount of rain and/or snow each region receives through the year. These factors control climate, and in turn, climate controls ecology—the types of native plants and animals that live in a region. Map by  , Finlayson, B. L., and McMahon, T. A. (University of Melbourne) via  . Long-term records of temperature and precipitation reveal climate patterns across continents, delineating them into climate regions. For example, the image on the right shows the  . Class names for classification systems based on weather patterns often include geographical names such as polar, tropical, continental, and marine. These terms are modified by terms describing temperature and moisture, or the intensity of weather during summer or winter.  Examples of descriptors used in this method of classification include moist or dry, warm or cold, and temperate or severe. Putting them together results in climate classifications such as \"polar marine\" and \"temperate continental.\" Map by Ville Koistinen,  , via  Environmental indicators such as the range of native vegetation that thrives in a place can be used to classify a region's climate. As plant species can only thrive within a specific range of temperature and moisture conditions, it follows that those conditions must be present if the plants thrive in that location. If the climate is not suitable—too wet, too dry, or too cold in winter, for example—plants (and the animals that depend upon them for food or habitat) will struggle or die.  These classification systems also utilize geographic terms, but are modified by biome names. Class names based on environmental indicators include names such as Arctic tundra, subtropical rainforest, and montane forests. Image by Peter Halasz,  , via  . The   Classification scheme uses latitude, altitude, and humidity to identify a region's climate (see the diagram at right; click for a larger view). As classifications are based on plotting just three physical parameters—the straightforward system has become popular in modeling climate change impacts.

Throughout Earth's history, global and regional climate has changed on very long time scales, and many of the past conditions can be discovered by studying natural records.  Paleoclimatology is the study of natural systems that record climate conditions. Analyses of growth patterns in tree rings, corals, and cave structures can help us deduce conditions that existed hundreds to millions of years ago. Data that come from natural sources instead of from instruments are called proxy records. The word \"proxy\" indicates that these records stand in for direct measurements. Tree-core drill and wood core samples next to a tree slab. Dendrochronologists (tree-time scientists) count the number of growth rings and record the pattern of their widths. The pattern of varying widths can be matched against those of other tree rings to tell their age. Photo by Hannes Grobe  . One of the most easily recognized types of paleoclimate records is tree ring data. Trees that grow a single annual ring can preserve a record of the conditions they experienced each year. Rocks deposited by glaciers are another example of proxy records. Scientists can recognize the distinctive pattern of sediments in rocks deposited by glaciers. Wherever they find glacial rocks then, they know that glaciers were present in that location at some point in the past. Once they examine fossils and other clues about when the rocks were deposited, they use the information to reconstruct the climate story for that location.  Other sources of proxy data for climate include lake and ocean sediments, layers of ice (cored from ice sheets), corals, fossils, and historical records from ship logs and early weather observers.  The most familiar methods to interpret natural records involve taking a core sample of the thing that produced the natural record. Field scientists use specialized equipment to take cores from trees, corals, sediments, and ice. By measuring the width, chemical composition, and physical structure of each layer in the core, scientists can deduce the conditions present when each layer formed.  Another way to learn about past climate is to take the temperature of rocks at different depths by mounting thermometers at different depths within boreholes drilled directly into the Earth’s crust. Rocks respond very slowly to changes in surface temperature conditions, and deeper rocks change temperatures more slowly than shallower rocks. Precise measurements of the rate of temperature change of rocks at various depths can be correlated to past temperatures at the surface. More about boreholes, including links to borehole data: Paleoclimate records become even more valuable when scientists compare information collected from locations around the world. Comparing their analyses, they have identified common patterns of temperature trends that are broadly consistent across a variety of data collection methods. By comparing multiple sets of proxy records, scientists have been able to reconstruct a fairly consistent story of Earth’s climate for the past few thousand years. See  While the methods of calculating global average temperature from different proxies vary from team to team, the outcomes are broadly consistent over time, and they converge with the instrumental record. The broad agreement of several datasets increases our confidence that proxies reveal valid temperature records.

Over the past century, though, global average temperatures have \"risen from near the coldest to the warmest levels\" in the past 11,300 years, the 2013 study authors explain. Over this same period, emissions of heat-trapping gases from human activities have increased. Given the uncertainty inherent in estimating ancient temperatures, the scientists conservatively concluded that the last decade has brought global average temperatures higher than they have been for at least 75 percent of the last 11,300 years.

NOAA Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh. Another distinction between global warming and climate change is that when scientists or public leaders talk about   these days, they almost always mean  -caused warming—warming due to the rapid increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from people burning coal, oil, and gas. Climate change, on the other hand, can mean human-caused changes or natural ones, such as ice ages. Besides burning fossil fuels, humans can cause climate changes by emitting aerosol pollution—the tiny particles that reflect sunlight and cool the climate— into the atmosphere, or by transforming the Earth's landscape, for instance, from carbon-storing forests to farmland. The planet has experienced climate change before: the Earth’s average temperature   throughout the planet’s 4.54 billion-year history. The planet has experienced long cold periods (\"ice ages\") and warm periods (\"interglacials\") on 100,000-year cycles for at least the last million years. Previous warming episodes were triggered by small increases in how much sunlight reached Earth’s surface and then amplified by large releases of carbon dioxide from the oceans as they warmed (like the fizz escaping from a warm soda). Increases and decreases in global temperature during the naturally occurring ice ages of the past 800,000 years, ending with the early twentieth century. NOAA Climate.gov graph by Fiona Martin, based on EPICA Dome C ice core   provided by the Paleoclimatology Program at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Today’s global warming is overwhelmingly due to the increase in heat-trapping gases that humans are adding to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. In fact, over the last five decades, natural factors (solar forcing and volcanoes) would actually have led to a slight cooling of Earth’s surface temperature. Global warming is also different from past warming in its rate. The current increase in global average temperature appears to be occurring much faster than at any point since modern civilization and agriculture developed in the past 11,000 years or so—and probably faster than any interglacial warm periods over the last million years. Temperatures over most of the past 2000 years compared to the 1961-1990 average, based on proxy data (tree rings, ice cores, corals) and modern thermometer-based data. Over the past two millenia, climate warmed and cooled, but no previous warming episodes appear to have been as large and abrupt as recent global warming.

Regardless of whether you say that climate change is all the side effects of global warming, or that global warming is one symptom of human-caused climate change, you’re essentially talking about the same basic phenomenon: the build up of excess heat energy in the Earth system.  So why do we have two ways of describing what is basically the same thing? According to  , the use of more than one term to describe different aspects of the same phenomenon tracks the progress of scientists’ understanding of the problem. As far back as the late 1800s, scientists were hypothesizing that industrialization, driven by the burning of fossil fuels for energy, had the potential to modify the climate. For many decades, though, they weren’t sure whether cooling (due to reflection of sunlight from pollution) or warming (due to greenhouse gases) would dominate. By the mid-1970s, however, more and more evidence suggested warming would dominate and that it would be unlike any previous, naturally triggered warming episode. The phrase “global warming” emerged to describe that scientific consensus. Change in temperature (degrees per century) from 1900-2014. Gray areas indicate where there is insufficient data to detect a long-term trend. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on   from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. But over subsequent decades, scientists became more aware that global warming was not the only impact of excess heat absorbed by greenhouse gases.  Other changes—sea level rise, intensification of the water cycle, stress on plants and animals—were likely to be far more important to our daily lives and economies. By the 1990s, scientists increasingly used “human-caused climate change” to describe the challenge facing the planet. Today’s global warming is an unprecedented type of climate change, and it is driving a   in our climate system. It’s these side effects, such as changes in sea level along heavily populated coastlines and the worldwide retreat of mountain glaciers that millions of people depend on for drinking water and agriculture, that are likely to have a much greater impact on society than temperature change alone.

The climate “bones” are all the observations we have. Since we have an admittedly incomplete set of weather observations, we have to use what we’ve got to create an image of the actual climate “dinosaur.” Let’s work through it with a real-life example. I have compiled over 80 years’ worth of daily rainfall observations from the Beckley VA Hospital in West Virginia, near where June rains were so extraordinary. First, I eliminated any year with more than 10 days of missing data. Next, I pulled the highest daily rainfall amount that occurred in each year (1). Some years clearly have larger daily rainfall maximums than others. Annual maximum daily precipitation totals from 1909 to 2015 at a weather station located at Beckley VA Hospital in West Virginia. Years where more than 10 days of precipitation data were missing are excluded. NOAA Climate.gov based on data from the  .

Annual maximum precipitation totals (inches) sorted from smallest to largest for 82 years at Beckley VA hospital in Beckley, West Virginia. The annual maximum precipitation total exceeded 4 inches in only two of the 82 years.

For that, we need to sort the values into bins defined by rainfall amount (a bin for 0 inches, 0-0.25, 0.25-0.5 inches etc), like sorting clothes into piles based on size. It is at this step, that we can begin to see if there is a pattern. A histogram of annual daily maximum precipitation totals for Beckley, West Virginia. There are 82 years in total. Precipitation totals are sorted into 0.25-inch bins.

It is clear that some yearly 24-hour rainfall maximums occur more often than others. In 18 of 80 years, the highest 24-hour rainfall was between 2 and 2.25 inches. In 15 years, the highest daily rainfall total was between 1.75 and 2.0 inches. Only one time in 80 years was there a daily record above 5 inches. However, the other thing that is clear is that the spread is incomplete. In this example, there are no years in which the highest daily rainfall total was between 4 and 4.5 inches, but there are some cases between 4.5-4.75 inches and 5.25-5.5 inches. It’s not physically plausible that the atmosphere would just never produce those rain amounts. It’s more logical to assume that if we had enough data going far enough back or forward in time, that there would eventually be a daily event filling in the gaps. This is where statistics come in. Scientists apply what they call a “distribution” (the dark line in the figure below), a relationship of the magnitude of the rainfall to how often that rainfall amounts occurs (2). The distribution line is like the final picture of the dinosaur. It uses the observations (bones) as the input for a reconstruction of the whole climate picture. The observations from Beckley, WV, of the frequency of rain events of different sizes (dots inside bars) can be used to estimate the full range of likely events and their frequency (dark line). This statistical estimate is called the  , and it's like the process of using the bones from an incomplete dinosaur skeleton to describe what the complete creature probably looked like. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NCEI. And now, researchers can see how often an event of   rainfall amount is likely to occur. In fact, if we consider the total area under the curve (dark line) and recognize that it must equal 1.0 (100%), then the probability of a single event of a given size occurring at some point is simply the area under that portion of the curve. The probability of a yearly daily maximum rainfall event greater than 4 inches, for example, is just the area from 4 on the x-axis to the right, bounded by the distribution line. In this type of graph, the curved line marks a hypothetical list of all possible extreme rainfall events, with the caveat that the total area under the curved line must equal 1.0 or 100%. The percent chance of any single rain event being more than a specific amount is the percent of the total area to the right of that rainfall amount. The percent chance of a rain event less than or equal to that threshold can be found by subtracting the area to the right of the threshold from 100. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov. Since we can figure out the probability for a given rainfall amount, we can also figure out what rainfall amounts correspond to specific probabilities like 0.1%, or said another way, a 1-in-1,000 year event (1/1000).   Using the area under the line, we can also flip the calcuation. Instead of finding the percent chance of an event of a certain size, we can find the amount of rain associated with an event of a certain probability. In Beckley, WV, the amount of rain associated with an event that has 0.1% chance of ocurring is 7.25 inches. Because a 0.1% chance is the same as 0.001, or 1 in 1,000, such events have been nicknamed \"thousand-year\" events.\" Graph by NOAA Climate.gov. Is the statistical estimate perfect? Of course not. There are many different types of distributions used for different variables, depending on what assumptions you make about the phenomenon you’re talking about.  You can even use different distributions for the same variable like precipitation! The distribution is an assumption, after all. And for events which are very rare, there is a great deal of uncertainty. Small differences in what a distribution line looks like at the extremes can have large impacts on the probabilities of uncommon events. Therefore, scientists can be more confident in the rainfall amounts needed for a 1-in-100-year storm than a 1-in-1,000-year event, and they often don’t even bother to estimate out beyond that. This story's example, in particular, is a much simpler version of the   already done by NOAA scientists. The return periods (0 to 1000 years) for rainfall amounts from 0 to over 7 inches based on 82 years of annual daily maximum precipitation data from Beckley, West Virginia. A 1 in 1000 year event, as calculated using the basic statistical technique of applying a distribution, would mean daily rainfall amounts of over 7 inches. During the event just north of this location on June 23, 2016, over 8 inches of rain fell in some locations in just 24 hours. NOAA Climate.gov figure based on data from the  .  To bring it back to the dinosaur picture, when I was growing up, dinosaurs had no feathers. Nowadays, feathered dinosaurs are much more widely accepted. What happened? More data and a better understanding led to a change in the picture (or the distribution, if we are talking rain). The same can happen here. More observations and research can help fine tune the climate picture. At the start of every school year, I used to guess what the chances of extreme weather events that year would be. As a typical kid, I remember always guessing (or hoping) that there was a 50% chance we would get a foot of snow at some point that winter that would cancel school. But I have no control over the likelihood of extreme events; only Mother Nature does (disregarding for a second how human-caused climate change can affect things).  There are different chances for all possible weather events. What the distribution shows us is that some events are more likely than others. There is a high chance, for instance, that at some point in the next year it rains more than 0.25 inches in West Virginia. There are also events that are so extreme that their chance of occurring in any given year is pretty small. If an event has only a 1% chance of happening in a year, that is equivalent to 1 divided by 100, or said another way a 1-in-100-year storm. A one-in-a-thousand year event would have a 0.1% chance (1 divided by 1,000) of occurring in any given year. The 1-day rainfall amounts that have have a 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% chance of occuring each year. Over very long periods of time, such events are likely to occur with an average frequency of 1-in-100, 1-in-500, or 1-in-1,000 years. Maps and animation by NOAA Climate.gov, based on  . Importantly, this is not saying that if a thousand-year event occurs that you have to wait another 1,000 years for the next one. There can be multiple events of that magnitude within 1,000 years or none. All that is being said is that there is a 0.1% chance of that event occurring in any given year.  We can even calculate the probability that a thousand-year event will occur during an arbitrary millennium.  If there is a 0.1% chance the event occurs in any year, it also means there is a 99.9% chance it won’t.  The probability of not seeing the event 1,000 years in a row would be equal to 0.999 (99.9%) raised to the 1000  power (# of years), which equals a 36.8% chance that the 1-in-1000-year event will not occur during any single randomly chosen 1,000-year time period, and a 63.2% chance that it will. Yup. When scientists are attempting to paint a picture of the climate using past observations, it is best if the climate is not changing that much. A changing climate means relying on a past that may not be as helpful.  In fact, global warming can   of a climate variable entirely. For instance, according to the   issued in 2012 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it is likely that a 1 in 20 year extreme 24-hour precipitation events will become a 1 in 5 to 15 year event by the end of the century in many regions. The picture could change, which leaves scientists in a tough position of figuring out the rarity of extreme events on one hand, while recognizing that the chances of these events may already be changing due to climate change on the other. (1) Another approach is to gather all of the largest events without the limitation of one per year. For example, if we were looking at 80 years’ worth of data, we would select the 80 largest events regardless of whether they occurred in the same year or not. This will lead to a slightly different dataset of extreme rainfall events but for this exercise, the conclusion would not be changed. (2) The y-axis here is showing values of the probability density function, which you can think of as frequency. Higher values mean more occurrences. The numbers themselves don’t matter as much as the line seen on the plot. The key feature of this plot is that the area underneath the dark black line equals 1.0 (1.0 in this case can be thought of as 100%). To determine the probability of an event occurring, the area under that portion of the curve equals the probability. Help us improve our content"},

Relative to pre-industrial times, today's atmosphere absorbs more than 3 extra watts of energy per square meter.", "content": "Among the most basic questions about global warming is how much are human-produced greenhouse gases influencing the climate today compared to the past? To answer this question, NOAA developed the Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (\"AGGI\" for short). Updated yearly, the AGGI calculates the combined warming influence of the most important long-lived greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous dioxide, and a number of industrial chemicals used in cooling and refrigeration, aerosol sprays, and other processes. The total direct heating influence in a given year is compared to conditions in 1990—the year that countries who signed the U.N. Kyoto Protocol agreed to use as a benchmark for their efforts to reduce emissions. The AGGI—short for Annual Greenhouse Gas Index—reports the combined warming influence of all long-lived greenhouse gases as a fraction of their influence in 1990. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on   from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab. Most of the warming influence (64 percent) is due to carbon dioxide. Methane is the second-largest contributor (19 percent).  The third-largest contributor is the   (CFCs) category (8.1 percent). (CFCs were widely used in cooling systems and aerosol sprays in the mid-1900s, before we realized they damaged the ozone layer. These substances and their replacements are now regulated under the Montreal Protocol, but they are extremely long-lived in the atmosphere, so they continue to play a role in Earth's heating imbalance.)  This graph shows the heating influence caused by the major human-produced greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (gray), methane (dark purple), nitrous oxide (medium purple), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, lavender), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs, blue), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs, light blue). Relative to conditions in 1750, today's atmosphere absorbs more than 3 extra watts of energy per square meter of Earth's surface. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov based on data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab. For the complete list of chemicals in the CFC, HFC, and HCFC groups, see Figure 3 in the Full AGGI Report.Graph by NOAA Climate.gov based on   from NOAA ESRL. All gases that make up Earth’s atmosphere are largely transparent to incoming sunlight. Sunlight warms the ocean and land surfaces, and those sun-warmed surfaces radiate heat back into the atmosphere in response. The most abundant gases in the atmosphere, oxygen and nitrogen, are transparent to this outgoing heat (thermal infrared radiation), allowing it to travel freely out to space. But greenhouse gases are   transparent to heat. They continually absorb heat energy and radiate it back into their surroundings—including back toward the Earth’s surface. Even after the Sun goes down, greenhouse gas molecules continue to radiate heat, like the bricks in a chimney radiate heat into a room even after a fire goes out. The ability of long-lived greenhouse gases to absorb and radiate heat is the heart of Earth's natural greenhouse effect. Without them, Earth's average surface temperature would be below freezing instead of around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, human activities have been adding heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere. By adding extra greenhouse gases, we are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect and causing Earth's surface temperature to rise.  Overall, since 1990, human-produced greenhouse gases have increased the heating power of the atmosphere by 1.11 Watts per square meter,  . Carbon dioxide is the big hitter, responsible for 78 percent of that increase. Changes in methane and  —most of the latter comes from soil microbes when crops are over-fertilized—are each responsible for about 7.5 percent of the increase. The remainder of the increase is from HCFCs and HFCs, each accounting for around 4 percent of the increase. The heating influence from the CFCs group has decreased over time as their manufacture slowed thanks to the Montreal Protocol.  Researchers in NOAA’s Global Monitoring Division calculate the AGGI using air samples collected every week at about 40 remote sites around the world. Technicians use state-of-the-art instruments to measure the abundance of greenhouse gases. From these observations, the researchers generate a smoothed global average. At the end of the year, the weekly data are combined into an annual average, which is then compared (indexed) to 1990. Indexing each year against 1990 makes it easier to compare one year to another. The year 1990 was chosen as the baseline year because it marked the first time that countries around the world seriously considered how they might work together to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases. Under the U.N. Kyoto Protocol, many industrialized nations around the world agreed to reduce their collective greenhouse gas emissions by about 5 percent of their 1990 amounts by 2012. Although the goals of this agreement have not been met, the year 1990 remains an important point of reference for efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. NOAA researchers have also calculated AGGI values back to the year 1750—the onset of the industrial revolution. To accomplish this, they used data on greenhouse gases concentrations estimated from air bubbles trapped in ice cores collected at a   around the globe. Using these historic data provide a   of humanity’s long-term influence on climate change. In  , experts from NOAA's Global Monitoring Lab wrote, \"This longer-term view shows how increases in greenhouse gas concentrations over the past ~70 years (since 1950) have accounted for nearly three-fourths (71%) of the total increase in the AGGI over the past 270 years.\" Montzka, S.

The role of our oceans—including ENSO—is key.", "content": "A blog   about monitoring and forecasting El Niño, La Niña, and their regional and global impacts...but sometimes about other climate phenomena that influence seasonal climate. The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA  ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA  ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA  ), with periodic guest contributors.

It is well known that the surface has warmed over the past few decades, primarily in response to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. ENSO variability and other natural factors, have additionally contributed toward year-to-year fluctuations about this warming trend (dark red line in Figure 1). Strong El Niño events add a few tenths of a degree Celsius to the global average surface temperatures. However, there has recently been an observed slowing in the rate of surface warming (compare the red and orange trend lines in Figure 1) which may be related in part to a   compared to previous decades (see ). Figure 1: Observed changes in global annual average surface temperature relative to 1961-1990 from the   which is   ( ). The temperature difference is compared with 1961-1990 average using data from Cowtan & Way (2014). The rate of warming from 1970-2013 (red trend line) is larger than the rate of warming between 1998-2013 (orange line).   On its own, though, ENSO is only part of the story, and it cannot fully explain how and why extra heat trapped by rising greenhouse gas concentrations is unable to raise surface temperatures; recent research indicates that, if anything, the Earth is  . How can warming at Earth’s surface have slowed when energy accumulation is becoming larger? The role of our oceans is central in answering this. As greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise, infra-red radiative cooling by the surface and the atmosphere (1) to space becomes less effective. This sends the planet out of balance, with more energy arriving through absorbed sunlight than leaving through infra-red radiation. Or to put simply, more energy stays on our planet than leaves, which results in the Earth warming. The heating effect is modified by knock-on effects which amplify or reduce climate change through vicious cycles or \"feedbacks.\" For example,  . This enhances the strength of the greenhouse effect, and therefore the overall heating effect, still further. Inexorable   have driven a radiative imbalance leading to global warming at the surface, which has been amplified by the associated increases in atmospheric moisture. These processes are crucial in explaining  . While ENSO influences Earth's overall heating rate and global surface temperatures from year to year (Figures 1-2), what explains the diminishing rate of surface warming over the longer period from the 1990s to the 2000s? A number of   (which make the planet reflect more sunlight) and a slightly   in the 2000s compared to the late 1990s are thought to have   effect of rising greenhouse gas concentrations. However, our   of satellite data, ocean measurements and detailed simulations (see Figure 2) indicates that Earth's heating rate has not diminished over the period 1985-2012. And if anything it has increased. Currently   at a rate approximately equivalent to every person worldwide using  . That's a big tea party. Figure 2: Changes in Earth's yearly average heating rate in observations and simulations 1985-2013 (adapted from  ). Shown here are an average of 9 simulations which applied observed surface temperatures and were adjusted to match the observed average heating rate over the 2005-2010 period. Earth loses heat following large volcanic eruptions such as Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 which injected aerosol particles into the stratosphere, reflecting more of the incoming sunlight back to space. Also important are changes in ocean circulation associated with ENSO: during the strongest El Niño events, such as 1997/8, warm ocean surface waters heat the atmosphere and more thermal infra-red radiation is emitted to space (there is a lag between the peak of the El Niño and the decrease in the heating rate of the planet) . Conversely, during La Niña events colder conditions in the east Pacific generally lead to a reduced rate at which energy is lost from the global oceans causing a greater overall heating rate of the planet (see above).   As we all know from boiling up a pan of vegetables for dinner, you have to put in quite a bit of energy to raise the temperature of water: approximately 4,000 Joules to heat a kilogram of water by 1 degree Celsius. And it turns out that Earth's capacity to take up heat is primarily determined by our vast oceans, all 1.4 billion billion tons of them (1.4×10 kg) (2). But only the upper layers of the ocean are well mixed over the course of a year or a decade. Exchanging energy between the surface layers and the deep sea (defined here as depths below 700 meters (2,300 feet)) can be a glacially slow processes for much of ocean. Observations and simulations demonstrate that   (in fact, a   indicates that observed warming in the upper 700 meters, shown in Figure 3, has been underestimated in the Southern hemisphere due to the sparse distribution of measurements). Some parts of the deep abyss (down below 4 kilometres, or 2.5 miles)   and   cannot detect a significant warming and associated contribution to sea level rise from layers deeper than 2000 meters (1.2 miles); many parts of the deep oceans are apparently still blissfully unaware that anything untoward is occurring at the surface!

Variability in ocean circulation associated with ENSO generally affects the way heat is mixed in the upper few hundred metres of the ocean (a recent   indicates that 85% of the year to year variability in sea level change due to thermal expansion of the upper 2000m of the ocean is explained by the upper 700m depth).    indicates that  , operating over longer timescales and at greater depth than the circulation changes associated with ENSO, are stealing some of the heat from the surface layers, thereby depriving the atmosphere of the warmth from the ocean surface.

It has been long appreciated that surface temperatures will not rise smoothly in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations; other heating and cooling factors including  ,   and   influence Earth's overall heating rate. And natural fluctuations within our vast oceans from one decade to the next determine what proportion of that heat warms the surface layers and what part is gobbled up by deeper levels. While a lot of the focus on ocean circulation revolves around ENSO, it is important to note there is much more that goes on within the vast oceans that can affect our climate. A further intriguing question is   Plus, it is yet to be established whether the unusual circulation patterns of the atmosphere and ocean   part of a natural fluctuation or whether greenhouse gas forcing has also played a role in   unusual oceanic conditions. Understanding these processes is vital in   associated with human activities, important for how we plan for and adapt to future climatic change. These are important topics of research being tackled by hundreds of scientists worldwide as detailed in the latest comprehensive assessment by the   and as documented by the growing pile of   steadily accumulating... just like heat in the oceans. (1) In order to stay in energy balance, the earth must emit energy equal to that which is absorbed from the sun. The process in which the Earth’s surface and atmosphere emit energy back to space is referred to as i  as our planet is “losing” heat. Greenhouse gases act to reduce the amount of energy that is emitted back to space by Earth, leaving more heat within the atmosphere, land and, in particular, the oceans, resulting in an imbalance as more energy from the sun is absorbed by the Earth than is emitted back to space. (2) If the heat currently accumulating was distributed evenly throughout the oceans, the temperatures of the entire ocean, including the sea surface, would rise by a paltry 0.017 degrees Celsius each decade. Observations show that the Earth is heating at   and since the global surface area is  , the buildup of energy is about 3×10 Joules per second which is 9.5×10 Joules per decade. Making a rough approximation, assuming the specific heat capacity of sea water is about 3,900 Joules per kg per degrees Celsius and the   this would mean that it would take 5.5×10 Joules (5.5 trillion trillion Joules) to heat the entire ocean by 1 degrees Celsius (1.8 degrees F). Then we simply divide the heating rate (9.5×10 Joules per decade) by 5.5×10 Joules per degrees Celsius to get 0.017 degrees Celsius per decade (so it would take about 600 years to raise the temperature by 1 degrees Celsius). In reality most of this energy has been heating the upper few hundred metres (see Figure 3 above), explaining why temperatures have been rising at around ten times this rate since 1970.

Building the capacity of students and teachers have been shown to have the greatest cost-benefit value for adaptation to climate change (Lutz et al. 2014). But while education can be one of the most efficient mechanism for changing individuals and communities climate related actions and improving climate literacy, it is still emerging how to best deliver it (Mochizuki and Bryan 2015). While many education programs around the world have done an excellent job building students’ knowledge around the causes of climate change, limited evidence exists that this knowledge is sufficient to change the actions responsible for climate change (Eilam and Trop 2012). Ironically, it is often the most educated that lead the most carbon intensive lifestyles, suggesting it is not more education that is needed, but different education. As this different and more effective educational practice is developed, educators and program developers can connect with others to share what works. The diverse professional networks above in step 5 are places where this new form of education is already being developed. Figure 3: ASU/MOS Communities are stepping up to address climate change impacts, serving as the primary incubators of social innovation and generating new strategies for sustainable living. Teachers can build knowledge of climate science and energy infrastructure, and encourage individuals to gain the skills, attitudes, and motivations they need to build sustainable communities. Tomorrow’s workforce must be able and willing to solve urgent challenges, such as climate change. The CLEAN Network is a professionally diverse community of over 640 members committed to improving climate and energy literacy locally, regionally, nationally, and globally, to enable responsible decisions and actions. The two main methods of engagement in the CLEAN Network are a email list and participation in the weekly teleconference highlighting important programs and initiatives. Other activities of the CLEAN Network include providing feedback on relevant national-scale documents, engagement through professional meetings, and outreach through postings on the CLEAN Facebook page and informational webinars. "},

These served as a record of weather in one place, but they were only rarely gathered or compared to understand regional conditions. In the early 1800s, an Army physician who wanted to understand how weather affected the health of the troops initiated a systematic effort to collect weather data. He had soldiers at army posts across the country observe and record their daily weather and send their records to a central location. This effort eventually resulted in more than twenty years of weather records for a large part of the United States. In 1891, the task of monitoring weather was transferred from the military to a civilian corps, creating the agency we now call the National Weather Service (NWS). As reliable, affordable weather instruments and methods for recording and storing data improved, people began to collect and share their weather records. Scientific organizations established standard instruments and procedures for weather-observing stations and develop systems to collect the information.  One example of weather data collected at Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Click the image for a larger view. Observers and automated stations record and submit raw data to NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) on a daily or monthly schedule. Meteorologists at NCEI use computers to perform a basic check of all incoming data. Computer programs check the patterns in each data record for any signs of malfunctioning equipment or systemic errors such as those shown below. The top left graph shows a common pattern of mid-morning temperatures measured every 5 minutes. The remaining panels show data patterns that may indicate a disturbance or a problem with the instruments. Data records that show these types of artifacts are flagged and excluded from further processing when calculating climate. Weather data are also checked for consistency across a region. Scientists check data sets from comparable stations to see if the data makes sense for the region and time of year. For example: does one station report sunshine and warm temperatures while a neighboring station shows sub-zero temperatures and clouds? If they find inconsistencies, meteorologists methodically track down the source of the inconsistent data. At this point, original data values may be flagged as incorrect, and excluded from further processing, but they are never changed or edited, unless the error was due to incorrect transcriptions by volunteers. Once weather data has passed quality control, it becomes part of the larger data record. The data can then be processed to generate climate products such as maps and graphs. Over time, records of weather observations help us understand the long-term conditions at each location. Animation showing maximum daily temperature (\"afternoon highs\") at Washington National Airport for 1 year, 3 years, and 30 years. In the frame showing 30 years of data, the scattering of individual dots (weather) becomes a broad swath that marks the long-term range of maximum temperatures (climate). Animation by NOAA Climate.gov.   (zip folder). Climate scientists quantify long-term average conditions for each date of the year by calculating the average (mean) of observed temperature, precipitation, humidity, and others. At the beginning of every new decade, NOAA scientists calculate official   for the previous three decades. These average values are the “normal” against which we compare our daily weather. Climate Normals help us answer the question: “How does today's weather compare to average conditions over the previous three decades?”  The most common processing steps used to turn daily weather data into climate data products involve straightforward mathematics. Operations such as adding and averaging turn weather data into climate information. For instance, a station's daily average (mean) temperature is calculated by averaging the minimum and maximum temperatures for the day: daily average = (minimum + maximum) / 2. As another example, a station's average monthly maximum temperature is calculated by averaging all the daily maximum temperatures observed during the month. For precipitation data, the most common processing step is adding: for instance, monthly precipitation values are calculated by adding the depths of precipitation from each day over the entire month. The purple line connects annual average temperatures observed at Blue Hill, Massachusetts from 1885 to 2018. Each annual average was calculated from a full year of daily averages of minimum and maximum temperatures. For comparison, the horizontal black line shows the overall average temperature at the station from 1901 to 2000. Image source:  , NOAA. To understand climate on larger scales, climatologists average data from individual stations with data from other stations in the area. When combining observations, the values for each station are mathematically weighted to account for the fraction of the averaging area they represent. This keeps areas with many weather stations from being overrepresented compared to areas with fewer stations. Climate products produced from databases of observations include reports, maps, and graphics such as monthly  . These data also serve as input for computer models to help generate future climate outlooks and weather forecasts. Current weather and climate data are used in many ways. People who make decisions for cities and towns rely on accurate and easy-to-understand graphs and maps to assist them in planning for energy needs, water management, and extreme weather events. Local climate data are also used to determine city budgets for maintaining roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. Climate data are used by people across many sectors of our economy. For example, farmers use climate data to select which crops to grow, while water managers use climate data to know when to release water from reservoirs.  . Following consistent procedures at every step—from making weather observations to publishing climate products—ensures that NOAA’s climate information is accurate and reliable.

Photo by Andrea Poe,  When several grand sugar maples at the famous Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania succumbed to disease recently, grounds manager Shawn Kister wondered if warm winters were to blame. Some plant diseases are stopped by cold, he knew, and others are encouraged by longer warm periods. Sugar maples like the cold, and Longwood is already at the southern edge of their historical range. A few hundred miles south, Charlotte-based TV meteorologist John Ahrens noticed that area rainfall had remained lower than normal for several years. The farmers and landscapers around Charlotte were compensating with more irrigation, but those systems are expensive. What was going on? Was this going to be the new normal? Gardeners, meteorologists, businesses, weather junkies and others will get answers to some of these questions in July, when NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) releases the latest version of an official weather product called the U.S. Climate Normals. Updated each decade, the U.S. Climate Normals are 30-year averages of many pieces of weather information collected from thousands of weather stations nationwide. Each time they are updated, an old decade is dropped, and a new one added. Starting in July, when you hear that a day was hotter, or colder, or rainier than normal, that \"normal\" will be a little different from what it was in the past. Across much of the country, overnight low temperatures in January are as much as several degrees warmer in the 1981–2010 Normals than they were in the 1971-2000 version (left). Meanwhile, the average maximum temperatures in July are actually cooler across some parts of the country (right).  This time around, the 30-year window for the U.S. Climate Normals is 1981-2010: the decade 1971-1980 was dropped, and 2001-2010 was added. Since the '70s were an unusually cool decade, while 2001-2010 was the warmest ever recorded, it is not surprising that the average temperature rose for most locations. For the United States as a whole, it was not daytime highs (maximum temperatures) but overnight lows (minimum temperatures) that rose the most compared with the 1970s. Many areas of the country—parts of the Great Plains, the Mississippi Valley, and the Northeast—actually had cooler July maximum average temperatures in the 2001-2010 time period compared to 30 years earlier; summer picnics in Missouri may have been less sweltering. At night, though, except for the southeasternmost part of the country, minimum temperatures in January were warmer. When temperatures were averaged for the entire year, every state came out warmer overall. On a state-by-state basis, the annual average minimum (left) and maximum (right) temperatures across the United States are warmer in the 1981-2010 Climate Normals than in the 1971-2000 version.  The observations that go into the U.S. Climate Normals come from the National Weather Service's network of Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) stations, numbering in the thousands; a smaller network of \"first order\" stations maintained by professionals in the National Weather Service or Federal Aviation Administration, numbering in the hundreds; and more than one hundred NOAA Climate Reference Network stations established in the past decade. Rainfall data are collected from than 8,000 stations, while temperature comes from about 6,000 stations. Some of the data are collected and reported automatically by instruments, while most of the measurements are collected manually each day by volunteers. Once a decade, a team at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center calculates the U.S. Climate Normals from these millions of bits of raw data. The U.S. Climate Normals draw on precipitation measurements from several thousand stations located across the country. NOAA map by Ned Gardiner, based on data from the  . NOAA scientist Anthony Arguez is the U.S. Climate Normals project manager. \"Our job,\" he says, \"is to take the data values as collected by the National Weather Service, apply robust quality control and standardization to improve the fidelity in our products, and use sophisticated statistical techniques that result in high-quality normals of temperature, precipitation, snowfall, and derived quantities such as heating and cooling degree days.\" The chart shows a range of variables—temperature, precipitation, wind speed, snowfall, and more—that factor into U.S. climate normals. Based on feedback from user groups such as power companies, National Climatic Data Center scientists have added some new information into the U.S. Climate Normals product suite, such as hourly temperatures and month- or year-to-date precipitation. The data can be accessed by anyone who wants to use them, such as television stations, water managers, insurance and energy companies, meteorologists, or emergency planners. The general methods for calculating climate normals were established back in the 1930s by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and they are still followed by the United States and many nations all over the world. The consistency means that the U.S. Climate Normals are part of a reliable, long-term data record that can be used for studying natural climate patterns and climate change. The information also helps people understand what conditions they can expect wherever they may live. Longwood Garden's Shawn Kister is not the only public garden expert wondering about a shifting climate. \"Longer periods of warm weather affect plants in many ways,\" says Mac Franklin, the head gardener of the North Carolina Arboretum, who in April is already sporting a farmer's tan. \"It can mean less water in the soil,\" he explains, \"and then the rain we do get can't seep into the ground as easily. Longer warm periods can lengthen the pest season and allow for more generations of pests,\" such as aphids. Pests are also able to thrive and spread in forests and other natural landscapes at least in part because of warmer nights. Both the native   which has ravaged forests from Colorado to Alaska, and the introduced   which has been sucking the life out of hemlocks in the East, may be benefiting from warmer nights, especially in winter.  of standing dead trees—pine beetle damage—in a patch of forest in the mountains near Granby, Colorado. Warmer winters are allowing the destructive insect to thrive. The pine beetle has infested 1.5 million acres of lodgepole pine in Colorado.  With warmer nights, fire season is longer. Pollination patterns may be changing. A study sponsored by Longwood Gardens showed that flowering plants have been blooming an average of one day earlier each decade. Warmer nights and later onset of freezing days also means that plants can generally survive farther north than they used to. Changes in U.S. climate-related planting zones between the 1971-2000 Normals and the 1981-2010 Normals. Many places' coldest temperatures of the year grew warmer between the two periods, leading to a shift in plant hardiness zones. NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NCEI. Explore an  North Carolina Arboretum Director George Briggs offers this advice to gardeners facing a shifting climate: \"If they are climate-literate they can put risk management into their decision making, make their design specifications more conservative.\" \"Public gardens have to balance costs, benefits and risk,\" says Briggs. \"It's a more complex decision matrix with these shifts. Will gardens have to beef up their sewer systems to account for  ? How much irrigation to put in? Where once you needed just enough to establish the landscape, now there may be a continuing need for water, or maybe you put in more conservative plants that are more water-efficient.\" To help garden visitors make sense of all these changes, the American Public Gardens Association is creating a cell phone tour about climate. At Longwood Gardens, the tour will begin in the managed meadow close to a still-surviving grand old sugar maple. A surviving sugar maple overlooks a managed meadow at Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania. The tree is the first stop on a cell phone tour of the garden that explains the potential impacts of climate change on plants. \"There is telling evidence that climate change is affecting plant life around the world and here at Longwood,\" says Paul Redman, Longwood's Director. \"Sharing the important work of NOAA with our staff, guests, and community is integral to our mission and continues Longwood Gardens' commitment to environmental stewardship.\" As for the U.S. Climate Normals, the team at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville will continue to release additional products over the coming months. These will include agricultural normals such as Frost/Freeze Dates, and population-weighted normals such as Heating and Cooling Degree Days. In the meantime, new data are being collected every day, at thousands of stations nationwide, that will eventually become part of the 1991-2020 U.S. Climate Normals, due for release in another ten years.

These are the parts of the United States where weather history suggests you want to be if you're looking for the best chance of a white Christmas. This map shows the historic probability of there being at least 1 inch of snow on the ground at weather stations across the United States on December 25 based on the latest (1991-2020)   from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Using those station data, experts interpolated values for all locations in the Lower 48. (  means estimating values where you don’t have direct observations, using existing observations and physical relationships, such as the way temperature changes with altitude.) Darkest gray shows places where the probability is less than 10%. (Sorry West Coast, Gulf Coast, Deep South!) White shows probabilities greater than 90 percent. The 1991–2020 Climate Normals are the latest three-decade averages of several climatological measurements.

While the map shows the historical probability that at least 1 inch of snow will be observed on December 25, the actual conditions in any year may vary widely from these because the weather patterns present will determine the snow on the ground or snowfall on Christmas day. These probabilities are useful as a guide only to show where snow on the ground is more likely. For prediction of your actual weather on Christmas, check out your local forecast at  . Long-time readers of Climate.gov will know that this map is an update of   originally made by NCEI experts using data from the 1981-2010 U.S. Climate Normals. If you’re tempted to compare the two maps for signs of the influence of long-term warming, keep a few things in mind. First, comparing two adjacent Normals periods is not the most direct way to look for climate change. From one 30-year Normals period to the next, two decades of the data are the same; only one decade out of three is new. This gradual introduction of a single decade of new data means that most changes from one Normals period to the next will be relatively small compared to the trend between the oldest decade and the most recent decade. It also means that at some locations, changes could be the result of natural decadal variability. Second, there are plenty of places in the U.S. where the temperature in late December is frequently well below freezing. Monthly or annual average air temperatures in those areas could be warming over the long-term—and they are, for  —without causing a noticeable decline in the chance of snow on any given late December day at any given location. Snow cover on a specific day of a specific year is largely a product of day-to-day weather systems, rather than long term climate trends. All that said, however, the spatial fingerprints of climate change that we’d expect based on our modelling studies are visible in national patterns of . So, it’s not surprising that there are some subtle differences between the 1981-2010 version of the white Christmas map and the 1991-2020 version that are consistent with the reality of long-term warming. More areas experienced decreases in their chances of a white Christmas than experienced increases. The easiest one to spot with the naked eye is the expansion of the dark gray area, where the chances of a white Christmas are less than 10%. The gray area shifted noticeably northward across the South, and upslope along the ocean-facing slopes of some of the West Coast mountain ranges. Beyond those broad strokes, local changes between the two maps would have to be carefully investigated and placed into context with other climate data and analysis techniques better suited for detecting long-term change.

The lake is an ideal water supply—deep, cold, low in nutrients, and fed by mostly forested land in the Crooked River watershed. For as long as water from the lake meets strict quality standards, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has granted the Portland Water District a filtration avoidance waiver under the Safe Drinking Water Act, allowing it to avoid the cost of a built filtration plant. Old Port area of Portland, ME, with the White Mountains visible in the background. Photo Credit: Alex Boykov via  . In recent years, a confluence of several environmental changes has become a concern for the lake’s water quality. For example, the U.S. Forest Service determined that development pressure is putting some areas of the Sebago Lake watershed at high risk of forest conversion: coupled with unsustainable land use practices, conversion is a major threat to water quality. Upstream development, deforestation, and population growth in the area can all reduce water quality. And each factor is complicated by climate-related changes in precipitation and temperature patterns, including increased frequency of extreme precipitation events.

Community members were concerned that continuing changes could jeopardize the filtration waiver and force the Portland Water District to install a conventional filtration system—the level of concern reflected the estimated $100–150 million cost for the system. In response to the risk of incurring this expense, the community actively investigated alternatives that could minimize the chance of losing their filtration waiver or otherwise reduce their costs for water treatment.

To get a sense of economic trade-offs involved in the decision, and to identify data gaps and parameters that would need to be addressed for a more complete analysis, a collaborative group applied their expertise to complete the Green-Gray Analysis. The analysis compared the costs and benefits for two approaches to protect the water supply: natural (green) infrastructure and built (gray) infrastructure. Specifically, the method compared the cost of a new filtration plant with a 20-year investment in five forest-based, natural infrastructure elements that would help retain the existing high-quality waters of the Sebago Lake Watershed. The elements included riparian buffers, upgrades to culverts with a risk of failure in severe storm events, sustainability certification of future timber harvests, reforestation in riparian zones, and conservation easements. Given the uncertainty associated with the lack of underlying biophysical modeling, the method tested various scenarios under different assumptions regarding the efficacy of the natural infrastructure measures. The method also considered various cost estimates for initial and annual costs of the alternative investment portfolios. In the expected or baseline scenario, findings indicated the natural infrastructure option could realize savings of $12 million over 20 years—a result that didn't include the potential public benefits from increased carbon sequestration and enhanced Atlantic salmon habitat. Under an optimistic scenario, the natural infrastructure option would generate savings of up to $110 million. Preliminary results of the Green-Gray Analysis for two scenarios for Portland, Maine, indicated potential savings of $12 to $111 million by investing in green infrastructure rather than a membrane filtration system. NOAA Climate.gov graph via the  . Under the least optimistic scenario—which assumes lower-bound cost estimates for the membrane filtration system, high use of costly conservation easements, and residual risk of waiver loss of 25 percent—the natural infrastructure option would represent a cost increase of up to 46 percent. Even with these pessimistic assumptions, results indicated the natural option would be economically superior when considering the full range of ancillary benefits. Based on a combination of empirical data on the ground and calibrated non-market benefits transferred from other settings, non-market benefits from carbon sequestration and enhanced Atlantic salmon habitat alone were estimated at $72 to $125 million over a 20-year time frame.

In 2013, based on the results of the assessment, the Portland Water District made the decision to invest in natural infrastructure to secure clean water in Sebago Lake. In order to accelerate land protection in the region, the utility pays up to 25 percent of the costs of conservation easement purchases. In 2014, execution of this policy amounted to $26,000, the utility’s largest conservation investment to date. The Green-Gray Analysis enabled decision makers at Portland Water District to compare projected financial and ecological costs for water treatment. As a result of the analysis, the utility integrated natural infrastructure into their water resource management efforts in ways that enhance their resilience to climate change, keep costs down, and provide co-benefits for communities and the environment. In recognizing that an integrated approach to securing clean drinking water and other watershed services is cost-effective and made sense ecologically, the Portland Water District made strides toward ensuring resiliency, sustainability, and water security for the region.

Building on lessons learned over several summers, Kristin Raab—Health Impact Assessment and Climate Change Program Director in the Environmental Health Division of Minnesota’s Department of Health—packaged information from diverse communities into a cohesive toolkit that communities of all sizes can use to prepare for heat waves. The   describes changing weather conditions in Minnesota, the magnitude of potential health consequences from extreme heat, and key steps communities can take to prevent heat-related illnesses and deaths. Decision makers can identify where to focus their resilience-building efforts by identifying where relatively high numbers of vulnerable people live.This map shows the percentage of the population below the poverty line by county.

The toolkit acknowledges that extreme heat response plans will vary with the size of the community and the habits of its residents: examples from the mostly rural Olmsted County and the urban centers of Saint Paul and Minneapolis illustrate a range of community plans that could be useful in Minnesota and beyond. Olmsted County in southeastern Minnesota is home to a generally healthy, largely rural population. After a resident died during an excessive heat event in the early 2000s, though, Olmsted County’s Public Health Services reconsidered their emergency management plan and included provisions for extreme heat events. In 2010, for instance, the county offered access to centralized cooling centers during extremely hot days, but they found that residents did not take advantage of them. Planners went back to the drawing board to find simpler solutions to keep people cool. Today, when the NOAA National Weather Service issues an advisory or warning for an excessive heat event, public service announcements on radio and television stations in the county suggest that people who don’t have air conditioning head to cool locations—such as libraries, shopping centers, or senior centers. Additionally, the Mayor of Rochester, the county seat, may use discretion to offer free bus rides to those locations. As some people do not tune in to media, the county’s Health Services staff also distributes flyers through non-governmental organizations such as Meals on Wheels. Amy Evans, the County Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, and her team review their strategies each year and consider new ideas to protect residents. Saint Paul, Minnesota skyline.

Robert Einweck, the Health Protection Division Manager for Ramsey County, recognizes that this age group has fewer metabolic defenses from the ill effects of heat than the general population. He relies on both public officials and community partners to help protect older populations. The county pushes automated email messages to many of its service providers, encouraging them to contact vulnerable clients during heat events and get them to cool locations.  This map shows the percentage of the population 65 years or older by county.

To protect the full range of residents in the county, the Health Protection Division also provides maps highlighting locations where people can access air conditioning. They show public facilities such as libraries, as well as privately owned settings such as shopping malls and cinemas. And when heat waves occur, the Mayor’s office often authorizes extended hours for pools and recreation centers. Einweck and colleagues also developed a translation system, called ECHO, that provides emergency warnings in Spanish, Hmong, and Somali so that language isn’t an obstacle to effective outreach and communication. Pam Blixt, Emergency Preparedness Manager in the neighboring, larger “twin city” of Minneapolis, was a co-creator of ECHO. Blixt is working with her department’s staff meteorologist to shift their warning system from simple measures of heat to a measurement that incorporates humidity and, therefore, the intensity of heat exposure. Her suggestion is to monitor “wet bulb” temperature, the same measure the U.S. military monitors while conducting military exercises. To support this improvement, Hennepin County has deployed a network of sensors to supplement official NOAA weather stations so that higher-resolution measures of temperature and humidity are available in real time. Hennepin County's   highlights locations where residents can go to cool down. Libraries, community centers, and shopping malls are shown on the map. Blixt’s department also developed a mobile app that encapsulates many of the strategies that smaller communities use, including maps of cool places people can go during heat waves. Their notification network includes over 500 agencies and organizations that deliver services throughout the community. Broadcast meteorologists in Minneapolis also help spread educational information before and during heat waves. Additionally, the city’s extreme heat website provides information, such as a list of medications that may increase the effects of extreme heat, descriptions that can help people recognize the signs of heat sickness, and emergency contact numbers. One conclusion from government agencies of all sizes is that good communication with NOAA’s forecast offices is an essential first step to preparing for extreme heat events. The National Weather Service is the key source of information that catalyzes a cascade of varying responses, and those responses vary depending on the size of the community where they are implemented. The Minnesota Department of Health’s Extreme Heat Toolkit includes adaptation examples and a draft response plan to help health officials and emergency managers beat the heat.

Morgan Stewart, The Day, courtesy of Peg Van Patten. In 2015, in response to climate change projections, the town began working with staff from the Environmental Protection Agency's Region 1 to assess infrastructure for their water supply. Of particular concern was the potential for contamination of drinking water from saltwater intrusion and sea level rise. Town officials also considered the potential for more severe weather and flooding, which could carry waste and hazardous materials into the water supply. The team mapped the locations of critical infrastructure, and then overlaid maps showing which parts of town flooded, and how deeply, during previous hurricanes. Using a   developed by NOAA, the project also evaluated how projected sea level rise due to global warming would increase the extent and depth of flooding during a Category 2 or Category 4 hurricane. The mapping efforts inspired the idea for a disaster-preparedness initiative. Town leaders gathered a coalition of community members from across sectors and generations. This team—dubbed Weather Ready Mattapoisett—included local Boy Scouts, the city librarian, the television station, educators, the Council on Aging, and the town mascot Salty the Seahorse. Together, they developed a message and came up with ways to get it out to the community in a cohesive and recognizable campaign. Gathering information and testimonies from survivors of the previous storms was a major part of the project. Organizers issued a call for videos, stories, and pictures from past extreme events. The library collected and digitized the information, and then shared it with Old Rochester Cable TV, the local cable television station. About a dozen residents provided more than 120 items. Survivors’ interviews were recorded and edited into short stories and shared on the project’s local website. Photos of flooding from past storms were displayed alongside current images of the town in “Mattapoisett Then and Now,” an exhibit that remains in the library. One local Boy Scout contributed to the effort as part of his Eagle Scout Project, creating the Flood Marker Trail. Signs and bands fixed to utility poles throughout the city mark the extent of the past floods.

The town manager describes the project and survivor’s stories as shocking to visitors. These activities help reveal how damaging a severe hurricane can be to those who have never experienced one, and encourage residents and visitors to take emergency preparedness seriously. The campaign doesn't stop with raising awareness of how to stay safe during a storm—it also addresses issues that can affect community members’ safety after the event. The release of hazardous materials into the drinking water supply, the backup of wastewater into homes, and heightened risk of explosion from damage to fuel tanks are some potential post-storm hazards. To help residents understand the range of potential issues related to strong storms, the town produced a  .

The town also hosted a community “Prepare-A-Thon,” where participants were able to get this information in greater detail and learn more about the work of the Weather Ready Mattapoisett team. The project began sharing their messages with the public in 2016, and the combined efforts of private and public partners appears to be paying off. The group acted definitively, using their past experiences to better prepare for their future. By educating themselves on past storms and preparing for future storms, the community is more resilient. Weather Ready Mattapoisett helped the community set itself up to prevent water contamination, release of toxic chemicals, and loss of human life in the face of future storms.

The West is particularly vulnerable to such fires. Between 1970 and 2003, warmer and drier conditions increased burned area in western U.S. mid-elevation conifer forests by 650 percent. As noted in the 2014 National Climate Assessment, from 1916 to 2003 climate outweighed other factors in determining burned area in the western United States. The projected increase in the number of “very large fire\" weeks—weeks in which conditions are favorable to the occurrence of very large fires—by mid-century (2041-2070) compared to the recent past (1971-2000). Projections are based on the possible emissions scenario known  , which assumes continued increases in carbon dioxide emissions. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from Barbera  , 2015.  Experts project that wildfires will become even more frequent as climate change continues; projections include a doubling of burned area in the southern Rockies, and up to 74 percent more fires in  . Such wildfires pose significant dangers to hospitals’ abilities to serve their communities. As wildfires encroach, hospitals can be forced to evacuate, even if the fire itself is not near the building. Hospital ventilation systems require a fresh supply of outdoor air to maintain indoor air quality and pressurization; if outdoor air is contaminated by heavy smoke, it may be impossible to safely house patients and staff in the building. A large plume of smoke is seen rising from the North Fork fire in Jefferson County, CO, in 2012. Photo courtesy  . During wildfires, however, hospital emergency departments near the fire must remain operational to treat firefighters and affected community residents. To deal with smoke risks, hospitals in fire-prone areas can isolate emergency department ventilation systems and enable recirculated air during emergency conditions. In addition, portable air scrubbers or HEPA (high-efficiency particulate arresting) filters can be placed in various units to capture smoke, fumes, and airborne particles if outdoor ventilation systems must be shut down. In 2008, southern California experienced two major wildfires: the Sesnon Fire in October lasted five days and the Sayre fire in November lasted six days. The Sesnon blaze posed a major threat to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center by engulfing the facility in smoke. Later, the Sayre fire was more intense, crossing a highway and preventing 40 percent of Providence’s staff from reaching the facility. Driven by powerful Santa Ana winds, this NASA satellite image from October 13, 2008, shows smoke from the wildfires that raged near Los Angeles. Image courtesy  . As it is the only local area trauma center in Burbank, Providence received more than 200 patients from neighboring hospitals and had to cancel all elective surgeries. Providence was able to stay open and operational through both fires, thanks in large part to its use of HEPA filters. The medical center had purchased these filters earlier for pandemic flu preparedness. The filters purify the air in a way that facilitates the central ventilation system maintaining zero pressures (critical for quarantine rooms). In this case, however, using the equipment for a different purpose enabled the hospital to remain open and functional during a fire event.

Darin Overstreet.  In June 2013, the Black Forest fire in Colorado forced the evacuation or pre-evacuation of approximately 300 employees of Memorial Hospital and Children’s Hospital Colorado from their homes. When Memorial Hospital received reports of the encroaching fire, the administrators immediately began preparing based on the hospital’s previous experience with the Waldo Canyon fire in 2012. Memorial’s Safety and Facilities departments began “environmental rounds,” monitoring air quality in the buildings. The team placed portable air scrubbers at Memorial Hospital North, which was nearly full with patients, and at Memorial Hospital Central.

From 2009 to 2011 alone, three major floods caused more than $1 billion dollars in damage, impacting the lives and livelihoods of people across the region. An area of Fargo, ND, is flooded by the Red River of the North in March 2009. Public Domain Photo Courtesy Patsy Lynch, FEMA. As climate scientists project the frequency and intensity of flooding events to increase in many areas due to climate change, homeowners, businesses, and municipalities across the Red River Valley are eager for tools and information that can help them avoid damage and recover more quickly when flooding does occur. Riverine flood forecasts from the National Weather Service’s North Central River Forecast Center (NCRFC) provide solid information for flood emergency planning efforts. For instance, emergency managers can view graphs showing estimated height and timing of high water at various points along a river. Though these officials understand how to convert cubic feet per second (cfs) of Tailwater, Pool, or In-flow Discharge on flood forecast graphs into maps showing areas that may be affected by flooding, the full range of folks who might be impacted by the event can't tell by looking at the graphs if they should expect flooding. In response to the high frequency of flooding impacts, leaders in the region created the   (RRBDIN).  A screenshot of the RRBDIN’s Flood Forecast Display Tool. This network facilitates collaboration among various entities, enabling them to develop and offer tools that can improve resiliency to flooding. One such collaboration is a public-private, nonprofit partnership among the North Central River Forecast Center (NCRFC), the International Water Institute, and Houston Engineering Inc. Members of this group gathered a range of specific data to help residents prepare for flooding, and then packaged it into a web-based visualization tool called the Flood Forecast Display Tool (FFDT). In 2009, Dave DeMuth, a resident of Moorhead, Minnesota, consulted the FFDT’s interactive map to display visualizations of the flood forecast generated by the NCRFC. He examined an inundation map, an inundation depth grid, and graphics depicting the estimated arrival time of the flood’s peak as well as flow conditions in and around the region for the flood forecast period. Using information from the tool, he was able to estimate peak crest height, timing, and the sandbag count needed to protect resources in advance of the flood. A line of volunteers moves sandbags to construct a dike in Fargo, ND, in March 2009. Photo Courtesy Adam Quartarolo, used via CC license. Armed with this information, DeMuth interacted with homeowners who were forecast to be impacted and discussed strategies for fighting the flood. The FFDT helped him estimate the amount of time, number of people, and funds it would take to fill the number of sandbags needed to protect various assets. This vital information helped many residents protect their homes and businesses in 2009 and again in 2010. Private residents, emergency responders, agricultural producers, and small businesses can also use the FFDT to get a sense of how they may be impacted before flooding occurs. For example, agricultural producers in the Red River Valley can access the tool during spring runoff events to visualize if and when their lands are likely to be inundated by floodwaters. This information empowers them to choose and implement adaptive strategies that increase the resiliency of their operations. Private residents can search for their address and access visualizations that show the extent of inundation expected in their neighborhoods. They can also use the Sandbag Calculator to estimate the number of sandbags they will need to protect homes and businesses. Sandbags block off flooding.

The FFDT continues to provide valuable information to people in the Red River Valley during flooding, and serves as a successful example of a public-private partnership that applies emerging web-based technologies to encourage resilient responses to flooding. Additionally, the partnership plans to continue improving the tool: by incorporating NCRFC ensemble stream forecasts, they plan to offer probabilities that an area will be inundated, similar to the format weather forecasters use when predicting chances for rain or snow.

On February 11, DSCOVR began its million-mile journey to Lagrange point 1 (or L1 orbit), an orbital sweet spot between Earth and the Sun. There, gravitational forces between the Sun and Earth are perfectly balanced, and the satellite will orbit the Sun like a planet. Lagrange point 1 (L1) is a neutral gravity point between Earth and the Sun, situated roughly 1 million miles from Earth. Most Earth-observing satellites orbit within 22,300 miles of the planet. Credit:  .  The satellite's primary mission is monitoring space weather, but it is also carrying a critical climate-science instrument: a radiation monitor that will measure the amount of energy reflected from and radiated by Earth. The new device, nicknamed NISTAR, will give scientists the most exact measurements they've ever had of the amount of energy being trapped in Earth's atmosphere by greenhouse gases. An artist’s rendering of the DSCOVR satellite.  Credit:  . At the most basic level, Earth’s temperature is determined by its energy balance: how much solar energy (total solar irradiance) is received at the top of Earth's atmosphere, minus the amount the atmosphere and surface reflect and radiate back into space as heat (outgoing longwave radiation). The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the slower the heat escapes, and the more Earth’s surface warms. The uneven distribution of land, ocean, and sea ice on our planet’s surface—not to mention continuously changing cloud cover—make estimating the exact amount of radiant energy emitted and reflected by our planet very difficult. Satellites have been measuring Earth’s energy budget since the NIMBUS missions of the mid-1970s. However, stitching a complete time series together from the collection of sensors that observe different parts of Earth from different angles at different times of day has been challenging. NISTAR (short for National Institute of Standards & Technology Advanced Radiometer) will change all that. The data collected by NISTAR, measured from the vantage point of the L1 orbit, will provide measurements from the whole sunlit face of Earth at once.   “The NISTAR radiometer will measure the reflected and radiated energy from Earth in the important direction back towards the Sun. We have other satellites that measure these quantities at other directions. [But those satellites] have to orbit around Earth, spending only a portion of their orbits in the light,” said Adam Szabo, DSCOVR Project Scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. “The advantage of NISTAR is that it observes the whole sunlit face of Earth. Thus we do not have to worry about intercalibrations between different measurements from different platforms.” NISTAR is a cavity radiometer. As it sits between Earth and the Sun, it works by absorbing any electromagnetic radiation that falls within its aperture. This energy heats up the cavity and raises the machine’s internal temperature. When the cavity heats up, the device’s onboard heaters don’t have to work as hard to maintain a constant internal temperature. Scientists can infer the amount of energy reflected and radiated by Earth by measuring variations in the amount of electricity the heaters draw.  TOP: DSCOVR Mission's NIST Advanced Radiometer. BOTTOM: Location of NISTAR on the DSCOVR satellite (in orange). Photo Courtesy: NASA. Climate scientists have two main ways of estimating Earth’s energy budget. One is the direct observations of incoming and outgoing energy captured by satellites over the past three decades. The other way is to infer how much heat energy must have been trapped in the Earth's system to maintain the oceans at their currently observed temperature. Currently, however, there is a 6.5 w/m  difference between the estimates derived from direct observations and the estimates that ocean temperature measurements suggest.  “Our hope is that using a single well-calibrated instrument to measure the most critical contribution of reflected light [light reflected back towards the sun] will reduce this difference,” said Szabo. Of the 340 watts per square meter of solar energy that falls on the sunlit side of Earth, 29 percent is reflected back into space, primarily by clouds, but also by other bright surfaces and the atmosphere itself. About 23 percent of incoming energy is absorbed by atmospheric gases, dust, and other particles in the atmosphere. The remaining 48 percent is absorbed at the surface. Courtesy  . Although extremely important in understanding climate, the amount of data NISTAR transmits is small. It can easily fit within the real-time space weather reporting, so there’s no need for extra transmissions to get the NISTAR data to Earth. The radiometer’s raw measurements will be available five minutes after observation. “However, to properly calibrate this data and incorporate it into [the existing] radiation budget model will take several months at the beginning, and weeks as we become proficient at it,” said Szabo. Joining DSCOVR on its million-mile journey from home is the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC), which will capture the full face of Earth in a single image, something previously done only by the Apollo 17 astronauts and the Galileo mission on its way to Jupiter. Satellites in closer orbits get only a fraction of this view, so scientists have to piece images together to get the whole picture. This 2011 image was the first global image from the VIIRS radiometer on the NPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite. It was pieced together using data from sequential passes of the satellite. Credit:  . “Low-Earth orbiting satellites see only a small patch of the ground at a time and full Earth images are stitched together from 24- or 48-hour observations. Sitting at L1, DSCOVR will see the full sunlit face of Earth at once and will provide such images roughly every two hours,” said Szabo. More than just pretty pictures, these images will provide valuable atmospheric data. Combining images from different wavelengths will let scientists measure ozone, aerosol, vegetation cover, dust and volcanic ash, cloud height, and UV radiation estimates at Earth’s surface. “We will be able to follow daily variations,” said Szabo. The interaction between clouds and aerosols is also a climate issue, since aerosols can change cloud thickness, droplet size, and lifetimes. All these factors affect incoming and outgoing sunlight, which influences the energy balance and therefore, climate. A simulated view of what pictures from DSCOVR will look like during the new moon phase each month. The image of Earth is a composite of data from different NASA satellites. The moon is in the foreground.   generated by Karin Blank at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. EPIC will provide images of the entire sunlit face of our planet at 10 different wavelengths (called channels), from ultraviolet to near infrared. The narrowband filter for each channel can isolate just one particular wavelength while blocking all other sources of light. “Earth does not reflect all wavelengths of light equally. Various gases and particles in our atmosphere are excited by very specific wavelengths of light, absorbing only those photons. Our eye cannot detect these very narrow missing colors,” said Szabo. “For example: one wavelength channel on EPIC corresponds to O  (ozone) absorption. Differencing the image from this wavelength with a wavelength that’s not sensitive to O  gives scientists a global map of ozone. Scientists can repeat this same process for reflection of light from the Earth’s surface and atmosphere: green leaf photosynthesis to get a vegetation index, and with SO  to follow volcanic eruptions.” DSCOVR started transmitting solar wind data a week after launch, but Szabo says this is for calibration purposes only. “The spacecraft will still be too close to Earth to provide space weather warnings,” he said. The same is true for NISTAR: its data won't be usable until DSCOVR has a full view of Earth, but scientists have already switched the instrument on to begin testing its electronics. The EPIC camera won’t be turned on until the satellite reaches L1 orbit at 115 days. You can expect DSCOVR's first pictures of Earth to appear on the Web sometime in late July or early August. .

Almost 100 years later, the Nenana River Ice Classic competition continues, and participants closely observing the local climate might have an edge. The official Nenana Ice Classic tripod.   taken on March 24, 2009, by Flickr user James Brooks,  . Located in the interior of Alaska on the bank of the Tanana River, just upriver from its confluence with the Nenana River, the town of Nenana is home to less than 400 people, according to the 2010 Census. The Tanana River usually begins to freeze in October or November. In early March, a tripod is planted 300 feet from shore in about two feet of river ice, as seen in the photo above. It is connected to an on-shore clock that stops when the ice gives out and the tripod tumbles into the water. The history of the annual plunge of the Tanana River tripod provides a record of interior Alaska’s spring climate since the time of World War I. According to that record, kept by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, ice on the Tanana River generally can break up anywhere from April 20 to May 20. The ice went out last year at 3:48 p.m. on April 25, but the ice is currently thinner than it was at this time last year. As of April 6, the ice measured 33.5 Inches. On April 7 a year ago, the ice measured 36.8 inches. For a competition so closely tied to the climate, it makes sense to get a local expert’s analysis. Rick Thoman, Climate Sciences and Services Manager for the National Weather Service’s Alaska Region, says by far the most important factor for the timing of ice break-up are spring temperatures, especially the timing of warm or cold spells. Secondary factors include winter snowfall (which dictates water levels in the river), winter temperatures, and ice thickness. “Break-up of the Tanana River at Nenana takes place in two basically two different ways,” Thoman says. “One, referred to in Alaska as a ‘mush-out,’ occurs when the ice gradually rots in place and the water flowing in the river gradually increases as snow upstream melts and runs off. This typically happens when daily temperatures are well above freezing during the day and then it freezes hard at night. “The other way occurs when the volume of water flowing in the river rapidly increases, and the ice is lifted and mechanically broken up. This typically happens when there is a dramatic warm-up in mid- to late-April or early May, and is more likely with deeper snowpacks.” This year, Alaska’s full cold season—from October (when the ice starts forming) through March—was the third warmest on record since the winter of 1925-26. But in the Southeast Interior where Nenana and most of the Tanana River drainage is located, it was a little cooler overall, ranking as the 11th warmest cold season on record. But it was warmer than that same period last year, which came in as the 15th warmest. Although it may seem counter-intuitive, low snow winters generally produce thicker ice cover. Snow acts like an insulating blanket over ice, protecting it from changes in the air temperature aloft. If this insulating effect is reduced, the ice can grow thicker. “Typically, low-snow autumns can result in thick ice, Thoman says. “Even in a low-snow winter, there would typically be a foot or more of snow on the ice by New Year’s.” Another way of looking at the Tanana River ice break up. Data data from 1917-2014 divided into three categories: later than average (green), near-average (gray), and earlier than average (pink). Notice how earlier-than-average break up dates (pink dots) dominate recent decades. The black trend line also shows that the break-up date is getting earlier. NOAA Climate.gov graph courtesy of   from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Apart from providing a fun challenge each spring, Thoman says the Nenana Ice Classic provides a useful, “non-instrumental” record of long-term changes in spring temperatures and the earlier ice-break ups in Interior Alaska over the past century. “The ice break-up record at Nenana is unique in the consistency of how the data has been gathered,” Thoman explains. “There is no reason I’m aware of to ascribe the earlier break-ups to purely local changes.” He cites the fact that Nenana has always had a population of 200-700 people, and remains mostly untouched by the urban impacts of Fairbanks about 60 miles upriver. The Tenana also runs in a single channel at this location, unlike other reaches of the river with multiple channels, where the amount of water running in any particular channel fluctuates greatly. He also points to ice break-up dates that have been collected for the Yukon River at Dawson City, Canada, since the late 1890s. While their measurements have not been gathered using the consistent method used in Nenana, the data shows exactly the same pattern: little trend until the 1970s, and then a steady decrease. These trends in river ice break-up are one more indicator of the impacts of climate change in Alaska. National Snow and Ice Data Center. 1998.  . Boulder, CO: National Snow and Ice Data Center.

But say “flask” to atmospheric chemist Steve Montzka, and he sees something more like a fire extinguisher or a stainless steel, two-liter soda bottle.  Analytical chemist Stephen Montzka in the lab in Boulder, Colorado, where flasks of air (such as those behind him on the desk) are tested for chemicals that replaced ozone-harming CFCs.

Filled with air samples from all over the world, the flasks arrive week in and week out at Montzka’s lab in Boulder, Colorado, where he leads NOAA’s effort to monitor the atmospheric concentration of the chemicals that, thanks to the Montreal Protocol, are replacing the CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) that harm Earth’s ozone layer. His flasks may be full of air, but like a cowboy with a flask of whiskey, Montzka has stories: about the success of the Montreal Protocol, what he’s learned about how the atmosphere rids itself of pollutants, and most recently, how big an influence the CFC replacements—which are also greenhouse gases— . When Montzka arrived at the Global Monitoring Division of NOAA’s Earth Sciences Research Lab in Boulder in 1991, the group had already been measuring ozone-depleting chemicals since the late 1970s. Flasks came in from all over the world—from fixed observatories, from ship cruises, from airplanes. Flasks are shipped to and from the Boulder lab in foam-lined suitcases. Samples come in from all over the world. The stack at left includes flasks from Ireland, Alaska, Hawaii, American Samoa, California, and Canada.

The standard approach for measuring ozone-depleting chemicals is something called an electron capture detector. “This electron capture detector is  Montzka says, with the kind of admiration that others tend to reserve for their latest smartphone. “It is one of the most sensitive detectors that exists in analytical chemistry.” The process starts with an obstacle course. Air samples are pushed through a narrow metal column by highly pressurized nitrogen gas. The column is packed with sticky resin beads that gas molecules have to squeeze past. The pace at which they emerge from the column depends on how tightly the different molecules stick to the resin.   The obstacle course—its real name is  —uses nitrogen to flush the samples through because nitrogen ionizes (gives up electrons) easily. As the gases emerge, they are exposed to a small amount of radioactive nickel, which emits just enough energy to ionize the nitrogen gas that’s present. Among the tangle of wires running out of the container for an Electron Capture Detector is an overheating protection device: the detectors are maintained at extremely high temperatures, and a melt down would ruin the detector. Photo by David Oonk. The electrons bumped off the nitrogen produce an electric current in the detection chamber, a sort of background hum. The “hum” can be silenced by CFCs and similar ozone-destroying substances, which contain halogens—a group of hyper-reactive elements that includes fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. That reactivity is what makes CFCs so harmful to the ozone layer. In the ionization chamber, they quickly capture the electrons from the ionized nitrogen. The background current drops, and the amount it drops is proportional to the amount of the ozone-depleting gas in the air sample. Developed by James Lovelock—of   fame—the device is incredibly sensitive to ozone-depleting chemicals. “But,” says Montzka, “it turns out the electron capture detector is only good for fully halogenated carbon gases. The substitutes for the ozone-depleting gases were   fully halogenated, of course,” because the point was to   the things that damaged the ozone layer. In addition, Montzka points out, at that time, “The replacement chemicals had only been in use for a few years, and their concentration in some cases was as low as 1 part per trillion, compared to a couple   parts per trillion for the ozone-depleting chemicals.” To measure the CFC replacements, Montzka says, “NOAA needed something different,” which is how he ended up at the lab.   The Montreal Protocol eliminated ozone-depleting pollutants in phases. First-generation substitutes were still harmful, but much less so. By 2013, all countries were expected to have begun their transition to ozone-safe safe, second-generation substitutes. Montzka’s job when he started at NOAA was to re-configure the lab’s existing devices to measure the substitutes.   Liquid nitrogen helps chill and condense individual gases from the flask sample. Lenses steer ion fragments toward the quadrupole: an electrified conduit with an oscillating voltage. The quadrupole is continuously tuned to allow ions of only one mass-to-charge ratio through to the detector at a time. A vacuum pump keeps oxygen from incinerating the rhenium filament. Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. The first thing he did was build a condenser upstream of the gas chromatography column. The condenser is a temperature-controlled warren of tubes, valves, and chambers that can be chilled to condense and isolate a desired gas or emptied with a vacuum pump to remove unwanted ones (like oxygen or nitrogen).  To make the system even better at purifying gases, he made the gas chromatograph’s obstacle course even tougher. He swapped out the relatively short column in the existing device with a 200-foot-long, coiled glass fiber. Its internal diameter is barely bigger than a human hair, and it is coated with a thin sheen of oil. Gas molecules dissolve into and out of the oil at different rates, which determines how quickly they emerge out the end of the tube. The gas chromatography oven. Gases flow through a 200-foot glass coil with an internal diameter just bigger than a human hair. Photo by David Oonk. In the ionization chamber, he replaced the radioactive nickel with an even more powerful ionizer: a red-hot filament made out of rhenium, one of the rarest metals on Earth. The filament emits a beam of high-energy electrons that is powerful enough to directly ionize the CFC-replacement gases themselves. When a gas emerges from the coil, the electron beam shatters it into a cloud of ion fragments. Each fragment has a unique ratio of mass to electric charge, a signature as individual as a fingerprint. Each   of ion fragments is unique, as well. “Every different chemical produces a unique spectrum of fragment ions, and that spectrum can be used to identify the chemical,” Montzka explains.  An ion’s-eye view of the quadrupole—an electrified conduit that funnels ions to a detector.   A chromatogram (top) is a picture of the electric current generated by different types of ion fragments striking the detector at different times. A mass spectrum (bottom) shows signal intensity for all the ions being generated at a particular point in the chromatogram.

A mass spec’s computer includes a library of the spectra of thousands of chemicals, from performance-enhancing drugs to black widow venom to HFC-134a—the ozone-safe refrigerant used in vehicle air conditioners today. Chemicals in a sample can be identified by matching the spectrum they produce to the spectra in the library. Montzka adds, “And if you focus on the amount of any one   ion associated with a specific chemical, you can use the signal to say how much of the original chemical was in the sample.” (1) Flask hookup area.

Once Montzka retrofitted and thoroughly tested the new device, NOAA’s lab was able to process flasks not only for ozone-depleting gases but also their substitutes. The new results gave scientists and decision makers evidence of how international efforts to protect the ozone layer were progressing. In the decades since he started NOAA’s CFC-alternative monitoring project, Montzka’s had the satisfaction of seeing the levels of ozone-damaging chemicals drop and the size of the annual Antarctic ozone hole stabilize. If current trends continue, the ozone layer should recover to its 1980 condition in about 55 years. That good news doesn’t mean that our challenges with ozone-depleting chemicals and their replacements are over, however.  Today’s dilemma is whether the Montreal Protocol should be amended to restrict some of the current second-generation replacements because of their potential contribution to global warming. The original CFCs were powerful greenhouse gases, and reducing them made a small but meaningful contribution to slowing global warming. Some of the second-generation CFC alternatives are potent greenhouse gases that persist for 20-30 years. In the late 2000s, some scientists predicted that unrestricted use of these long-lived substitutes through 2050 would wipe out all the climate benefits that the Montreal Protocol had achieved. Global emissions (solid lines) and atmospheric concentrations (dashed lines) of CFC-12 (blue)—a refrigerant used in vehicle air conditioning systems—and its ozone-safe replacement, HFC-134a (orange). Emissions of CFC-12 dropped sharply after the Montreal Protocol agreement in 1987, but concentrations remain high because, like most CFCs, it doesn’t break down in the atmosphere for decades. NOAA Climate.gov graph adapted from original provided by Steve Montzka. “The Montreal Protocol community saw that as a call to say, ‘Maybe we need to consider these substitutes more carefully in terms of climate,” says Montzka. It’s a debate that has been going on at virtually every Montreal Protocol meeting for at least 6 years, according to Montzka, including a recent one in Paris in November 2014, which he attended. He was at the meeting to present the community with  on how closely concentrations of the high-global-warming-potential replacements matched the predictions made back in 2007. As it turns out, Montzka says, “Those earlier predictions were pretty darn accurate.” So while 2050 is still a long way off, the measurements to date suggest that the climate concerns about the rising concentrations of CFC-replacement gases can’t be dismissed. I ask Montzka if he ever gets bored. He’s been doing this work for nearly a quarter of a century, after all. He and his colleagues have unpacked, tested, and re-packed thousands of flasks, calibrated hundreds of standards, fielded innumerable calls from scientists out in the field trying to fill a flask with a pump that won’t run right or any number of other problems. If there are aspects of the work that are painstaking and repetitive, he says, they are balanced by knowing he’s providing decision makers with critical scientific information.

We are providing feedback to the public and to policy makers about the effectiveness—or not—of those global measures [to reduce pollution]. We are providing the ground truth, to let them know whether their actions are making a difference,” he says. The carefulness and longevity of the flask program has also made new scientific discoveries possible. One of the important things we learned, according to Montzka, was how robust atmospheric cleansing processes are.   Many atmospheric chemicals—including methane and CFCs replacements—are removed by a single oxidant—a chemical scrubber called the hydroxyl radical. At the time of the Montreal Protocol, Montzka says, “We really didn’t know a lot about it. But by monitoring how fast a particular ozone-depleting substance disappeared [after it was banned], we could figure out what the global concentration of the cleansing hydroxyl radical must be and how variable it is from year to year. “ That knowledge about the cleansing mechanism makes the scientists more confident in their projections about when the ozone layer will ultimately recover. It also provides insight into the global warming potential of the various CFC-replacement gases. The warming potential is tied to how long they last in the atmosphere, which in turn depends on the how much of the cleansing hydroxyl radical exists—something we wouldn’t have understood as deeply without the flask program.

Because in addition to providing information to the public on things people care about, this program positions us to make scientific breakthroughs on key atmospheric issues facing us today.” Butler, J.

Providing more timely and accurate information over the Western hemisphere, total lightning mapping, and higher resolution images streaming down from space more often, the new mission marks the first major redesign of the nation’s operational Earth-observing technology in more than 20 years.  A United Launch Alliance Atlas V 541 lifts off with NASA's GOES-R satellite. GOES-R is the first of four satellites to be launched for NOAA in a new and advanced series of spacecraft. Once in geostationary orbit, it will be known as GOES-16. Taken on November 19, 2016. Credit:  . NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) have served as the foundation of the nation’s near real-time weather and environmental monitoring system since the launch of GOES-1 in 1975. GOES-1 only viewed the Earth every 30 minutes. Our current GOES East and GOES West satellites were launched in 2006 and 2010 respectively, and while they’ve come a long way from the technology of the 70s, all you have to do is think of how much your cell phone has changed since 2006 and you can understand why our weather satellites were due for an upgrade. (Hint: The first generation iPhone came out in 2007).  On the left is the first image obtained from the GOES-1 satellite. October 25, 1975. On the right is an image from Japan’s Himawari-8 satellite, whose advanced imager is similar to GOES-R's. Images from NOAA Photo Library via  , and NOAA/JMA via  . “We’ve been flying operational geostationary satellites for 41 years now, and for the last 22 years we’ve been flying the same basic instrument design,” said Steve Goodman, senior scientist for the GOES-R program. “This is the first major upgrade in 22 years.” GOES-R launched with six key instruments, with two pointing towards the Earth, two focused on the surrounding space environment, and two more keeping an eye on the sun.  For monitoring Earth’s weather climate research, it’s the two pointing towards Earth that are the most exciting. An artist's rendering of GOES-R in space. Credit:  . The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) will be the go-to instrument for imaging Earth’s weather, land, oceans, and climate. It’s called an imager, rather than just a “camera,” because it captures way more than the visible wavelengths of light that are captured by a camera for a regular photograph. The new imager will view the Earth through 16 different wavelengths (or spectral bands) ranging from visible to infrared. A   put it like this: “It’s as if the imager has 16 different types of sunglasses, each one allowing only a certain wavelength...of light to come through.” Those 16 different spectral bands include two visible channels, four near-infrared channels, and 10 infrared channels. That’s a big step up from the current GOES imager, which can only see in 5 bands total.

It’s not just NOAA that’s improving imager capabilities. According to Goodman, the European, Japanese, South Korean, and Chinese meteorological agencies are introducing higher spatial resolution on their latest satellites. “All of the global geostationary satellites are going to go from 5 to 16 channels,” said Goodman. “That will give us better resolution and more accurate data all around the world.” In addition to giving scientists more wavelengths to choose from, GOES-R will be able to scan the Earth five times faster than the current system. To put that in perspective, this satellite can scan the entire Western Hemisphere as often as every 5 minutes.  “When severe weather, hurricanes, and other rapidly evolving environmental phenomena form, scientists and satellite operators can switch the satellite into a regional rapid-scan operating mode and capture images updated as quickly as every 30 seconds, compared to every 7 minutes or more with the current GOES technology in rapid-scan imaging mode,” ABI Imagery Team Lead Tim Schmit said in an email. “With GOES-R, meteorologists and forecasters will have weather data as it happens to work with.” Artist's Rendition of GOES-R's Advanced Baseline Imager. Credit: ITT Exelis One big problem with the current GOES imager is that if scientists wanted to highlight an individual, high-impact weather event, they have to stop scanning the rest of hemisphere. “With the new ABI adaptive imaging capability, we don’t have to cut off South America anymore,” said Goodman. “We can keep scanning the whole Western Hemisphere.” Satellites in   get snapshots of the globe two or four times a day. The current GOES imager gets a full-disk (entire hemisphere at once) image up to 8 times daily.  GOES-R has four different operating modes, but it the default mode will take at least 4 full-disk images an hour: 96 in a day. “And we can monitor the faster changing weather or the evolution of clouds at four times the resolution [geographic detail] that we had before,” said Goodman. About one third of the   are cloud-related. This is because clouds play such a vital role in the Earth’s weather and climate system by regulating the amount of energy that reaches and leaves the planet. The more heat energy trapped beneath cloud cover, the warmer the climate grows. The more solar energy reflected back into space, the cooler the climate. Whether the cooling or warming effect dominates now—and whether that will change in the future—is a major source of uncertainty about future climate. With the new imager’s higher resolution and near continuous observations, “we expect to unravel a lot more detail about clouds, the climate, and the role of clouds in the climate system,” said Goodman. In fact, 12 of the imager’s 16 bands can be used to monitor cloud properties. During the onset and development of extreme weather events, scientists have found that rapid growth and cooling at the tops of clouds are indicators of the potential for severe weather. Using the infrared bands, the imager can show more detailed changes in cloud-top features, helping scientists assess the potential size and severity even before a storm reaches its peak and bolstering existing weather radar systems.

The higher-resolution data is going to help on the ground, as well, with wildfire detection. “With four times better resolution, what used to look like one large fire will now better pinpoint individual fires.” The ABI 3.9 micron [heat-detecting] channel is more sensitive, and the saturation temperature increases from 350K to 400K, allowing scientists to more accurately calculate fire radiative power as well as the location of fires and hot spots. Other beneficiaries of GOES-R’s improvements are climate and weather modelers. The first global climate models were very different than what we have now and were designed to simulate only the circulation of the atmosphere. Over time, as better data and more computing resources became available, ocean, cloud, land surface, ice, snow, and other features were added. Modelling grids are often less accurate in simulations because there isn’t any data on what is happening at a particular location or altitude at any given time. With the ABI’s new (and improved) data, climatologists will be able to incorporate three times more spectral information at four times greater resolution into future models. “Not only are we getting useful operational products [from GOES], but we’re helping the models improve,” said Goodman. The GOES-R Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), Credit:  . GOES-R’s other Earth-facing instrument, and the GOES-R instrument that Goodman himself is most excited, is the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM). The GLM works by taking 500 images per second and comparing each individual pixel to capture the origin and extent of a lightning flash. Mapping the initiation and proliferation of each flash, the mapper will detect in-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, and cloud-to-ground lightning activity throughout the day and night. Often, the frequency of lightning within a storm will rapidly increase ahead of other severe weather indicators like precipitation, high winds, and hail, which can be picked up by ground-based weather radars. The ability to spot lightning early could add minutes of valuable warning time in advance of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms. “I’m looking forward to the lightning mapper because I began work on it in 1979,” said Goodman, who added that he’s interested to see what another 20 years of lightning observations from space will add to the 17 years of existing lightning data collected in low earth-orbit from NASA research satellites. The aviation industry is also looking forward to the Lightning Mapper. Current ground-based radar systems don’t cover trans-oceanic routes, and the detection systems on planes frequently can’t look past the horizon. At a storm-scale resolution of about 10 kilometers (about 6 miles), GOES-R’s mapper will measure total lightning activity over the Americas and the adjacent ocean regions. Combined with the advancements of the ABI, the mapper will benefit pilots and dispatchers with more accurate and timely weather hazard information. Goodman added that the new data from the mapper might provide some new information about lightning formation during climate events like the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During the strong 1997-1998 El Nino event, scientists measured twice as many days with lightning off the U.S. Gulf Coast, compared to a normal year.  “As we have another 20 years of observations from the lightning mapper, we’ll be able to see if we have changes in the structure, frequency, distribution, or trends of storms and extreme weather, and perhaps serve as an additional indicator of inter-annual to decadal changes in thunderstorms or their intensity,” said Goodman. “That should add something to our knowledge of the climate system.” GOES-R reached orbit—22,300 miles above Earth—on November 29 and officially changed its call sign to GOES-16. On December 8, it will begin 30 days of “outgassing” to make sure that there are no contaminants on the detectors or the instruments. NOAA scientists won’t actually open up the telescope doors and start testing the instruments until around Day 48. The public can expect to see their first GOES-R images in early 2017 with regular images available in the spring, said Goodman. It’s not clear yet whether GOES-R will replace GOES East (75 W) or GOES West (137 W), but Goodman said that decisions should be made by summer. GOES-S, the next satellite of this generation, is planned to launch in 2018.  If all goes as planned, the four GOES-R series satellites, –R, –S, –T and –U, will continue NOAA’s geostationary coverage through 2036.   GOES-R Homepage:  Product Overview:  NESDIS GOES-R:  NESDIS:  Walsh, J., D. et al. 2014: Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement.

The technique may help expand the pre-satellite record of tropical cyclone activity. ", "content": "After last year’s devastating U.S. hurricane season, it’s only natural to wonder—as many did in  —if 2017’s ferocity had something to do with global warming or if it was just a destructive reminder of natural climate variability.   Despite how much NOAA and other scientists would like to answer this question, hurricane activity varies so much from year to year and decade to decade that it’s difficult for us to detect any long-term trends with the records we have; consistent, global satellite data only go back to around the 1960s. Prior to the satellite era, our records of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones is incomplete. Imagine if this trio of hurricanes that lined up in the Atlantic on September 16, 2010, had occurred a hundred years ago. How much would we know today about Karl's landfall in Mexico (left), Igor's path across the Caribbean (center), or even the existence of Julia (far right). NOAA satellite image.   But if records from the sky can’t do the trick, it might be time to look to records from the ground.   That’s the thinking behind a recent study from a team of seismically minded scientists led by Lucia Gualtieri of Princeton University and Suzana Carmago of Columbia University. Partially supported by funding from NOAA’s Climate Program Office, the team investigated 13 years of data on tropical cyclones and seismic noise around the northwest Pacific Ocean. In their resulting  , published online in  in December 2017, they describe a method for estimating tropical cyclone strength from seismic records alone. The technique could provide us with decades more information on cyclone activity and may reveal previously hidden trends that would help us better understand and predict how hurricane seasons may change in the future. When a hurricane hits, the swirling winds, pounding waves, and rising storm surge probably wash any thought of seismic records from most people’s minds. But Gualtieri and her colleagues knew that tropical cyclones leave imprints on the seismic record. Old-school seismometers used a large pendulum suspended from a grounded frame. The pendulum remained stationary while the frame moved with the shaking of the Earth. Attached to the pendulum, a pen traced the movements onto a drum of paper connected to the moving frame. The large spikes within the squiggly lines on a seismogram indicate seismic events like earthquakes and volcanoes.  Barely wavy lines record the ambient seismic noise, mostly produced by ocean waves. Photograph from Weston Observatory, used under a  Modern instruments no longer use pendulums, but they abide by the same principle. When a seismic event occurs, differences in the relative motion between a weight and a grounded frame generate an electric signal that a computer then translates into a seismogram. Both old-school and modern seismometers record dramatic seismic events as sharp spikes. But when a seismometer scribbles out the Earth’s trembling, a lot more shows up than just earthquakes and volcanoes. A constant background hum vibrates through the Earth. That normal, everyday activity is called “ambient seismic noise.” Many sources contribute to that ambient seismic noise, but the main one is ocean waves interacting with each other and sending pressurized forces towards the seafloor. During a tropical cyclone, large and powerful waves swirl and collide with each other as the winds spiral in different directions. Those supercharged wave collisions create seismic signals that rise just enough above the ambient noise for Gualtieri and her team to pick them out and use them to analyze cyclone strength. While geologists have known since the early twentieth century that cyclones leave behind these seismic traces, previous studies were mostly case studies that described the seismic details of one storm at a time. Gualtieri’s team—which included seismologists, atmospheric scientists, and a statistician—had a more ambitious goal. They wanted to find a way to categorize   tropical cyclones of Category 1 strength or higher. Researchers were able to estimate the intensity and life cycle of Typhoon Jelawat and other tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific between 2011 and 2012 based solely on the imprint the storms left in the seismic record.

Using satellite data, they zoomed in on the segments of the seismic record that coincided with those storms and developed a model linking the strength of the seismic signal to the strength of the cyclone. They then tested this model on the cyclone data for 2011-2012 and found that it successfully teased out the storms’ intensities.  “We got very good estimates,” said Gualtieri, “but not quite as good as satellite data.” Observed (black) and estimated (red) intensities for three tropical cyclones in the northwest Pacific Ocean during September-October 2012. The slight mismatch in timing between the observed and estimated intensities likely results from the slow build-up of winds and waves strong enough to generate a seismic signals. Climate.gov graph adapted from   (2017).  More of a surprise for her, and as she said, “I tried to resist this,” was that despite how complex the mechanism is that creates these tropical cyclone signals in the ambient noise, the actual relationship between storm intensity and the strength of the seismic signal can be described as linear. As Gualtieri explained it, “a linear relationship is one to one, or two to two, or three to three.” So in regards to her research, “it means that your tropical cyclone has the same power as the detected seismic signal. This linear relationship has significance because it allows us to more easily see changes [over time]. When you have a one to one relationship, the computations of strength are easier and so are the comparisons between cyclones.” Because of the relatively short record of worldwide cyclone activity, there’s no consensus on whether or not the frequency or intensity of tropical cyclones has increased due to human-caused global warming. But seismic data has been collected since the beginning of the twentieth century. If scientists can unearth some of these historic seismic records and identify past cyclones, Gaultieri’s results show that they should be able to calculate how strong the tropical cyclones were as they blustered their way across the oceans. The approach could add decades’ worth of storm intensity data to the historical record. Currently, Gualtieri is working to refine her team’s technique and to apply it to other ocean basins around the world. A key step will be to come up with a systematic way to find past cyclones in the seismic record. In general, they know that the amplitude of a cyclone’s signature makes it stand out from ambient seismic noise, but they will need to pinpoint unique characteristics if they want to leverage historic seismic records to detect unknown cyclones. In the meantime, researchers may be able to leverage other forms of historic records, such as old newspapers, to locate past cyclones in the seismic record. If it works, seismic noise data could not only improve historic understanding of tropical cyclones, but also better inform us of what to expect from tropical cyclones in the future.

The Normals are 30-year averages of key climate observations made at weather stations and corrected for bad or missing values and station changes over time. From the daily weather report to seasonal forecasts, the Normals are the basis for judging how temperature, rainfall, and other climate conditions compare to what’s normal for a given location in today’s climate. For the past decade, the Normals have been based on weather observations from 1981 to 2010. In early May, climate experts at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information will be releasing an updated collection—hourly, daily, monthly, and annual Normals for thousands of U.S. locations, states, regions—based on the weather experienced from 1991 to 2020. Alongside the questions about when the new Normals will be released (first week of May), we’ve gotten a lot of questions about the Normals and  . Is global warming affecting the Normals? (Yes). Are the Normals adjusted to “subtract out” global warming? (No.)  So the new normal reflects our changing climate? (Yes). Then how do we keep track of what used to be normal? (Different analyses.) The last   took place in 2011, when the baseline shifted from 1971-2000 to 1981-2010. Among the highlights of the rollout was the creation of a map showing how climate-related planting zones across the contiguous United States had shifted northward in latitude and upward in elevation. It was a clear signal that normal overnight low temperatures across the country were warmer than they used to be.   Changes in U.S. climate-related planting zones between the 1971-2000 Normals and the 1981-2010 Normals. Many places' coldest temperatures of the year grew warmer between the two periods, leading to a shift in plant hardiness zones. NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NCEI. Explore an  The planting zone maps emphasized a key point about the Normals and climate change: the once-per-decade update means these products gradually come to reflect the “new normal” of climate change caused by global warming. What’s normal today is often very different than what was normal 50 or 100 years ago. This gradual adjustment is the point: the purpose of the Normals is to provide context on what climate is like today, not how it’s changing over time. The U.S. Climate Normals collection has 10 versions: 1901-1930, 1911-1940, and so on through 1991-2020. In the image below, we’ve compared the U.S. annual average temperature during each Normals period to the 20 -century average (1901-2000). Places where the annual temperature during a given Normals era was colder than the 20 -century average are blue; places where the temperature was warmer than average are red. Annual U.S. temperature compared to the 20th-century average for each U.S. Climate Normals period from 1901-1930 (upper left) to 1991-2020 (lower right). Places where the normal annual temperature was 1.25 degrees or more colder than the 20th-century average are darkest blue; places where normal annual temperature was 1.25 degrees or more warmer than the 20th-century average are darkest red. Maps by NOAA Climate.gov, based on analysis by Jared Rennie, North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies/NCEI. Individual maps ( ). The influence of long-term global warming is obvious: the earliest map in the series has the most widespread and darkest blues, and the most recent map has the most widespread and darkest reds. Today, the normal annual temperatures across the country are warmer than the 20th-century average virtually everywhere. From 1901-1930, the annual average temperature was mostly colder than the 20th-century average. What’s also obvious in these comparisons is that the influence of global warming on normal U.S. temperature isn’t the same everywhere or during every 30-year period on record. Otherwise, the maps would have transitioned gradually from dark blue everywhere to dark red everywhere. In fact, a few locations do exhibit that pattern of gradual, steady warming from one Normals era to the next. Southeastern Oregon. Southern Florida. You can probably spot others. But in many places, the pace of warming changes from decade to decade due to other climate influences, both natural and human (think the Dust Bowl and smokestack pollution before the Clean Air Act). For example, in much of the U.S. Gulf Coast region, the maps show that normal annual temperatures were actually warmer than the 20 -century average in the first four sets of Normals. Beginning with the 1941-70 Normals, they reverted, with normal annual temperature growing increasingly cooler over the next two periods. That cooling pattern began to weaken with the 1971-2000 Normals, and it has all but disappeared today. “It varies” is the main message of the maps showing how the normal annual precipitation across the country has changed. Precipitation—regardless of human-caused climate change—varies a lot from place to place across the United States. Few places exhibit a precipitation trend that is either steadily wetter or steadily drier than the 20 -century average. Instead, drier areas and wetter areas shift back and forth without an obvious pattern. Normal annual U.S. precipitation as a percent of the 20th-century average for each U.S. Climate Normals period from 1901-1930 (upper left) to 1991-2020 (lower right). Places where the normal annual precipitation was 12.5 percent or more below the 20th-century average are darkest brown; places where normal annual precipitation was 12.5 percent or more wetter than the 20th-century average are darkest green. Maps by NOAA Climate.gov, based on analysis by Jared Rennie, North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies/NCEI. Individual maps ( ). For example, the Southwest was much wetter than the 20 -century average in the 1901-30 and 1911-40 Normals, and then mostly drier than the 20 -century average in the next four Normals. The 1961-90 Normals were a mix, with few areas either very wet or dry relative to the 20 -century average. The next two Normals periods—1971-2000 and 1981-2010— were once again much wetter than the 20 -century average across much of the Southwest, but the pattern has reversed in the new Normals. That inconsistency isn’t surprising, despite the fact that human-caused climate change likely is influencing U.S. precipitation in some places and seasons. It’s just that what controls precipitation varies so much from place to place and month to month that the influence of global warming also varies a lot. Some parts of the country are   to see increases in annual average precipitation, and others may see decreases. Some may see wetter winters but drier summers, with little net change in annual average precipitation—but big impacts on natural ecosystems and agriculture that depend on a certain seasonal cycle. Some will see a shift in the type or intensity of precipitation without seeing a change in their annual total. More rain, less snow. More downpours, with longer dry spells between. With all this nuance, it’s not surprising that precipitation maps don’t show the same unmistakable fingerprint of climate change that the temperature maps do. And yet, it’s probably not a coincidence that the last four maps in the series—the 1961-1990, 1971-2000, 1981-2010, and 1991-2020 Normals—are nationally the four wettest-looking maps in the collection. At least some of that wetness relative to the 20 -century average is linked to the overall warming and “wetting” of the atmosphere that’s occurred as rising temperatures enhance evaporation of water from the ocean and land surface. The 1991-2020 Normals tell us what is normal in today’s climate. NOAA does other analyses that tell us about what used to be normal. For its monthly and annual  , temperature averages and precipitation totals   since 1895, with many states ranking towards warm extremes recently.

Having the entire 20  century included for comparison means the baseline captures more of the range of natural variability that’s possible in U.S. and global climate. It also provides a reasonable—but conservative—indication of the influence of long-term warming on temperatures. For the end-of-year  , NOAA also includes an additional comparison of the current year’s temperature to average temperatures from the 21-year period from 1880-1901, when the influence of global warming was still small relative to natural variability.

A new law in New York requires state agencies to start thinking ahead about increases in extreme rain  and other climate change risks.", "content": "A new Community Risk and Resiliency Act recently   by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo requires state agencies to consider future risks posed by climate change. While sea level rise and storm surge are big concerns along the New York’s coast, communities across the entire state will need to consider the impact of heavier and more frequent extreme rainfall events in a warmer future. Heavy downpours have increased across much of the country; the largest increase has been in the Northeast. In the top map, the different shades of blue show percent increases in the amount of precipitation that falls in very heavy events (the heaviest 1 percent of all daily events) from 1958 to 2012 for each U.S. region (insets are not to scale). Yellowish brown indicates decreases. Between 1958 and 2010, the fraction of total rainfall in the Northeast that came down in very heavy events increased by more than 70 percent. Projections of future climate suggest that the recent trend toward increased heavy precipitation events will continue in a warmer future for much of the Unites States. The bottom map shows the factor by which the frequency of extreme daily precipitation events is projected to increase by the later part of this century (2081-2100) compared to the later part of last century (1981-2000) across the United States (insets are not to scale). In this case, “extreme daily precipitation” means a daily amount that now occurs just once in 20 years. Under a scenario assuming continued increases in carbon dioxide emissions ( ), these events would occur at least twice as often in almost every part of the continental United States—not just in the eastern half of the country, but even in regions where   precipitation may decrease, such as the Southwest. The Northeast region is projected to expect extreme rain events up to four times more often under the increasing emissions scenario. The western half of Alaska could experience these events up to six times more often. These trends are widely thought to be associated with the fact that warmer air temperatures fuel more evaporation, which leads to a wetter atmosphere. Scientists have measured a significant increase in specific humidity (the volume of water vapor) over the Earth’s surface, which is consistent with the long-term warming trend in our planet's average surface temperature. Climate change also alters atmospheric processes that in turn affect weather patterns and storms. According to the  , the impacts of more frequent extreme precipitation events will be particularly acute for the Northeast. Heavier rain could exacerbate floods that disrupt traffic and transportation, overburden stormwater and runoff systems, damage property and infrastructure, and reduce crop yields due to excess water or field flooding, among other impacts. There has already been an increase in flooding events in the Midwest and Northeast, where the nation's largest increases in heavy rain have occurred. According to the Community Risk and Resiliency Act, the state must consider these trends toward more heavy rain events in certain permitting, funding, and regulatory decisions for activities such as smart growth assessments, construction of wastewater treatment plants, and maintenance of transportation infrastructure for hazardous waste. In a press release announcing the legislation, Governor Cuomo said, “The new reality of extreme weather has had painful consequences for New Yorkers in virtually every region of our state, but today we’re taking another step forward in our goal of building back better, stronger, and more resilient than ever before.” Maps by NOAA Climate.gov, based on   and   of the  .

Could history repeat itself?", "content": "New England has weathered its share of battering storms, and even an occasional tornado. With a few notable exceptions, however, most hurricanes that swirl northward along the East Coast veer out into the Atlantic without making landfall. Not so in 1938. The \"Great New England Hurricane of 1938,\" also known as \"The Long Island Express\" or simply \"The Big One,\" blindsided New Englanders that year, striking without warning in the afternoon of September 21. The Great New England Hurricane of 1938 started as a tropical cyclone off of Cape Verde, Africa, on September 10. After threatening Florida on September 20, it moved north, and most forecasters believed it would head northeast to spin itself out in the North Atlantic Ocean. Instead, the storm accelerated northward, reaching forward speeds of up to 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, on a beeline for the southern shore of New England. Map courtesy of Hunter Allen. Late in the day on September 19, 1938, weather forecasters who had alerted Floridians of the possibility of a hurricane landfall saw that the storm had turned north. As the storm seemed to be heading out to sea, most of them breathed a sigh of relief and went home. Forecasts issued for the eastern seaboard that day contained high wind and gale advisories, but made no mention of a hurricane. Most of the ships that might have reported the storm's location had retreated to shore, waiting for the hurricane to spin itself out in the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Essentially unwatched, the hurricane abruptly tripled its northward speed, and traveled the 425 miles (700 km) from Cape Hatteras to Long Island in less than 8 hours. When the storm plowed across Long Island and slammed into Connecticut, it was a Category 3 hurricane. The storm's rapid northward motion amplified the wind speeds on the east side of the storm, and buildings disintegrated under the force of wind-driven waves and rain. In an example of spectacularly bad timing, landfall occurred at the same time as high tide, maximizing the height of the deadly surge of seawater that was pushed ashore by the storm. In the New England Hurricane of 1938, fishing boats and yachts were carried ashore by waves and wind. Here, homeowners found a large boat and industrial debris deposited in their yard. Photo by A. Morgan Stewart,The Day, courtesy of Peg Van Patten. Beaches in Connecticut and Rhode Island were stripped clean of the summer cottages that had crowded their shores, and fishing boats were tossed about like toys, some settling as far as a mile inland. One startling arrangement of debris was a boat that had crashed right into a funeral parlor. As is common with strong hurricanes, many people died by drowning as the storm surge flooded their homes, schools, and businesses. After battering the coast, the hurricane moved north, right into the heart of New England. When it was over, 57,000 homes from the Bahamas to Quebec were damaged or destroyed and around 600 people were dead (estimates vary). Total property damage from \"The Big One\" in New England was estimated at over $300 million in 1938-equivalent to almost $5 billion in 2010 dollars. Even when compared with the devastating Category 4 and 5 hurricanes that made landfall in the United States in 2004 and 2005, the Great Hurricane of 1938 still ranks as one of the most costly and deadly hurricanes in United States history. What if another major hurricane were to hit New England this year? Would residents fare any better than they did in 1938? My dad was a 29-year old freelance newspaper reporter then, writing mostly for   newspaper in New London, Connecticut. He recalled that the morning of September 21 had been a perfect beach day. As the storm approached and its severity became obvious, Dad fought his way to the school to retrieve my older brother, Russ, and brought him home. Russ recalls crouching behind an armchair, covered by his mother's body. When Dad shouted, \"Here it comes!!\" Russ remembers hearing an unearthly roaring sound, like a train thundering by at top speed. Peg Van Patten, of Connecticut Sea Grant. Russ was one of the lucky ones. Many children died in the storm, drowned where they huddled in a library, or tossed about by the violent waves that crashed ashore. In Rhode Island, a school bus, including children and driver, was washed out to sea and lost. My grandparents, who had a coastal farm on Barn Island, had gathered refugees in their home. As the group fled 12-foot waves to higher ground, they spotted a naked corpse in the yard. Fishermen in Stonington, Connecticut, carry a wicker basket containing human remains found at the waterfront. The hurricane totally destroyed about 2,600 fishing vessels and damaged about 3,400 more.

My dad, who had a considerable vocabulary, was so shocked at the devastation he saw that evening and the following day that he could hardly write. Instead, he relied on his camera, and took many photos to tell the story. Much of the city of New London had burned after sparks from downed power lines caused businesses and a coal company to catch fire.   lost power, but sent its reporters and photographers out into what it later called \"the Stygian darkness\" and through smoke like \"the devil's furnace,\" at risk to their lives. The combined effects of the hurricane-winds, floods, and fire-caused $4 million in property damage in New London alone.

Many of my father's photographs show the Bostonian train, which miraculously escaped entrapment as it went through five feet of water on a swaying trestle bridge between Mystic and Stonington, Connecticut. In Stonington, with all the passengers huddled in one car, the train tipped off the tracks in waist-deep water, and passengers had to leap out into the wind and water and wade to safety. Hurricanes arrive in New England only about once per decade, on average, but they are still part of the region's climate. As such, people shouldn't wonder \"If\" the Northeast will experience another hurricane like that of 1938, but rather \"When?\" Twelve significant tropical cyclones made landfall in New England between 1900 and 2009. Storm intensity at landfall is given by  , which uses wind speeds to classify the intensity of tropical cyclones as tropical storms or hurricanes of specific categories. The table also shows the forward motion of each storm at the time of landfall. Average forward motion of storms that have come ashore in New England is over 30 miles (50 km) per hour, well above the average speed of 10-12 miles (16-20 km) per hour observed for hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Data provided by NOAA’s National Weather Service. Twelve significant tropical cyclones made landfall in New England during the past 11 decades. Storm intensity at landfall is given by the  , which uses wind speeds to classify the intensity of tropical cyclones as tropical storms or hurricanes of specific categories. The table also shows the forward motion of each storm at the time of landfall. Average forward motion of storms that have come ashore in New England is over 30 miles (50 km) per hour, well above the average speed of 10-12 miles (16-20 km) per hour observed for hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Data provided by NOAA's National Weather Service. A single hurricane is an extreme weather event. Predicting the timing of the next one to come ashore in New England is far beyond meteorologists' current abilities. However, patterns of hurricane frequency and intensity over time and space are connected to climate, and climate scientists are working hard to figure out if and how our changing global climate might affect hurricane patterns. Especially since 2005, when a series of strong hurricanes resulted in large numbers of casualties and billions of dollars in property damage in the United States, people have been concerned that global warming might increase the number or intensity of hurricanes that form. Understanding how Earth's changing climate will affect patterns of hurricanes involves a range of complex factors. For example, as the temperature of the ocean's surface increases, more heat energy is available to fuel tropical systems, so the intensity of hurricanes that form might increase. However, increases in air temperatures can enhance the difference in pressure and wind speeds at different altitudes, leading to conditions that interfere with cyclone development, so the number of storms that form might decrease. A broad community of NOAA scientists and other researchers around the world are actively working with historical records, data from lab experiments, and global climate models to understand and predict the characteristics of future hurricanes. As of early 2010, some of the most prominent tropical cyclone researchers in the United States agree that in a warmer world, hurricanes may form less frequently, yet the ones that do form may be slightly stronger than those of the past. For more information about new hurricane research, please see Satellites, Planes, and Hurricanes (available July 15, 2010) Despite our uncertainty about when, where, and how intense future hurricanes will be, we can estimate the impacts they may have on property. Based on population density, infrastructure, and personal wealth of residents along the shores of New England, a study published in   in 2008 estimated that the price tag for a Category 3 hurricane in that region today could be as high as $70 billion. To put that amount into perspective, consider that if you spent a million dollars every day, it would take almost 200 years to spend that much money! If residents of the Northeast receive an order to evacuate as a hurricane approaches, Interstate 95 and Merritt Parkway might need to be used as one-way routes, moving in either direction, to maximize the flow of traffic.

If residents of the Northeast receive an order to evacuate as a hurricane approaches, Interstate 95 and Merritt Parkway might need to be used as one-way routes, moving in either direction, to maximize the flow of traffic. Image courtesy of Hunter Allen. We can also assess the capability of existing transportation infrastructure to facilitate an emergency evacuation of the region. In July 2008, speakers at the Northeast Hurricane Mitigation Leadership Forum expressed concern over the lack of sufficient roads to evacuate the dense population centers in the region. The Interstate 95 transportation corridor serves as a major traffic artery through the Northeast. If this highway remains passable, thousands of cars per hour will be able to use it for evacuation. If that route is blocked or damaged though, gridlock could occur, and the few routes left available could be overwhelmed. The potential for the Northeast to experience another \"Long Island Express\" is still very real. Results from  revealed the combination of low pressure over eastern North America and high pressure over the western North Atlantic Ocean that put the 1938 hurricane on the fast track to the north. Similar pressure patterns still occur today, so New England remains vulnerable to hurricanes that can close in on the region at speeds nearing the legal limit for cars traveling on a highway. Despite the risk, the potential for even fast-moving storms to arrive in New England without warning has diminished appreciably since 1938. An array of instruments around the world and continuous global coverage by satellites ensure that experts at NOAA's National Hurricane Center are aware of weather systems that might evolve into tropical cyclones. If a nascent storm develops the characteristics of a tropical cyclone, forecasters use a range of detailed observations to monitor its status and predict its likely path. If a tropical cyclone develops to the point that experts judge that it may endanger lives and property, the National Hurricane Center can send Air Force and NOAA planes to fly over or through the storm to drop instrument packages into the swirling masses of clouds. Data from the instruments help the scientists understand the storm's internal characteristics and potential for further strengthening. NOAA's high altitude jet, the Gulfstream IV, is equipped to drop small instrument packages on parachutes into storms. As the packages descend, they serve as miniature weather stations, continually measuring temperature, pressure, and humidity and sending the data back to the plane. The instruments also gather data that indicate horizontal and vertical wind speeds within the storm. Photo courtesy of NOAA.

Global-scale numerical weather models and forecast tools, constantly updated with real-time data to characterize the current state of the atmosphere, help forecasters predict the track that hurricanes will follow. These tools have improved the accuracy of forecasts tremendously, cutting errors in storm track forecasts in half since 1995. Beginning with the 2010 hurricane season, the National Hurricane Center will announce a   for specified coastal areas 48 hours in advance of the time that hurricane conditions are considered   within that area. If hurricane conditions are   for a specified coastal area, a   of those conditions will be issued at least 36 hours before they arrive. With today's forecast capabilities and communications available through the Internet, television, cell phones, and radio, it seems inconceivable that residents of New England could be surprised again by a land-falling hurricane. But as recent attempts to evacuate huge cities have shown, receiving ample warning in advance of an approaching hurricane is only part of the solution. To increase chances for survival, residents also need to plan ahead and know how to access and use timely information about the best options and pathways for getting out of harm's way. Each year, as hurricane season approaches, New Englanders who know about the Great Hurricane of 1938 still brace for the possibility that a similar storm will arrive. As hurricane seasons end, scientists compile data on all the new storms, and consider them within the context of the historical record. They look for the continuation of current trends, or a pattern that suggests a new trend has begun. Through the study of past hurricanes and the complex climate system within which they form, scientists continue striving to increase the accuracy and lead-time of their predictions. Their ultimate goal is to provide enough warning so people have the opportunity to protect themselves and their property the next time another \"Big One\" comes around.

Climate change is expected to both intensify fire-friendly weather conditions, as well as lengthen the season during which very large fires tend to spread. The map at right shows the projected increase in the number of “very large fire weeks”—weeks in which conditions are favorable to the occurrence of very large fires—by mid-century (2041-2070) compared to the recent past (1971-2000). The darkest shades of red indicate that up to a six-fold increase is predicted across parts of the West. This area includes the Great Basin and Northern Rockies, as well as the Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains in Northern California. The potential for very large fire events is also expected to increase along the southern coastline and in the forests around the Great Lakes, although the number of events along the northern tier of the country should only increase moderately given the historically low potential for these events. For this study, researchers considered the average results of 17 climate model simulations to examine how the potential for very large fires is expected to change. Future projections* were based on a higher-emissions scenario called  , which assumes continued increases in carbon dioxide emissions. Along with the elevated potential for very large fires across the western US in future decades, other climate modeling studies have projected increases in fire danger and temperature, and decreased precipitation and relative humidity during the fire season. The increased potential for these extreme events is also consistent with an observed increase in the number of very large fires in recent decades. In addition, scientists have detected trends toward overall warming, more frequent heat waves, and diminished soil moisture during the dry season. The combination of these climate conditions and historic fire suppression practices that have led to the build-up of flammable debris have likely led to more frequent large fire events. At this very moment, more than 70 wildfires are burning throughout the West, putting homes, lives, and livelihoods at risk. The smoke created by these fires exacerbates chronic heart and lung diseases while also degrading visibility and altering snowmelt, precipitation patterns, water quality, and soil properties. In addition to public health impacts, projected trends in extreme fire events have important implications for terrestrial carbon emissions and ecosystems. The authors of the study also note that these findings could place a burden on national and regional resources for fighting fires. Fire suppression costs in the U.S. have more than doubled in recent decades, exceeding $1 billion per year since the year 2000, the National Interagency Fire Center reports.

Tears welled up alongside a sense of dread about how fast the world my two daughters are growing up in is changing. I remembered the fear I felt as a child when I learned how human-made chemicals were destroying Earth’s stratospheric ozone layer, which protects all life from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays. Transported back to my eight-year-old self, I recalled wearing an Earth Day t-shirt depicting the hole in the ozone layer with white and hot pink puff paint on a teal blue background. I felt powerless as a kid but believed grown-ups would find a solution, if they paid attention. I wore the t-shirt, feeling that was how I could do my part. Ultimately,   layer. Human emissions of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer—the layer of the atmosphere that protects life on Earth from ultraviolet radiation—dropped sharply in the 1990s following the Montreal Protocol. NOAA Climate.gov image adapted from  A drive to problem-solve in the face of distress has always been wired into my mindset. This drive is what led me to choose a career in medicine. However, as I headed in to work that day, trudging across the ice- and salt-encrusted parking lot, I felt deflated and powerless. I was the adult now, but I couldn’t see a path to healing. What could I do as a family doctor in Wisconsin to address the daunting problem of global warming? Amid the bustling pace of family medicine (delivering babies and treating diabetes and everything in between) and early motherhood (kissing scraped knees and bedtime stories and snuggles), it would take a few more years of doom scrolling news headlines and reading the latest climate research before I stumbled onto Yale University’s  .  Could this be the path to healing that I was seeking—becoming a “ ”?  At first, it seemed ill-advised to try tackling a graduate-level online course above and beyond my already overloaded work schedule. It was the summer of 2021, and I was exhausted. With the rest of the medical community, I was just coming up for air after navigating the chaos of the first wave of the COVID pandemic, only to face wave after wave of new variants as well as other health impacts of the pandemic—including worsened mental health, substance abuse, missed cancer screenings, debilitating effects of long COVID, and more.  But even amid the exhaustion, I recognized how I could apply lessons I learned from the COVID pandemic to the climate crisis, and I began to find hope. In the early days of the pandemic, we were playing defense and our health care systems were overwhelmed. We rushed to treat patients while conducting research, while learning about the rapidly evolving new disease in real time. But later, with more knowledge on transmission, adequate masks, at-home COVID tests, the advent of vaccines, and better communication strategies, we gradually shifted our efforts from treating symptoms to preventing infections. Elevating the importance of safe and healthy environments at home and work, we were able to integrate COVID prevention into the bigger picture of comprehensive wellness strategies for our patients and communities.  The pandemic was also a powerful reminder to me that as a medical student and physician, I trained and practiced skills to respond in times of crisis. Navigating the COVID pandemic as a family doctor and medical director forced me to refine those skills. I developed a sense of empowerment and a capacity to lean in and fully face disaster while acting to prevent further destabilization. Doctors are already called to respond to disasters caused by extreme weather and wildfires. If I—and other doctors—had more training, we could anticipate and plan to better manage and prevent changing health impacts due to global warming, and not just react to them in a pandemic-like crisis mode. In medical school and residency, we learned that environmental health and human health go hand-in-hand, but exploring the human health impacts of a rapidly changing environment driven by global warming had never been part of the discussion. So my next step on the path to becoming a climate doctor was to enroll in a year-long   at the University of Colorado. As I learned more about the intricate interactions between global warming, the environment, and human health, a veil was lifted. Now, I see clearly how climate-driven extreme events—such as heat waves, severe storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires—are increasingly harming both human and natural environments. Now I understand why these health hazards and others—such as poor air quality and the spread of insect-borne diseases—are very likely to worsen this century due to the buildup of human-emitted heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere (like carbon dioxide and methane). The threat of global warming brings a clear and present danger to human health and well-being.  Part of the hurricane preparedness plan for Tampa General Hospital—the region's only Level 1 Trauma Center—includes the deployment of a temporary sea wall capable of keeping out storm surge up to 15 feet.

For example, I studied temperature maps that reveal  , and I saw that the same disenfranchised communities that suffer the worst health equity gaps also face the highest heat exposure in the city, threatening physical and mental health further. I was encouraged to learn that solutions, like increased tree canopy, are associated with a multitude of health benefits. Trees help cool their immediate surroundings by providing shade and through evapotranspiration—much like how sweating helps to cool our bodies on hot days. And, research shows, trees offer other benefits such as   and    Kids play in a fountain in Battery Park, New York, on June 16, 2012. Many urban areas are working to increase tree cover and provide cooling features to help residents cope with extreme heat. Adapted from   by S.L. Used under a Creative Commons  I also learned about new opportunities for physicians to expand their knowledge base and develop systems and skills to meet the new health challenges presented by rapidly changing threats like heat and extreme weather. With these tools, here are four ways physicians can lead the way in protecting the health of our communities in the face of global warming and climate change:  Clinicians need to recognize increased prevalence of climate-driven exposures in their communities, such as wildfires, that affect their patients’ health. Three major ones are air quality, allergy season, and insect-borne diseases. For example, when Canadian wildfire smoke blew into Wisconsin in the summer of 2023, it caught local physicians on their heels. In an area not typically affected by wildfires, many clinicians were not practiced in counseling on health protection due to severely degraded air quality. My colleagues rapidly learned about and then taught patients how to use the   and     air filters for their homes.  A screenshot of the   showing the location of smoke (gray shading) and air quality conditions at monitoring stations (dots) on June 28, 2023. Smoke from fires in Canada pushed particle pollution in the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley region into the range considered \"unhealthy\" (red dots) and \"very unhealthy\" (purple dots). Image from the Environmental Protection Agency AirNow.gov website. Spring and Fall seasons are getting warmer, bringing   that cause more suffering from itchy, watery eyes, runny noses, and asthma flares. Clinicians can educate their patients on why their symptoms are getting worse, and how to protect themselves. Changes in temperatures and the length of growing seasons will allow mosquitoes, ticks, and other pests to carry diseases (like West Nile Virus, Lyme disease, alpha gal syndrome, dengue, and malaria) into new geographic regions. Greater exposure to infectious diseases means physicians may need to recognize signs and symptoms of illnesses that were previously not part of their day-to-day routine.  More education opportunities and peer-support initiatives are needed to help health professionals prepare for the myriad of  . I am now teaching a cohort of current and future physicians about the causes and effects of global warming, and helping them to connect the dots just like I did. Global warming is not some abstract threat far away or far in the future; rather,  .  The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased across much of the United States, particularly the eastern part of the continental US, with implications for flood risk and infrastructure planning. Maps show observed changes in three measures of extreme precipitation: (a) total precipitation falling on the heaviest 1% of days from 1958–2021. Numbers in black circles depict percent changes at the regional level. Data were not available for the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands and the US Virgin Islands. Image adapted from  We have seen   bringing significant impacts on physical and mental health among affected communities. These increases are linked to population growth and development, but they are also connected to climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identifies the   A greenhouse gas-warmed atmosphere is a “thirstier” atmosphere, with a greater capacity to hold more water vapor, creating conditions primed for intensified hurricanes, heavier rainfall, and more flooding. For example, preliminary analysis of Hurricanes   and   indicate that global warming increased their intensity and rainfall totals and made similar storms more likely than they would otherwise have been. On average, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) the atmosphere warms, it can hold 7 percent more water vapor. When atmospheric processes do trigger rain, that extra \"background\" water vapor can make it rain more heavily, leading to increased flooding.

One of the hottest areas in the US, in Phoenix and Maricopa County, has seen  Research shows that those who tend to be hurt first and worst are children, older adults, those with chronic diseases, and people of color living in under-resourced communities. While this type of climate science and health content was not always part of medical education, we see growing efforts to remedy the gap. For example, Dr. Gaurab Basu and medical student partners at Harvard Medical School have implemented a   to prepare medical students and doctors to face climate-related challenges.  An elderly woman faints from heat on New York City's Upper East Side in 2011. Photo from  /Marcus Santos. Clinicians can educate patients on their increasing exposure to climate-driven hazards; and then help them connect the dots on why their symptoms for existing conditions, like allergies and asthma, could worsen, and what they can do to protect themselves and their families. I find hope in prevention and proactive wellness management, just as I did while in the throes of the COVID pandemic.  I am inspired by the growing community of climate doctors who are mobilizing to heal our communities and our ailing planet. For example, one of my colleagues is sharing public health messaging on how “ ” (an approach to eating that centers fruits, vegetables, legumes and grains but is flexible to include smaller amounts of dairy, meats and seafood) simultaneously keep our brains and bodies healthier   help slow global warming. There’s a win-win!  Another colleague is working to protect and improve our youth’s mental health through  . Getting youth outside and involved in restoration projects protects the environment, helps them learn more about nature and gives them a sense of purpose and empowerment that, research shows, helps mitigate feelings of anxiety and depression. That’s a win-win-win!  As trusted science professionals, physicians can lend their expertise beyond the clinic and community health, and step into the realm of health systems and policy work. Physicians and other health professionals have aligned efforts in organizations like   and   to reduce the greenhouse gas pollution created by the health sector. For example, anesthesiologists are advocating to eliminate leaky and wasteful anesthetic gas systems and choose better agents for anesthesia that work just as well for patients but aren’t as harmful to our environment. A growing number of health organizations have signed the   to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases by 50% by 2030, and net zero by 2050; and to develop plans for making clinics and hospitals and the communities they serve more climate resilient. Groups of physicians and health professionals can advocate for this type of commitment from their employers. A few short years ago, I couldn’t see how to affect change in the face of the climate crisis as a family physician. Now, I see networks of health professionals working to combat the climate crisis and protect our communities. From the exam room to the classroom, climate doctors are treating patients, educating the public, and advocating for change with system leaders. To quote essayist and climate activist Rebecca Solnit, “Hope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. It is an ax you break down doors with in an emergency.” Through climate medicine, I have leaned in, learned, found solutions, and joined a movement for collective action. I have an ax in one hand to break out of this emergency, and a handful of seeds in the other hand to plant a new future for our loved ones and families to thrive. Anne Getzin, M.D., has started thinking of herself as a \"climate doctor,\" who can help her patients and community prepare for the impacts of climate change on human health.

Photo courtesy the city of Boston. Sea level rise and storm surge get a lot of attention. And certainly in the post-Sandy environment we’ve been spending a lot of time both dealing with our current vulnerabilities to major storm events and future vulnerabilities associated with increasing sea level rise. But we’re also at the end of the storm-water system for much of Eastern Massachusetts, so we’re worried about  —inland flooding is a big concern. Also, as with any city around the country, heat waves and the urban heat island effect are big concerns. We’ve experienced some significant heat waves over the last several years. During a heat wave last summer, they actually had to downgrade the power output coming out of the nearby nuclear power station. Because the seawater was so warm, it didn’t supply that temperature difference to adequately cool to the degree necessary to run the plant at full capacity. So we are very concerned about scenarios like that. At the exact same time everyone is turning on their air conditioning to deal with a major heat event, our power system is less reliable and is vulnerable as things start to snowball. So we spend a lot of time talking about infrastructure. Boston is one of a number of coastal cities facing [these challenges]. If you add up the 20 largest cities in the U.S. by metro GDP, 10 of them are coastal and they represent about 30 percent of the U.S. economy. This is not just a challenge for the sake of: “Do we want to protect a couple of cities around the country?” This is a national economic imperative to figure out how to provide climate change preparedness to the urban environments along the coast. If we don’t, that’s a significant chunk of our [national] economy that’s at risk. The resilience and preparedness of a neighborhood is not just about the structures and the infrastructure. It’s also about the people and making sure that we take advantage of opportunities to get ourselves ready both in the long term as well as, if it’s a storm event like a hurricane, 48 to 72 hours ahead of time. We need to understand the things we need to do to make ourselves less vulnerable. And we need to understand what to do during the storm to make sure we’re as protected and safe as possible. We need to empower folks with the right information and tools and resources to make good decisions, and to be ready for all the sorts of climatic hazard events that we anticipate. We’re making changes as we speak in terms of evaluating evacuation routes, evaluating evacuation zones, reaching out with more information on preparedness plans that families and individuals can pull together, and understanding what has worked in other cities that could work here. Making sure that we’re empowering folks so that they are as prepared as possible and things don’t catch them by surprise. Up here, we’re pretty good at preparing for snow events. If I told somebody, even in July, that we’re expecting 20 inches of snow in two days, everybody has that mental checklist up here in Boston: Make sure I know where the shovel is; I know the streets not to park on because there’ll probably be a parking ban; I got my bread and my milk; I’ve got salt for the walkway.  We don’t have that mental checklist up here for hurricanes and we certainly don’t drill for it the same way we drill for something like fire emergencies. We have fire evacuation drills, but I’ve never seen a commercial building in Boston do a flooding drill to see how they can make their building water tight; or drill to put out sand bags to temporarily stop water flow. Those are the types of things we need to start to get ready for before storms hit. We need to be proactive about hazards we are less familiar with because they’re more likely to happen going forward. The   by  , via  . We’ve always been a city that’s been living with water, so to speak.  We were known as the Shawmut Peninsula and there was a very small isthmus that’s present-day Washington Street that connected the three mountains of Beacon Hill to rest of the city. In a lot of respects, our city has always had a very close relationship with the water. Much of it is built on filled tide lands and so much of our history is tied to water-based activities and industry. We are embracing this challenge going forward. We’re definitely not calling retreat. It is a challenge on a scale — in terms of both the speed and the magnitude of the changes we’re facing — that no human habitation has faced before. But, here in Boston, we benefit from phenomenal intellectual capacity and an interest in thinking long term, and a connection to the water that’s going to have us develop solutions across the board at the building scale, the neighborhood scale, and the infrastructure scale. The most common advice I give is to bring the science to the sidewalk. That is both in terms of meeting people where they’re at in terms of conveying the reasons they should be interested in climate preparedness and using terminology that’s readily acceptable. You won’t hear me very often, unless I’m in front of a science group, use the words “resiliency” or “adaptation.” I think those are really wonky scientific terms that convey that we have more time than we do and they denote that this is something we’re thinking about for the next generation as opposed to now. I like the word “preparedness,” because when you talk about “storm preparedness” or “hazard preparedness” everyone wants more of that. They want to be better prepared. The other big thing is to find the folks in your cities and states that naturally have a longer-term perspective and work with them on partnerships at the outset, and then bring the rest of the folks on. In Boston, we’re blessed with a significant contingent of medical institutions and higher education institutions and they think in terms of 50-year plans. They’ve been around for 100 years and they want to be around for another 100 years, so they actually think in terms of long-term planning. Start with those types of institutions as your natural allies and then develop momentum and programs so that you can reach out to the broader community. Start with a coalition of those with a vested interest in the long-term vitality of your cities.   Help us improve our content"},

Mapping Urban Heat Islands in Richmond, Virginia | NOAA Climate.gov", "meta_description": "Richmond's citizen-scientists took to the streets on specially equipped bikes and cars to find out where it’s hottest—and where residents might be most vulnerable to extreme urban heat.", "content": "Richmond—the capital of Virginia—is situated on the James River amidst the low, rolling hills of the Virginia Piedmont. One of the nation’s oldest cities, Richmond boasts a population of almost 225,000. Walking through this dynamic city yields a wide range of culture, landscape...and temperatures. Similar to other cities across the mid-Atlantic region, Richmond experiences generally warm and humid summer days. And like other densely populated cities, the city experiences an urban heat island effect: unshaded roads and buildings across the city gain heat through the day and radiate it to the surroundings, increasing air temperature. As a result, highly developed areas experience warmer temperatures than surrounding areas. The inset image, taken with a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera, shows heat and is overlain on a regular photograph for context. In the FLIR image, lighter or brighter colors indicate warmer areas, while darker areas are cooler. While the urban heat island effect is generally described as a city being warmer than the surrounding rural areas, heat intensity can also vary from neighborhood to neighborhood within a city. For example, dark surfaces such as asphalt absorb more heat than lighter surfaces, and built materials such as bricks and concrete absorb more heat than grass and vegetation. This means that some sections of a city will face higher temperatures on hot days than others. This graph from the Climate Explorer shows observed and projected annual number of days above 95°F in Richmond. To explore similar data in your location, launch the  . Excessive heat is recognized as the greatest weather-related cause of death in the United States (for more information, visit the  and   pages). Since the 1970s, residents of Richmond have experienced an increase in the number of days over 95°F per year, and climate scientists expect that trend to continue. On these hotter days, Richmond hospitals see an increase in heat-related emergency room visits. To identify which Richmond neighborhoods get the hottest during heat waves, and how excessive heat might affect the neighborhoods’ most vulnerable residents, researchers needed to come up with a way to check local temperatures—block by block—across the city.  Dr. Jeremy Hoffman and Dr. Eugene Maurakis, scientists with the Science Museum of Virginia in Richmond, and Dr. Vivek Shandas, a professor of urban studies and planning at Portland State University, collaborated with Richmond community members, universities, and nonprofits to explore the city’s heat island effect. To assess urban heat in Richmond using methods developed by Shandas and his team at Portland State, they recruited citizen-scientists from several local organizations: students from the University of Richmond and Virginia Commonwealth University; the Virginia Academy of Science; the City of Richmond’s Sustainability Office; and Groundwork RVA, a Richmond nonprofit organization that engages young people with environmental and social issues in their communities. A youth volunteer from Groundwork RVA attaches a sensor unit onto a car. On July 13, 2017, in the midst of Richmond's first major heat wave of the summer, 15 teams of volunteers spread out through the city in cars and on bikes equipped with simple hand-made devices. Each device was designed to measure air temperature and mark time and location as it was moved along. By recording the temperature every second of each hour-long ride, and plotting those temperatures on a map, data from the devices could be used to generate a map of temperatures along each route over the entire city. Riders and drivers rolled through the heat on their assigned routes three times that day: at 6:00 am, at 3:00 pm, and again at 7:00 pm. All temperature and location data collected by the teams were fed into an open-source software package developed by Shandas’ team at Portland State. Processing the data this way allows researchers to relate different types of land use to air temperatures, even across areas that weren't directly measured. The resulting map showed a detailed picture of Richmond's urban heat across the entire city. The map showed differences of up to 16°F across Richmond’s neighborhoods during the hottest part of the day. This means that when a heavily shaded neighborhood in Richmond experiences an afternoon temperature of 87°F, it might reach 103°F in a more urbanized neighborhood in the same city. The data also revealed that warmer areas experienced a greater difference between morning and afternoon temperatures than did cooler areas. This map displays temperature data in Richmond from 3:00–4:00 pm on July 13, showing variable heat levels within the city depending on land use. Averaging measurements over census block groups and comparing the results with maps of land use showed that Richmond's warmest neighborhoods were generally those with the highest areas of impermeable surfaces and the lowest areas of tree canopy. These neighborhoods can sometimes be home to families with income levels below the poverty line—who may be more vulnerable to heat issues if they lack air conditioning. Not surprisingly, a review of locations where emergency responders typically respond to heat-related calls for help indicates that they are happening in these hottest areas, where people are most vulnerable. This map displays the urban heat vulnerability by census block group in Richmond. To quantify levels of urban heat vulnerability in different neighborhoods, researchers combined a range of factors with various weights into an index. Based on measurements of temperature, tree canopy, and concentration of impervious surfaces, and including census data on income levels, they defined a quantitative index that can help identify neighborhoods where residents may be at risk. Areas with a below-average index score show where adaptive action to decrease vulnerability to excessive heat may be most effective. Adaptive actions to consider in these areas might include planting more trees, creating artificial shade structures, or a longer-term strategy of changing building construction requirements, Many of the volunteers who participated in the heat mapping project also plan to be involved in bringing the findings to the public. Project participants are eager to take the next step by reaching out to neighborhoods where residents may be vulnerable to excessive heat events to help them develop tailored adaptation plans. Students use model homes to investigate differential heating in various surfaces. Groundwork RVA Green Team members—comprising local youth—have gained first-hand experience in understanding the way different surfaces absorb heat. In a project dubbed “Throwing Shade in RVA” using model homes in the Franklin Institute’s Ready Row Home exhibit, students used heat sensors and forward looking infrared (FLIR) cameras to measure and visualize heating differences among surfaces of various colors. Focusing on potential solutions that would incorporate the concept of green infrastructure, students designed a shade structure. The Throwing Shade project was partially funded by NOAA's Office of Education Environmental Literacy Program, and the Franklin Institute's Ready Row Home exhibit is provided through the Climate & Urban Systems Partnership, funded by the National Science Foundation. The ultimate goal of the heat mapping project is to promote the development of community-scale adaptation, and the limited reach of the study is what makes it unique. Satellites can provide a picture of urban heat islands the size of cities and on city surfaces, but those images can't show variations in air temperatures across neighborhoods or on the streets. Conditions in the places where human activity takes place is what matters most in this project. Keeping a strong focus on the human element—on volunteer citizen-scientists, on cars and bikes, in their own city—resulted in a human-relevant and detailed dataset that’s not available from other sources.  With this hazard and vulnerability information, the next stage of this project—following the  —will examine mitigation scenarios for providing cool locations in new and existing developments within the hottest parts of the city. The alternative development scenarios can be coupled with other priorities to cool neighborhoods, and ultimately save infrastructure and lives. Data from this project are currently being used to inform planning phase discussions about Richmond 300, a citywide master plan update; RVA Green 2050, a greenhouse gas emissions reduction plan; and the implementation of RVAH2O, a watershed management program focused on reducing stormwater runoff. Relevant city departments are also committing to collaborations with the Museum for ongoing climate resilience education initiatives and proposals. With projections of warming summers, the effects of urban heat islands on communities will likely be a growing concern across the country. Richmond’s Urban Heat Vulnerability assessment can be replicated in other locations: it used data records from the National Land Cover Database and the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, data available for nearly every city in the United States, and processed that data using open source code in R, a free statistical computation environment. All of these elements—from active participation of local citizen-scientists to using open-source software to collect and model data—make the heat mapping research in Richmond applicable to other cities across the United States.

By removing accumlated fuels, fire makes room for new growth and change. This renewal helps ensure the quality of traditional foods and cultural materials and serves as a medium of cultural education. Ceremonies surrounding fire strengthen the Tribe's social networks and enhance its members' physical and mental health. The Karuk tribe's ancestral lands (outlined in yellow) along the Klamath River in northern California, northwest of Redding.. Natural-color satellite image from NASA's Terra satellite on August 31, 2014, during the time of the Happy Camp Fire, the state's largest fire that year.  The Tribe's proactive cultural use of fire also protects the Klamath River basin by reducing the availability of forest fuels—and thus reducing the risk of high-severity wildfire that can threaten people, their homes and businesses, and natural systems such as forests and wetlands near rivers and streams. Wildland systems in the Klamath River range have evolved alongside Karuk management practices for thousands of years. Tribal families continue to use traditional forest management techniques—including low-intensity prescribed burns—to cultivate the forest to become a more productive resource for food and cultural materials   to reduce the availability of forest fuels. Tribal programs support and expand upon their work. Tanoak acorns (xuntápan) are a staple Native food for many indigenous people and are also vital for numerous wildlife species. Additionally, the roots of tanoak trees support the growth of another important food, tanoak mushrooms. Tanoak (xunyêep) is very susceptible to high-intensity fire, but benefits from cultural burning that decreases tree and acorn pests and reduces competitive vegetation. Photo courtesy the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. Indigenous burning is increasingly recognized as a component of the ecosystem and a restoration technique. Fire is important for restoring grasslands for elk, managing for food sources such as tan and black oak acorns, maintaining quality basketry materials, and producing smoke that can shade the river for fish. Karuk fire regimes generate what is known as \"pyrodiversity\"—the biodiversity consequences of fire management—on the landscape by extending the burning season and shortening the intervals of fire return. The multitude of foods, materials, and other products that come from Karuk lands are evidence of the profound diversity of fire regimes that are required to maintain relationships with hundreds of animal, plant, and mushroom species. Beargrass—or panyúrar in Karuk—is an important species for basket weavers and regalia makers. The blades that grow the first year after a fire are considered best for basket weaving. Panyúrar can be stimulated by fire, and is fire-adapted in that it can sprout from rhizomes following fire or re-establish by seed. At the same time, panyúrar can be damaged by fires that burn too hot. Photo courtesy the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit.  Since European contact, non-native use and management of the region has severely impacted the Karuk people's access to cultural, ceremonial, and food resources. The region's changing climate has exacerbated these effects, and the Karuk are now experiencing a decline in the abundance of key species, including salmon, acorns, huckleberries, hazel, and willow. Natural disasters and hazards ranging from increasing frequency of high-severity wildfire to flooding and mudslides are on the rise—generating a range of negative human health outcomes for the Karuk people. In order to adapt to these and other ongoing challenges, the Karuk people are working to revitalize the Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) inextricably tied to their ability to physically apply resource management practices. Fire has been a primary tool in Karuk wildland management systems, and the Tribe maintains that the age-old tradition of prescribed burning holds the answer to climate adaptation planning in the Klamath River range. The Tribe has researched and published two reports concerning social and environmental climate changes and the long-term effects the Karuk people are facing with regard to knowledge sovereignty and the vulnerability of their TEK, supported by the 2015 Tribal Cooperative Landscape Conservation Program administered by the  .

Tribal leaders believe that it is possible to create a meaningful collaboration with the Forest Service, the Klamath National Forest, and the Six Rivers National Forest that upholds and strengthens tribal sovereignty and recognizes the legitimacy of the Karuk’s practical ability to carry out traditional management to restore the Klamath to a safe and productive state of health. In addition to the reports mentioned above, the Tribe has also undertaken and published the   (CVA), which addresses vulnerabilities to Karuk traditional foods and cultural use species, tribal program infrastructure, and management authority and political status that result from the increasing frequency of high-severity fire. The CVA makes the case that Karuk tribal knowledge and management principles regarding the use of fire can be utilized to reduce the likelihood of high-severity fires and thereby protect public, as well as tribal, trust resources.

In 2015, Nags Head initiated a comprehensive planning effort with direction from the Nags Head Board of Commissioners to explore and develop policy for sea level rise in their planning efforts. Mayor Robert Edwards summed up the motivation for the town to act: “We can’t ignore what is happening and what will continue to happen with sea level rise. It is imperative that as we plan for the future, we explore how to build, preserve infrastructure, and meet community needs in light of rising sea level.” Nags Head undertook a planning process designed to help the barrier island community become more resilient to storms, sea level rise, and other coastal hazards.  Photo courtesy Sarah Spiegler, NCSU.  Concurrently, the Town of Nags Head partnered with North Carolina Sea Grant to work with community members to better understand the town’s vulnerabilities to coastal hazards, including sea level rise. Dr. Jessica Whitehead, North Carolina Sea Grant Community Hazards Adaptations Specialist, led a team to implement the Vulnerability Consequences and Adaptation Planning Scenario (VCAPS) tool in an open public planning process. VCAPS is intended to engage community members and seek their input on potential coastal hazards, such as sea level rise. Approximately 60 people participated in a two-day community workshop. Starting with the VCAPS building blocks, participants communicated what they felt were hazards, potential consequences of the hazards, and potential public and private actions to adapt to or mitigate the issues identified.

It has opened my eyes to look at how we integrate all of this. Regardless of cause, we need to have it mapped and integrated.” Based on information and outcomes from the VCAPS process, the town established a Coastal Resiliency and Sea Level Rise Committee in 2016. This committee reviewed the VCAPS diagrams and worked to consolidate and prioritize over 160 possible adaptation actions suggested by the public into a report. The adaptation actions related to sea level rise and other coastal hazards were broken into four main categories: ocean management, estuarine shoreline management, stormwater management, and water (ground/surface) management.

But our planet has also been colder. Scientists may never know which period in our planet’s 4.54-billion-year history was the absolute coldest, but research has revealed a few contenders. All of these periods have been identified as ancient ice ages. Some of the coldest conditions struck over 2 billion years ago, after the rise of atmospheric oxygen. More deep freezes occurred between 750 and 600 million years ago. Although scientists debate exactly how extensive the ice coverage was during these times, the evidence indicates that ice reached sea level in equatorial regions. In the past few million years, glaciers have blanketed huge expanses of the Northern Hemisphere off and on. Though less severe than the near-global glaciations, the Pleistocene ice ages may have brought the coldest conditions in the last half a billion years. Some of the worst cold struck about 20,000 years ago. The   has been identified as a high ridge between Dome Argus and Dome Fuji in East Antarctica.

An ice age is a period of colder-than-usual global temperatures and bigger-than-usual glaciers and ice sheets. Ice ages don’t bring unrelenting cold. Instead, relatively warm periods intervene, so ice ages are a mix of advancing glaciers (glacials) and retreating glaciers (interglacials). Though relatively warm, interglacials are still part of a glacial epoch. How do scientists know ancient ice ages happened? Clearly, thermometers weren’t handy when continental-scale glaciers advanced toward the equator. The evidence for past ice ages comes instead from geology. Soon after the scientific discipline emerged in the early 19th century, geologists began finding clues left by ancient ice bodies. Glaciers, geologists realized, could leave giant scratch marks on bedrock and carry boulders to distant landscapes, often dropping those rocks at sea. Once the signs of glaciation were recognized for the Pleistocene Epoch (roughly 2.6 million to 11,000 years ago), geologists knew how to recognize them in older rocks. Combining the evidence for glaciation with the evidence for plate tectonics and continental drift has enabled geologists to identify glacial activity from hundreds of millions of years ago, when continents were configured very differently. After years of explaining geologic phenomena as the result of the Noachian flood, the 19th-century British geologist William Buckland accepted the evidence for glacial action. He became a proponent of the Ice Age theory. Image credit:  .  In all, scientists have identified upwards of a dozen ice ages in the geologic record, several of them in the last half a billion years. Some of the ice ages that struck even earlier were worse, probably the worst ice ages in our planet’s history. Among the earliest ice ages so far found in the geological record are the Huronian ice ages. At least one of them constituted what geologists call a Snowball Earth event, when the planet’s surface was entirely, or almost entirely, frozen. Interspersed with non-glacial periods, the ice ages occurred between 2.4 and 2.1 billion years ago, and probably resulted from changes in microscopic life. Paleontologists surmise that when microbial life arose on Earth over 3.5 billion years ago, microbes neither made nor needed oxygen. Instead, when life evolved, Earth’s atmosphere was very different from what we experience today. Although nitrogen levels may have been similar, other gases were much more—or much less—abundant. Carbon dioxide was anywhere from 10 to 2,500 times present levels, and methane may have been as much as 10,000 times higher than present levels. Atmospheric oxygen was virtually nonexistent. Before oxygen accumulated in Earth’s atmosphere, our planet probably looked not like a pale blue dot but instead like a pale orange dot. Image credit:  . Scientists debate when exactly microbes capable of carrying out photosynthesis and making oxygen as a byproduct first evolved. Estimates range from about 3.5 to 2.5 billion years ago. The earliest oxygen makers were probably ancestors of modern cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae. At first, the oxygen produced by these early photosynthesizers probably reacted with iron in the ocean, settling into layers of rusty sediment on the seafloor before starting to accumulate in the atmosphere. Some oxygen reacted with methane, converting it to carbon dioxide and water. Meanwhile, photosynthesizing microbe populations kept growing, consuming more carbon dioxide. Ancestors of modern cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) may have been the first oxygen producers on planet Earth, and ushered in significant changes in climate. CC license by Flickr user  . Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and methane is an even more potent greenhouse gas. As atmospheric concentrations of these greenhouse gases dropped, global temperatures plummeted, plunging the planet into a series of ice ages. The Huronian ice ages and non-glacial periods separating them likely lasted a total of 300 million years. Evidence suggests these glaciations reached equatorial regions at sea level. (Ice occurs in equatorial regions today, but only at high elevations.) Geologic evidence of these ice ages was first discovered in 1907, in glacial deposits near Lake Huron. Since then, geologists have discovered more evidence elsewhere in North America, as well as in South Africa, Western Australia, and northeastern Europe. Found near Whitefish Falls, Ontario, along the northern shore of Lake Huron, this dropstone landed in seafloor sediments under a floating glacier some 2.2 billion years ago. Image from  , photo by D.A. Lindsey, USGS. The rise of oxygen did more than freeze the planet. It also enabled the evolution of oxygen-breathing complex life, and formed Earth’s ozone layer, which helps protect life from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Brutal cold struck again during stretch of Earth’s history known as the Cryogenian Period. At least twice between 750 and 600 million years ago, Earth fell into a deep freeze. Because the Cryogenian Period events occurred during a longer geologic era known as the Neoproterozoic Era, the deep freezes are sometimes referred to as the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earths. Scientists continue to debate the causes of Neoproterozoic freezes and the subsequent thaws. Volcanoes may be the force that both pushed the planet into the glaciations and also pulled it out. About 750 million years ago, most continents were clustered around the equator. Within this continental mix, geologists have identified evidence of what they call a  . \"Large\" is an understatement—imagine a volcanically active area the size of a continent. Eruptions in this province could have cooled the planet in two ways. Evidence of the once-equatorial large igneous province that may have kickstarted the Cryogenian is preserved in Nunavut, Canada. Sills—intrusions of volcanic material into older rock layers—cut across older, sand-colored rock. The bands in the lighter rock result from the coastline rising after the glaciers that had weighed down the coast retreated. Image from  . When volcanoes release sulfur dioxide, the gas undergoes chemical reactions in the atmosphere to form highly reflective sulfates—particles that block out sunlight, like billions of tiny mirrors. Sulfates’ cooling potential is especially strong around Earth’s equator. Likewise, when volcanoes extrude large volumes of basalt, the rock weathering that follows can cool the planet. Over time, rain, wind, and chemical changes all eat away at volcanic rocks. Rainwater and groundwater percolating through rock can dissolve carbon dioxide, stripping it from the atmosphere and ultimately trapping it as carbonate minerals such as limestone. If global temperatures drop quickly enough, ice starts to build up, and ice’s ability to reflect most sunlight back into space cools the planet even further. Geologists have identified two glaciations during the Neoproterozoic: the Sturtian (about 720 to 660 million years ago) and the Marinoan (about 640 to 635 million years ago). Rock layers from these times show the most extensive evidence of extreme glaciations so far found in the geologic record. In between these deep freezes, Earth appears to have endured an equally remarkable  . This climate extreme, too, might be down to volcanic activity. Over the long term, volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide and the depletion of carbon dioxide by weathering of rocks can keep each other in check. But as ice enrobed most of the planet hundreds of millions of years ago, weathering probably slowed as conditions turned too cold for heavy precipitation. Meanwhile, increased sea ice would have reduced cyanobacteria’s access to sunlight at the ocean surface, reducing photosynthesis. Under its icy surface, Saturn’s frozen-ocean moon Enceladus may harbor liquid water and the ingredients necessary for life. If the most extreme ice ages in Earth history were true Snowball Earth events—with no open ocean—our planet may have looked like a supersized version of Enceladus. Image courtesy  . Volcanoes, however, kept cranking out carbon dioxide. With little rock-weathering or photosynthetic activity left to draw from the atmosphere, the greenhouse gas would have accumulated, leading to a gradual increase in global temperatures. Once conditions warmed enough to melt tropical ice, the temperature increase would have accelerated. After losing a significant amount of light-reflecting ice, the planet would have absorbed much more of the Sun’s energy. The subsequent big melt might have caused such dramatic, rapid weathering that it led to the second glaciation. As in the Huronian, glaciations of the Cryogenian Period reached sea level at the equator. But just how complete the Neoproterozoic ice coverage was—whether it was a   or a  —remains an area of active research. The rock record indicates that nothing as extensive as the Huronian and Cryogenian glaciations has happened in the last 500 million years, even though geologists have found evidence of several more ice ages. Although it has some competition from cold conditions occurring between 300 and 250 million years ago, the most significant ice age in the last half a billion years may be the most recent. Striking during the time period known as the Pleistocene Epoch, this ice age started about 2.6 million years ago and lasted until roughly 11,000 years ago. Like all the others, the most recent ice age brought a series of glacial advances and retreats. In fact, we are technically still in an ice age. We’re just living out our lives during an interglacial. All of human civilization—everything from the earliest scripts such as cuneiform to smartphones and tweets—has occurred within an interglacial.

Starting about 34 million years ago, the Antarctic Ice Sheet began to form. This might be down to South America separating from Antarctica, opening up the Drake Passage. Besides nauseating generations of ocean travelers, the Drake Passage opening created the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Circling the now-frozen continent, the current may have reduced the amount of ocean heat reaching Antarctica, enabling Antarctic ice to form and grow. Wind and waves make trips through the Drake Passage memorable. Its appearance due to plate tectonics maybe have contributed to the development of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. CC license by Flickr user  . Another land movement likely plunged the planet into its most recent ice age. The Isthmus of Panama, the land bridge between North and South America, formed about 4.5 million years ago. Prior to its formation, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans freely exchanged tropical waters. By cutting off that exchange and sending warm, salty ocean water northward, the isthmus increased precipitation at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Snow accumulated into glaciers and eventually into ice sheets. These massive, sunlight-deflecting ice bodies continued the planet’s cooling trend. Once Earth was cold enough for ice sheets to form, they waxed and waned over timescales of about 20,000 to 100,000 years, due partly to Milankovitch Cycles. These largely predictable changes in Earth’s orbit include eccentricity (changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun), obliquity (changes in the tilt of Earth’s axis), and precession (wobbling of Earth’s axis of rotation). They affect climate by changing the distribution of incoming solar energy on Earth’s surface. Roughly 20,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum of the Pleistocene Ice Age, ice spread over much of North America and Eurasia. (High-resolution without annotations  .) Image by Climate.gov based on data from the  , provided by  The latest ice age peaked about 20,000 years ago, when global temperatures were likely about 10°F (5°C) colder than today. At the Pleistocene Ice Age’s peak, massive ice sheets stretched over North America and Eurasia. We can thank these ice sheets and their associated melt events for the Great Lakes, Niagara Falls, and even the   in Washington and Oregon. Meltwater began spilling over the Niagara Escarpment some 12,000 years ago. Today, roughly 3,160 tons of water flows over Niagara Falls every second, a long-lasting legacy of the Pleistocene Ice Age.

The cycles have varying effects on global climate, some stronger than others. When atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeds 300 parts per million, the gas’s heat-retention ability is strong enough to overwhelm more subtle cycles. Atmospheric carbon dioxide now exceeds 400 parts per million, and because carbon dioxide is a long-lived gas, levels at least that high may persist for thousands of years. That doesn’t mean there will never be another ice age, but its onset may be delayed. Bekker, A. (2014). Huronian Glaciation. In   (pp. 1–8). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.  Catling, D. C., Zahnle, K. J.

Traducción al español por Ricardo Torrijo. Meteorólogo en el Centro Nacional de Predicción de AEMET. En realidad, desde diversos puntos de vista, es más difícil pronosticar el tiempo para dentro de dos semanas que pronosticar el clima con décadas de anticipación. Esto es así porque, en el primer caso, se trata de predecir condiciones exactas y, en el segundo caso, se trata de predecir el clima, es decir las condiciones promedio. Los modelos climáticos no intentan, por ejemplo, pronosticar la temperatura máxima diurna exacta en Chicago (Illinois) el 15 de agosto de 2035. Están tratando de pronosticar la temperatura máxima diurna promedio para el mes de agosto durante toda la década de 2030. Y mientras que las condiciones climáticas exactas en un lugar determinado pueden cambiar bruscamente de un momento a otro, el clima promedio cambia mucho menos de un año a otro o incluso de una década a otra. La diferencia en la escala de tiempo significa que nuestra capacidad para predecir el clima futuro no depende de nuestra capacidad para predecir el clima de la próxima semana.

Observed and anticipated increases in greenhouse gas emissions from China and other countries don’t let Americans off the hook for reducing emissions. From a purely physical perspective, any reduction in emissions helps minimize future temperature increases. From the perspective of fairness, the United States has released more heat-trapping gases to date than either China or India, the world’s two most populous countries. Carbon dioxide is a long-lived greenhouse gas that can linger in Earth’s atmosphere for thousands of years. Consequently, the United States bears more responsibility for the amount of warming that has occurred so far and will persist for millennia.  Global carbon emissions began to rise measurably in the mid-nineteenth century. Total U.S. emissions still remained above China’s and India’s through 2021. Credit: Our World in Data The United States, along with close to 200 other countries, is a party to the  . The agreement aims to limit “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C [3.6 ˚F] above pre-industrial levels.” Participating nations also agree to try “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C [2.7 ˚F] above pre-industrial levels.” To meet these goals, humans can emit only so much more carbon dioxide, whether through fossil fuel burning, cement production, or land use change. Just as a household working with limited financial resources must adhere to a financial budget, nations trying to limit further warming must collectively adhere to a carbon budget. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons—one gigaton is a billion metric tons—per year in the mid-20  century before skyrocketing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century.

CO  emissions data from   and the  .  In  —part of its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released estimates of the allowable carbon emissions from the start of 2020. To have a 50 percent chance of capping global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the group estimated that humanity should limit emissions to no more than 500 billion metric tons. For a 50 percent chance of capping global warming at 2.0°C above pre-industrial levels, humans should limit emissions to 1,350 billion metric tons. To raise the odds of hitting those targets, we would have to emit even less.  Unfortunately, most of the estimated global carbon budget for the 1.5°C target has been spent. The AR6 concluded that humans had already burned through about four-fifths of the budget. In November 2022, the   of the allowable carbon emissions to limit further warming. Taking into account the continued emissions since the IPCC AR6 publication, the Global Carbon Project estimated that maintaining a 50 percent chance of meeting the 1.5°C target meant limiting future emissions to 380 billion metric tons. Maintaining a 50 percent chance of meeting the 2°C target meant limiting future emissions to 1,230 billion metric tons. Each pie chart shows how much carbon dioxide the world has already added to the atmosphere through 2022 (gray) and how much additional carbon dioxide we can add (orange) if we want at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to (left to right) 1.5, 1.7, or 2.0 degrees Celsius (2.7, 3, or 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial global average temperature. Most of what we can emit and still keep temperatures below these amounts has already been released. Image provided by the Global Carbon Project. Used under a Creative Commons license. Some countries have spent much more of the budget than others. The Industrial Revolution began in the mid-eighteenth century, and global carbon dioxide emissions began rising measurably about a century later. Western Europe industrialized early, as did parts of the United States and Canada. Further boosting carbon emissions throughout the nineteenth century, waves of European settlers cleared forest for farmland in the United States and Canada. By comparison, China and India have been relative latecomers to industrialization, although China is ramping up quickly. Even so, both countries have remained behind the United States in per person emissions and total cumulative emissions. In fact, at China’s 2021 rate of 11.47 gigatons per year, it would take roughly 15 years to match the U.S. historical contribution. At India’s 2021 rate of 2.71 gigatons per year, it would take about 135 years to catch up to the United States. Annual carbon dioxide emissions from selected developed and developing countries from 1850-2021. Until the start of the new millennium in 2000, the United States (black line) emitted more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year than any other country, including all the countries of the European Union combined.(orange line). Since the mid-2000s, China's annual emissions (red line) have been the world's largest. Graph from  , based on data from the Global Carbon Project. In 1973, U.S. per capita carbon dioxide emissions were 20 times those of China’s and 66 times those of India’s. By the year 2000, when many U.S. policymakers and consumers were aware of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, U.S. per person emissions had dropped to just over 21 metric tons per year, while China’s and India’s had risen to 2.9 and 0.9 respectively. That meant U.S. per person emissions were seven times those of China’s and 23 times those of India’s. Since then, the United States' per person emission rate has continued to drop, but the country's 2021 per person carbon dioxide emissions were still nearly twice as large as China's and nearly 8 times as large as India's. (Explore these and other comparisons through the interactive charts and maps at the excellent   site.) The United States lowered per capita carbon dioxide emissions starting in the 1970s, but still led both China and India through 2021. Credit: Our World in Data Furthermore, national emissions are not wholly independent of each other. Much of China’s rising emissions are related to manufacturing, with many of the resulting products increasingly purchased by American consumers. The United States imported $450.4 billion worth of goods from China in 2020 alone, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. (  allows users to view emissions adjusted by production and consumption of imported and exported goods.) If we agree to the premise that each country is entitled to use up a chunk of the remaining carbon budget that’s proportional to its population, the United States has nothing left to spend. In fact, the United States has overspent, according to a  .  The study tallied historical emissions by country, divided each nation’s carbon budget by world population to arrive at a per person carbon budget, then multiplied the per person budget by national population. By this measure, the United States has overspent its carbon budget by roughly 346 billion metric tons.   found that Russia, the European Union, and the world’s highest per person emitters at present (Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait) have also exceeded their carbon budgets.  The United States’ big population partially contributes to national carbon overspending, but keep in mind that China and India each have roughly four times the U.S. population. As of 2021, according to  , the United States population was 337 million while China’s was 1.43 billion and India’s was 1.41 billion. In short, the United States bears a greater share of the responsibility for current conditions—on both a national and per-person level. The world can only emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide if we want a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to no more than 2°C (3.6 ˚F) above pre-industrial temperatures. ( ) The location of the dots indicates how much carbon dioxide a country has already emitted (vertical axis, in billions of metric tons) versus its remaining population-based budget (horizontal axis). The United States, Brazil, Russia, and the European Union plus the United Kingdom (EU28) are all above the red diagonal line, meaning they have already \"overspent.\" China and India are below the line, which means they have emitted less carbon dioxide to date than they would be allowed based on their population. ( ) Red and gray bars compare how much a country has already emitted (red) and how much of its budget remains (gray). U.S. emissions to date dwarf its remaining national budget.

Rising emissions from China and India could eventually overshadow total U.S. emissions, and could easily push global warming past the 1.5°C goal, and even past the 2°C goal. This looming possibility might make U.S. emission reductions seem pointless, but they are not. If heat-trapping emissions continue, where they originate won’t matter nearly as much as how big they are and how long they continue.

Those emissions will continue to drive global warming. Combined with the contribution that past U.S. emissions have made to warming to date, any future U.S. emissions will undermine progress to stop global warming.  Environmental Protection Agency.  .

SRM is not considered a substitute for climate mitigation efforts, which include decarbonization and greenhouse gas emission cuts. Research into the viability and effectiveness of SRM methods and potential unintended consequences provide a foundation for decisions regarding the implementation of SRM.   Proposed SRM methods involve the use of aerosols (small particles) or other materials to increase the reflectivity of the atmosphere, clouds, or Earth’s surface. These methods have the potential to lower surface temperatures more quickly than carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods and reduce some risks posed by climate change, while posing other risks still to be understood.   The single largest driver of climate change in the industrial era has been human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO ), a long-lived   (GHG).   SRM research is being conducted as a response to growing concerns that the pace of CO  emissions reductions and CDR technology development is not sufficient to avoid severe impacts of climate change in the next decades. Research into the viability and effectiveness of SRM methods and potential unintended consequences provide a foundation for decisions regarding the implementation of SRM.   By contrast, GHGs warm surface temperatures by trapping a portion of outgoing terrestrial radiation that would otherwise be emitted into space. SRM methods reduce surface warming without addressing the fundamental cause—rising levels of atmospheric GHGs—and thus do not offset all of the impacts of carbon emissions. based on a combination of projected feasibility and estimated cost. To date, far less research has been performed on other proposed methods for modifying Earth’s radiation budget     Figure 1.  Proposed methods for modifying Earth’s radiation budget, including SRM methods and cirrus cloud thinning. : a strategy for increasing the number of small reflective aerosols in the stratosphere to increase the reflection of incoming sunlight.  : a strategy for adding aerosol to the lower atmosphere over ocean regions to increase the reflectivity of low-lying marine clouds.   a strategy for modifying the properties of high altitude ice clouds to increase the transmission of outgoing terrestrial radiation to space.  increasing the reflectivity of surfaces through, for example, white roofs or land-cover changes. proposed methods have primarily considered large “mirrors” in space to reflect sunlight. either by direct injection or by injection of a precursor gas (such as sulfur dioxide, SO ) that would subsequently react in the stratosphere to form aerosols. Proposed aerosol types include sulfate, calcium carbonate, and diamond dust.   by increasing the number of small cloud droplets. SRM research centers on developing and studying a range of potential future scenarios that combine emissions reductions, CDR, and SRM to varying degrees and over varying timescales. In one such scenario, commonly called “peak-shaving” (illustrated in  , SRM would be implemented as a temporary method alongside strong GHG emission cuts and aggressive CDR to stabilize global temperatures and offset some of the most negative impacts of climate change. Figure 2.  Schematic diagram representing the concept of peak-shaving. Different lines illustrate the global mean temperatures for future scenarios. Blue arrows represent the relative magnitude of the temperature impact of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). Side effects of SRM are driven by complex chemical, radiative, and dynamical interactions, such as changes to the hydrologic cycle and clouds, or effects on ecosystems, agricultural production, and the carbon cycle. Additional   by SAI and alterations to the El Niño Southern Oscillation by MCB are also possible. The potential risks and benefits to human health and well-being and to ecosystems from SRM need to be evaluated and assessed relative to those associated with plausible trajectories of ongoing climate change without SRM (i.e., using risk vs. risk analysis). Current understanding of risks and benefits is limited by uncertainties in the observations and modeling tools used to examine SRM impacts.  GHG-induced warming and SRM-induced cooling are different physical mechanisms; therefore,   In fact, effects of climate change on regional weather patterns will not be fully mitigated by SRM. Some regions could experience cooler or wetter conditions, and others warmer or drier conditions, compared to a climate without SRM. In addition,   will persist unabated if GHG emissions continue.   Recent studies on SRM indicate that some of the negative impacts can be reduced through design of an optimal injection strategy (i.e. location, magnitude, and timing of injection).   These efforts have demonstrated the basic efficacy of SRM for cooling Earth’s surface temperatures, while also identifying a number of gaps and uncertainties in our current understanding, as well as potential unintended outcomes. Climate models differ in simulating large-scale aerosol climate effects, including on surface temperatures, due to variations in how aerosol processes, atmospheric transport and mixing, and physics are represented. There remain large uncertainties as to the changes in large scale circulation, regional climate, air quality, and weather, associated with SRM. Research on low-level clouds has also revealed  , so the net climate effect of injecting aerosols into the lower atmosphere for MCB is difficult to project.  A fundamental challenge of SRM is the technological requirement to implement any strategy at the scale required to achieve appreciable global cooling. Both SAI and MCB would require development of reliable methods for producing aerosols of a specific size and uniformity, in addition to the platforms/vehicles needed for deployment (e.g., ships, high altitude aircraft/balloons).  Aerosols are removed from the atmosphere by natural processes on timescales of a few days in the troposphere and a few years in the stratosphere. An SRM strategy like peak-shaving would require ongoing deployment until such time that the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs are sufficiently reduced. Ceasing actions abruptly when injections are large could lead to a more rapid climate change (termination shock) than would have occurred in the absence of SRM. SRM also raises concerns of intergenerational equity by committing future generations to continue on a path they did not choose.  Climate change raises geopolitical risks, and SRM deployment could also add significant geopolitical risks. Implementing SRM may positively impact some locations and negatively impact others. This uneven distribution of benefits and negative consequences introduces potentially significant justice and geopolitical concerns. Currently, no universally accepted governance framework provides oversight for SRM research or implementation. Substantial knowledge gaps and uncertainties exist in many critical areas of SRM research, particularly related to the social sciences.  All activities occur within existing authorizations for Federal science agencies. The US Government is not engaged in any form of outdoor testing or deployment of SRM techniques and does not condone or endorse SRM deployment. Any activities intending to modify weather or Earth’s solar radiation (i.e., SRM) are required to be reported to NOAA under the  . NOAA keeps track of the reports submitted, and maintains them for public access in the NOAA Library.  NOAA conducts observations and modeling research on the climate system and the detailed atmospheric and oceanic processes that drive it. Researching how SRM may change the climate system is part of NOAA’s mission. NOAA observations provide important constraints on and verification of NOAA modeling and projection capabilities, which, in turn, enable the exploration of future climate scenarios that allow for examining and understanding impacts, options, and tradeoffs. Following a Congressional directive implemented in 2020, NOAA is leading the ERB program—a multi-year research program to investigate natural and human activities (e.g., volcanoes, wildfire pyrocumulous, space industry emissions, ship tracks, and SRM) that might alter the composition and reflectivity of the atmosphere.  The ERB program has funded research projects relevant to SRM both within NOAA labs and with external collaborators. These projects include: model development, model studies of SRM efficacy and impacts, laboratory studies of stratospheric aerosol materials, novel instrument development, observations of stratospheric aerosol using  , and   (UAS) measurements of aerosol-cloud interactions in marine clouds. The   (Stratospheric Aerosol processes, Budget and Radiative Effects) project, ERB’s flagship stratospheric measurement effort, is a multi-year airborne research campaign using high altitude research aircraft to collect the detailed observations of stratospheric composition and chemistry necessary for improving chemistry–climate models and narrowing the uncertainty in model projections of SAI impacts.  Help us improve our content"},

The temperature outlook favors well above   across the central and eastern parts of the nation, as well as in northern Alaska. The precipitation outlook favors well above   in the Pacific Northwest, across parts of the central U.S., and in southern Alaska, with below-average precipitation only favored right along the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine and in extreme southern Louisiana.

Darker colors mean  , not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average November.  or means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total November precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only   available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.  If you decide to keep reading (and I hope you do), I’ll provide more specific information about the outlooks and what they are based on, discuss the changes in drought during October, and present the drought outlook for November. Finally, my ever-present reminder: the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps provide information about the   outcome, but other outcomes are also possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found  . The updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC’s own 6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month included longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), and the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. Although  , expectations that it will soon played a small role in the November outlooks. The   has remained active, but its typical impacts on the U.S. (cool conditions in the East) are out of phase with model guidance later in the month (which predicts above-average temperatures), so the main impact from the MJO was to moderate the model-based probabilities. The November temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across all of the central and eastern parts of the nation and in northern Alaska. (  means “in the warmest third of all Novembers in the recent climate record.”) No parts of the Lower 48 states are favored to have a colder-than-average month, although temperatures in southern Alaska are slightly favored to be below average, and with e  odds (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) found in the western part of the country. The greatest odds for a warmer-than-average November are found in the eastern parts of the nation, with probabilities exceeding 50%. These probabilities might have been even higher, as official outlooks during all periods (WPC’s Week-1, and CPC’s Week-2 and Week 3-4) favor above-average temperatures. However,   in the longer term for this region, injecting some uncertainty into the longer-range outlook. Likewise, the equal chance forecast in the West is somewhat dependent on typical impacts in that area when the MJO is \"upstream\" in the Pacific. Those favor average to above-average temperatures, while the official longer-range outlooks have a slight tilt in the odds toward below-average temperatures, continuing expectations for below-average temperatures expected during the beginning of the month. Across Alaska, trends favor above-average temperatures along the northern coast, while La Niña favors cooler-than-average temperatures along the southern Alaskan mainland and panhandle. However, November looks to begin above average in southern Alaska, so probabilities for below-normal temperatures for the month are quite modest. The precipitation outlook for November favors above-average rainfall across parts of the central U.S., in the Pacific Northwest, and in southern Alaska. The highest odds extend from the Southern Plains to the Great Lakes (greater than 50%), where forecasts for the first week of the month predict 2-5 inches of rain. Early month activity and the developing La Niña favor above-normal precipitation across the Pacific Northwest and southern portions of Alaska, including the Alaskan Panhandle. Below-average rainfall is only slightly favored along parts of the Eastern Seaboard and in extreme southern Louisiana. A dry start to the month along the East Coast, combined with Week-2 and Week 3-4 outlooks of near or below-average precipitation is enough to favor below-average precipitation from North Carolina to Maine. However, probabilities are low with uncertainty high, as the Madden-Julian Oscillation would favor troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) across the middle of the nation, potentially bringing moisture northward and eastward during the middle and latter parts of the month. Drought conditions across the contiguous United States as of October 29, 2024. Pockets of extreme (red) and exceptional (dark red) drought were present in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Ohio, and West Virginia. Many locations were at or near record dryness across the country. For the lower 48, there has not been this much drought since December 2022. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by the  .  After one of the driest months the United States has ever seen, it should come as no surprise that the amount of drought across the contiguous United States significantly increased during October. Drought coverage increased about 20% during the month, with around 54% of the nation experiencing some level of drought at the end of the month. In addition, just over 87% of the nation is now at least abnormally dry, the largest coverage ever in the history of the U. S. Drought Monitor dating back to 2000. Although the percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing   and   drought) more than doubled to 6.5%, that amount is still fairly low when compared to the amount of the country currently in drought. Regionally, drought degradation was quite prevalent across most of the country with only a very few small regions seeing just a one-class improvement. The largest negative changes were on the order of 2-3 classes, mainly in the middle of the country, although there was some 2-class degradation along parts of the East Coast. Out West, drought changes were almost entirely one class, as rainfall deficits were more modest, as October is not normally a particularly wet month.  U.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in November 2024. Several new areas of drought are likely to develop (yellow) across portions of the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. Existing drought in those areas, the West, and Ohio Valley are likely to continue or worsen (brown). Existing drought from Texas northward to the Great Lakes is expected to improve by at least 1 category (tan) or end (green). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See   for Alaska and Hawaii. With above-average precipitation favored throughout the middle of the nation, drought improvement with some drought removal is predicted from Texas northward to the Great Lakes. However, improvement was limited only to those areas where the heaviest rainfall is forecast during early November. Broad-scale drought persistence is expected for most of the West. Improvement, at least in the Pacific Northwest, becomes more likely beyond the end of November, as indicated in the seasonal drought outlook valid through the end of January. Based on precipitation deficits dating back to September, declining soil moisture, and continued dry weather through at least the first part of November, drought persistence and development are forecast for parts of the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and in the Northeast.

Now, after many engineering developments and an orange paint job, Jenkins’ design autonomously sails the sea gathering ecologic, oceanic, and atmospheric data in the  . The public-private partnership between NOAA and Saildrone Inc., Jenkins’ startup company, began in 2014 when Chris Meinig of   (PMEL) met Jenkins. Meinig saw the saildrone’s potential for cost-effectively enhancing NOAA’s existing ocean-monitoring fleet of buoys, ships, and autonomous vehicles. Working together with Saildrone Inc., Meinig and his PMEL and   colleagues customized the saildrones by adding sensors to meet NOAA’s diverse data collecting needs. The 20-foot tall drones now carry over 200 pounds of instruments. Saildrones set sail. Photo courtesy of Saildrone Inc., via  “It’s a single platform that can measure interdisciplinary aspects. You not only get the ocean physics, you also get biogeochemistry and CO , or even  , and an understanding of the critters in the water,” said Meinig. These environmentally friendly saildrones—solar panels power the sensors, and wind propels the drones—can sail for months at a time and cover thousands of miles while constantly relaying data via satellite to onshore operators. Operators can also make course adjustments to further investigate any areas of interest. This adaptive capability allows saildrones to follow   as they hunt for food or zig-zag across oceanic eddies or fronts—capabilities traditional monitoring methods don’t possess. “You’re able to see phenomena you couldn’t see before,” said Meinig. The saildrone recovery crew in front of three saildrones in Dutch Harbor, AK. Photo courtesy of Saildrone Inc., via  . During a mission  , PMEL and Fisheries researchers sent saildrones to the rough waters of the Bering Sea and the Arctic. They searched for tagged fur seals, carried out fish surveys, and studied ocean-atmosphere interactions and gas flux. Traditional Arctic monitoring is challenged by high costs and a short ice-free window of opportunity for vessels to sail north, but thanks to their renewable power supply, saildrones have more endurance and can venture farther than any vessel—with no risk to human passengers. “We get a much more integrated picture of what’s happening during the ice-free season up there relative to a ship, which gives you just a single snapshot in time,” said Jessica Cross, a NOAA PMEL oceanographer. In addition to the freedom to range wherever scientists send them, saildrones have also provided data that is so detailed that Cross and other researchers suspected the devices were malfunctioning. Once, she says, the drones observed such a large increase in carbon dioxide concentration over such a small area of ocean that they were surprised when a nearby research vessel was able to verify the signal. Between July and September of 2017 saildrones cruised past Alaska and into the Arctic, collecting observations of the difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO ) in the ocean versus the atmosphere. Positive numbers (purple) indicate that carbon dioxide pressure was higher in the ocean than the atmosphere, which favors release of carbon dioxide. Negative values mean that the carbon dioxide pressure was lower in the ocean than the atmosphere, so conditions would have favored carbon uptake. The carbon dioxide partial pressure values have been normalized with respect to temperature. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from NOAA PMEL. “It’s really unprecedented,” said Cross. “Saildrones are collecting some extremely high-resolution data. And we think, that can’t be right, the ocean doesn’t work that way. And then you go back and reprocess that data and find out what you thought was a glitch was a real feature.” A few months after the Arctic mission launched, PMEL dispatched sail drones to the tropical Pacific to study how the atmosphere and ocean exchange carbon dioxide. The drones explored a region about 1,500 miles off the coast of Central America, thought to be the largest natural source of oceanic CO  to the atmosphere. Saildrones’ adaptive capability could better track year-to-year changes in oceanic CO  within the tropical Pacific, explained NOAA PMEL oceanographer Adrienne Sutton. The area is currently home to an observing system called the   Array, a fleet of about 70 buoys moored throughout the tropical Pacific. The buoys measure changes in ocean temperature and monitor El Niño, but so far researchers have attached carbon dioxide sensors to only a few.  “I think those are two things that are most exciting: Saildrones can fill in those gaps—not to mention huge gaps that exist in the southern hemisphere—and also provide adaptive sampling, so you can measure events as they are evolving. Those are two really powerful, new capabilities that we haven’t had,” said Sutton. Saildrone’s high-resolution data can also provide new ways for researchers to track El Niño in the tropical Pacific. Due to TAO’s spread-out design of stationary buoys, the warm and cold water fronts that reflect El Niño and La Niña appear broad with smeared edges. Saildrones revealed a sharper image. “We are surprised by how abrupt these fronts are,” said Meghan Cronin, an oceanographer at NOAA PMEL. “Some of these warm water fronts are so sharp that the ocean is changing a whole degree in temperature over less than a kilometer,” according to their preliminary data. There’s no way that Cronin or other researchers would see that from satellites or buoys. According to our calculations, a drone departed from Alameda, CA and sailed 8,324 miles over an 8-month period from September 2017 to April 2018. The data it collected on sea surface temperatures surprised NOAA researchers by revealing how abruptly sea surface temperatures change over short distances. NOAA Climate.gov map based on data from NOAA PMEL. Despite saildrones performing exceptionally well so far, it’s not time to dock research vessels, decommission buoys, or recall the fleet of   that patrol the global ocean. Saildrones can stay out to sea for months at a time in a cost-efficient manner, but research vessels remain the most powerful tool in NOAA’s fleet because of their ability to host a diverse payload of sensors, equipment, and scientists. Buoys may be moored in one location, but they provide very detailed data as well as stable time series that are crucial for detecting change. Robotic floats, such as the  , can’t accommodate CO  sensors, but they can sink below the surface to measure temperature and salinity in the deep ocean. Saildrones are an exciting emerging technology, but PMEL researchers are still verifying the data they collect and brainstorming how best for NOAA to incorporate them into its ocean-monitoring fleet. “By combining all these [devices] together, you get a great picture of what’s happening at the surface with the saildrone, you get this really detailed and spatially broad snapshot with the ship, and then you get these nice long time series with the buoys. Having all three of those together enables us to paint a much more complete picture of the system than we’ve been able to before,” said Cross. Three saildrones are docked next to a larger ship and ready to launch. Photo courtesy of Saildrone Inc., via  . After every mission, the team at PMEL and the drone engineers learn more about how to improve saildrones to make them more effective and durable. Because as Meinig said, “the ocean is always trying to crush what you put out there.” When the drones sailed to the tropical Pacific, Saildrone Inc. found that the small sails that handled the extreme weather of the Bering Sea didn’t provide enough power for the drones to easily navigate through the region’s low winds and strong currents. Instead, they’d need to build a separate model with a larger sail to generate more power. The buildup of algae and other organisms on the drones’ hull slowed them down, a problem they hope a new anti-biofouling coating will fix. They even had a marine hitchhiker. Once, when the drone was sailing north to the Arctic, a young spotted seal decided it looked like a nice resting place, so it hauled itself out onto the drone for two days, causing the drone to behave erratically.   A young Spotted Seal hitches a ride on a sailing drone in the Arctic. Photo courtesy of Saildrone Inc., via  . At this point, researchers and engineers have tweaked the drones and sampling protocols enough that saildrones are now approaching an operational stage that will allow other outside agencies, institutions, or universities to use them for their own purposes. And in regards to saildrones at NOAA’s PMEL, a new research season is about to start, with saildrones heading back to the tropical Pacific and the Arctic. “We’re going to continue to ramp up the challenge to push ourselves to do good work,” said Cross.  Help us improve our content"},

But how do NOAA and partner scientists gather data on such a vast environment?  One big way is with buoys, ocean observing platforms that help scientists monitor the global ocean — including in remote, hard-to-reach areas. Some of these buoys float along the ocean surface, gathering data as they   (sometimes even into the paths of hurricanes!). Some, meanwhile, are  , collecting data in the same region and helping scientists observe changes over several years or decades. In honor of Ocean Month, we’re highlighting five buoys that help NOAA scientists monitor and understand the ocean (and the Great Lakes, too!). NOAA’s biophysical mooring site 2—nicknamed “ ”—is one tough buoy. Since 1995, Peggy has been taking year-round measurements of temperature, salt content, nitrate, chlorophyll and currents in the remote Bering Sea. Data collected by Peggy has been used by scientists to study the cold pool and loss of sea ice in the Bering Sea, a region that supports large marine mammal and bird populations and some of the most profitable and sustainable commercial fisheries in the United States. Many Bering Sea fish populations, including the commercially valuable Alaska pollock, thrive best when bottom waters remain cold throughout the summer. Located in the southeastern Bering Sea, NOAA's M2 moored buoy—nicknamed \"Peggy\"—records water temperatures and other physical and biological data from the surface to the floor of the coastal shelf, giving scientists an important glimpse into the status of the Bering Sea's summer cold pool. This graph shows Peggy's observations of water temperatures near the sea floor (depths of 60 meters, or 197 feet) from 2010 to mid-May 2021. In the early part of the 2010 decade, sub-zero winter temperatures and cooler summers were common. Recent years have been much warmer. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on NOAA buoy data from Shaun Bell. Background image from NOAA/NASA Suomi NPP satellite on February 27, 2021, via  . Peggy is named for Peggy Dyson, who for 25 years, from her home in Kodiak, Alaska, reported the weather, family messages, and sometimes even paid bills for the mariners of the North Pacific Ocean.  Peggy isn’t the only moored buoy gathering key ocean data in remote environments—  from NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Lab.  The ocean absorbs about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) that is released in the atmosphere, and as that CO2 is absorbed, it changes the pH of the ocean.   poses a big risk to marine life — as waters become more acidic, corals have a harder time building their skeletons, oysters and other shellfish have a harder time building their shells, and fish can experience worrisome behavioral changes.

There are currently 50 of these buoys worldwide, each of which is deployed either over a coral reef, in the open ocean, or in a coastal region. These buoys gather long-term data on carbon dioxide in the ocean, allowing scientists to track how ocean acidification is progressing in different regions. One of these buoys is deployed at   a coral reef within the   off of  , Florida  Scientists chose   Rocks because of its important coral habitat, which has managed to stay relatively healthy compared to reefs farther offshore. Scientists have been studying why these inshore patch reefs like   Rocks have been more resilient to environmental stressors, including coral disease, coral bleaching, and overfishing — and the MAPCO2 buoy helps in that effort. This buoy measures the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in seawater, temperature, salinity, and pH every three hours. The data is  . In the Cheeca Rocks area of the Florida Keys, NOAA has deployed a buoy to keep tabs on water chemistry. Among other things, the buoy records the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the water (pCO2, light brown line) and the pH (dark brown line), which indicates the seawater's acidity. Some of the reefs at Cheeca Rocks seem more resilient to heat stress and ocean acidification than others, and NOAA hopes that detailed observations coupled with high-resolution images (such as the one in the background) will help them understand why. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on MAPCO  data provided by Nicole Besemer.  Buoys aren’t just for the ocean! NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Laboratory ( ) deploys buoys on the Great Lakes every spring. These 16   gather a range of atmospheric and water data in the Great Lakes, including wave height, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, and water temperature. Data collected by   buoys can help water managers keep tabs on water safety, warning of potential hypoxic (low-oxygen) events, which can affect drinking water quality. The   buoys gather can help the public decide whether to hit the water for a day of boating or fishing, and the long-term data helps resource managers, educators, and researchers better understand Great Lakes health. If you’re planning a day out on the Great Lakes, you can even  to get information on current wind speeds, water temperature, air temperature and more.

NOAA works with the Great Lakes Observing System ( ), and  , a private engineering firm, to build monitoring capacity in central Lake Erie. One   buoy, for instance,  on oxygen levels near a water intake in Cleveland, data that’s then incorporated into NOAA models and allows scientists to alert water managers that this low-oxygen water -- which can be dangerous -- is too close to drinking water intakes. Monsoons are seasonal shifts in wind that can cause heavy rain or droughts in regions from the tropics to the  . A third of the world population depends on monsoon-driven rainfall for producing crops, so being able to understand and predict monsoons is critical to these populations — especially populations in India, which is primarily impacted by monsoons.

(right) Monthly rainfall (top), wind (middle), and sea surface temperature (bottom) from a RAMA buoy moored at 15 degrees North, 90 degrees East, in the Indian Ocean from late 2020 through mid-2021. These simultaneous observations of the upper ocean and the atmosphere allow us to better understand how they interact to produce the weather and climate, including the arrival and departure of the wet season of the Indian Monsoon, which provides the lion's share of water for crops in India and many other countries around the Indian Ocean rim.

RAMA is part of the  , which also includes buoy arrays in the Pacific ( ) and Atlantic ( ) Oceans. RAMA is the newest array of the three, initiated in 2004 to better study the traditionally data-sparse Indian Ocean. RAMA has since grown through the formation of NOAA partnerships with Indonesia and India, and with contributions by Japan, China, and the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem program. RAMA buoys collect data on a range of atmospheric and oceanic variables, including ocean temperature, salinity, currents, wind, sea level air pressure and humidity. In 2018 India's Ministry of Earth Sciences   their Ocean Moored Buoy Network for the Northern Indian Ocean would provide open access data to the new Indian Ocean RAMA-OMNI moored buoy array - meaning even more ocean data is now shared freely among researchers, helping improve the accuracy of forecasts.  A DART—short for Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis—buoy floating on the ocean surface.

In this graph of minute-by-minute data from May 21, 2021, the squiggles show rapid increases and decreases in the height of the water column a sign of a possible seismic event that could trigger a tsunami. Not all earthquakes and water column disturbances produce tsunamis. Data from DART buoys is sent via satellite to experts who model the disturbance's likely impact on the ocean and decide whether a tsunami warning needs to be issued. Image by NOAA Climate.gov, based on photo and data from the National Buoy Data Center. DART buoys are located strategically throughout the ocean — often close to locations where earthquakes that generate tsunamis are likely to happen - and gather key data on sea surface levels as a tsunami travels past them. After a tsunami is generated by an earthquake, a sensor located at the ocean floor communicates with the DART buoy on the surface, sending info about the magnitude of the tsunami wave directly to the Tsunami Warning Centers. The centers then create an estimate of where the tsunami was generated to produce a more accurate tsunami forecast and provide communities with the appropriate alert level (either a Watch, Advisory or Warning). NOAA’s buoys are amazing tools — but they aren’t the only tools we use to monitor the ocean!

In addition, significant heat waves were observed both in the West (early in the month), and then in the central and eastern parts of the country during the second half of the month. As is often seen during hot summer months, rainfall was below normal across much of the western and eastern parts of the nation, with above-average precipitation falling only in parts of the upper Midwest and southern Plains. With summer off to a very hot start, will temperatures remain above-average or will we see a break from the heat? After a fairly dry June, will drought become a significant problem across the country? Here’s the outlook for July from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC).

And my look at the upcoming month wouldn’t be complete without my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the   outcome, but other outcomes are still possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found The updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC’s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), and products derived from these models. With  , El Niño was not a factor in the July outlooks. Finally, observed soil moisture was considered for these outlooks, as extremes in   and precipitation during the summer. The July temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across almost the entire contiguous United States. (  means “in the warmest third of all Julys in the recent climate record.”) The exception is for parts of the northern Midwest from western Michigan extending westward to eastern North and South Dakota, where   odds are found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average). A large region of the nation has very high odds for the heat to continue, with probabilities exceeding 60% in large parts of the western, southern, and eastern parts of the country, and odds exceeding 70% in the Great Basin and parts of the Southwest and Intermountain West. Underpinning this monthly outlook is the fact that most of the western, southern, and eastern parts of the country are favored to have above-normal temperatures during both the short term (WPC Week-1 forecasts) and CPC longer-term (Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 outlooks). The CPC outlooks favor above-average temperatures over the entire nation. Ridging (jet stream shifted north of normal) is predicted along the West Coast early in the month, before it moves inland later in the month, becoming centered over the Northern Rockies. Ridging is also predicted to persist throughout much of the month over the East, leading to higher confidence of heat there as well. The early part of July looks to be cooler-than-average in parts of the Northern Plains and upper Great Lakes, which could persist into Week-2. Thereafter, above-average temperatures are favored, but the moderate start to the month provides enough uncertainty that there is no tilt in the odds for the month as a whole. The precipitation outlook has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-“equal chances” forecast, but the probabilities (and therefore confidence) are fairly modest, certainly much lower than the probabilities seen in the temperature outlook. Below-average precipitation is favored in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, as the previously mentioned strong ridging favored throughout most of the month should limit precipitation at the same time it’s bringing heat. The potential ridging over this region results in the largest probabilities in the precipitation outlook, exceeding 50% in the Pacific Northwest. Odds also favor below-average rainfall in parts of the southern and central Plains, where current soil moisture anomalies are below-normal, and models predict limited moisture transport into the region throughout the month. In contrast, probabilities for rainfall lean toward above average in the Upper Mississippi Valley, the southern borders of New Mexico and Arizona, and along the Gulf Coast, Florida, and along the East Coast. Expected rainfall early in the month contributes to the outlook in the Desert Southwest and in the Upper Mississippi Valley, while the slight tilt toward above-normal precipitation along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts is a nod toward   and potential  .  After a generally hot and dry month of June, it should come as no surprise that the amount of drought increased during the month across the continuous United States, from about 12.5% at the end of May to more than 16%. What’s more concerning, however, is that the amount of the country in the DO category (abnormally dry) increased from less than 15% to almost 30%, potentially setting the stage for a large increase in drought during July. On a more positive note, the percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing   and   drought) remained at less than 1%, for the second consecutive month. Drought conditions across the contiguous United States as of June 25, 2024. It's good news that extreme (red) and exceptional (dark red) drought was present in only small parts of New Mexico and Texas. Less good is the very large area that was abnormally dry (yellow); it may be headed toward drought, given the July temperature and precipitation outlooks. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by the  .  Regionally, drought developed or worsened in much of the eastern part of the nation, with degradation of up to 3 classes observed. Some degradation was also observed in the parts of the northern Great Plains and scattered portions of the Southern Plains (both 1-2 classes). In contrast, drought improvement was seen over small regions of the Central and Southern Plains (1-2 classes) as well as in southern Florida (up to 3 classes). Drought throughout Florida during June was quite interesting, with the aforementioned improvement in the South, but development in the North. With nearly 30% of the nation abnormally dry (D0) at the end of June, and a forecast favoring above-normal temperatures across most of the nation, the drought outlook for July predicts drought development across large parts of the northwestern, south-central and eastern parts of the country. These areas all saw soil moisture conditions worsen during June, and in general these regions are not expected to receive above-normal rainfall during the month, but are all favored to experience another hot summer month. U.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in July 2024. Several large areas of new drought are likely (yellow), and of the existing drought areas, only a small part of Florida is likely to see improvement (green). Elsewhere drought is expected to persist or worsen (brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center. Current drought in these locations is also expected to persist, if not worsen. In fact, the only area currently in drought expected to see improvement (and drought removal) is in Florida and adjacent Georgia, where a favorable precipitation forecast is coincident with a favorable time of year for soil moisture recharge.

Large, violent eruptions may match the rate of human emissions for the few hours that they last, but they are too rare and fleeting to rival humanity’s annual emissions. In fact, several individual U.S. states emit more carbon dioxide in a year than all the volcanoes on the planet combined do. On the scale of carbon dioxide emissions, human sources far outweigh volcanoes. NOAA Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh. Human activities—mostly burning of coal and other fossil fuels, but also cement production, deforestation and other landscape changes—emitted roughly 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2015. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, more than 2,000 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide have been added to the atmosphere by human activities according to the  Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, human emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and cement production (green line) have risen to more than 35 billion metric tons per year, while volcanoes (purple line) produce less than 1 billion metric tons annually. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on   from the   at the DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Burton  , 2013. Volcanoes emit carbon dioxide in two ways: during eruptions and through underground magma. Carbon dioxide from underground magma is released through vents, porous rocks and soils, and water that feeds volcanic lakes and hot springs. Estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions from volcanoes have to take both erupted and non-erupted sources into account. Much of the carbon dioxide released by volcanoes is emitted by degassing of subterranean magma when the volcano is not erupting. In this photo, volcanic gases and steam rise from Mount Merapi, Indonesia, on May 20, 2012.  In a 2011 peer-reviewed paper, U.S. Geologic Survey scientist Terry Gerlach summarized five previous estimates of global volcanic carbon dioxide emission rates that had been published between 1991 and 1998. Those estimates incorporated studies reaching back to the 1970s, and they were based on a wide variety of measurements, such as direct sampling and satellite remote sensing. The global estimates fell within a range of about 0.3 ± 0.15 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, implying that human carbon dioxide emissions were more than 90 times greater than global volcanic carbon dioxide emissions. On May 18, 1980, Mount Saint Helens experienced an explosive eruption, sending a column of ash, steam, and gases up to 60,000 feet above sea level. For about nine hours, carbon dioxide emissions from the volcano may have matched human emissions, but such massive eruptions are rare and fleeting. U.S. Geological Survey   by Robert Krimmel. In 2013, another group of scientists—Michael Burton, Georgina Sawyer, and Domenico Granieri—published an updated estimate using more data on carbon dioxide emissions from subsurface magma that had become available in the years since the last global estimate. While acknowledging a large range of variability in the estimates, the authors concluded that the best overall estimate was about 0.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. While higher than Gerlach's estimate, the figure is still just a fraction of carbon dioxide output from human activities. Gerlach remarked via email, “Taken at face value, their result implies that anthropogenic CO  exceeds global volcanic CO  by at least a factor of 60 times.” Occasionally, eruptions are powerful enough to release carbon dioxide at a rate that matches or even exceeds the global rate of human emissions for a few hours. For example, Gerlach estimated that the eruptions of Mount St. Helens (1980) and Pinatubo (1991) both released carbon dioxide on a scale similar to human output for about nine hours. Human emissions of carbon dioxide continue day after day, month after month, year after year. Volcanic activity today may pale in comparison to the carbon dioxide emissions we are generating by burning fossil fuels for energy, but over the course of geologic time, volcanoes   occasionally contributed to global warming by producing significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. For example, some geologists hypothesize that 250 million years ago, an extensive flood of lava poured continually from the ground in Siberia perhaps hundreds of thousands of years. This large-scale, long-lasting eruption likely raised global temperatures enough to cause one of the worst extinction events in our planet's history. Current volcanic activity doesn't occur on the same massive scale. Today, rather than warming global climate, volcanic eruptions often have the opposite effect. That's because carbon dioxide isn't the only thing that volcanoes inject into the atmosphere. Even small eruptions often produce volcanic ash and aerosol particles. Taken by astronauts from the Space Shuttle in early August 1991, this photo of the Earth's limb shows the double layer of volcanic aerosol particles (interpretation from  ) that spread through the stratosphere following the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Encircling the globe at altitudes even higher than the tops of thunderstorm clouds, the particles reflected so much incoming sunlight that global surface temperatures cooled off for two years.   courtesy NASA JSC's Gateway to Astronaut Photography of the Earth. Whether from small or large eruptions, volcanic aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, cooling global climate. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora produced enough ash and aerosols to cancel summer in Europe and North America in 1816. Boden, T.A., Marland, G., Andres, R.J. (2015).

The Yakima River Basin in the state of Washington supports a multibillion dollar agriculture sector. The value of apples, cherries, and other food and natural resources harvested from across the basin makes substantial contributions to the local, regional, and national economies. Additionally, the region has significant populations of salmon and steelhead trout. The fish are essential to tribal members' subsistence lifestyles and cultural traditions, and they support a thriving recreational fishing industry. Over a 15-year period in the recent past, the basin faced five years with drought conditions. The lack of water in each dry year had a strong negative impact on the region’s productivity and pointed out the risk that climate variability and change pose to the basin. Further, the Third National Climate Assessment and other studies indicate that the region can expect even more challenges as climate changes. Washington's Yakima River Basin is highlighted in white.

The Yakima Basin Integrated Water Resource Management Plan is a 30-year, $3.8 billion plan that restores ecological integrity to the region and provides assurances for meeting agricultural water needs even in the face of ongoing climate change. The plan is a collaborative effort to restore and protect ecosystems: it strategically and creatively addresses the realities of climate uncertainty and places the basin on a path to long-term resiliency. The plan lays out a set of key elements to help protect, mitigate, and enhance fish and wildlife habitat and improve the reliability of the region’s water supply. The elements include provision of fish passage at several points, enhanced water conservation efforts, habitat and watershed protection and enhancement, and structural and operational changes in storing and using surface water and groundwater. Implementation of the plan has been scheduled in three phases. The first phase, expected to be complete by 2025, has already begun with the purchase of 70,000 acres of forested lands. The lands will be managed for restoration and watershed conservation. The first phase also includes water conservation efforts, installation of fish passages, construction of a conveyance pipeline and a drought-relief pumping plant, and $100 million of river and stream restoration projects to benefit fish species. Proponents of the plan are currently seeking federal authority to fully implement its initial phase. They are also working to secure the designation of Wild and Scenic River for the upper Cle Elum River system, a section of the river basin that will facilitate restored salmon and steelhead runs after fish passage is installed at Cle Elum Dam. The Cle Elum River, a tributary to the Yakima River, will be home to a large salmon run after installation of fish passages at Cle Elum Dam. Image credit: Michael Garrity, American Rivers. Used with permission. The state of Washington and the federal government have both made investments that bring the Integrated Plan closer to reality. When the plan is fully implemented around 2040, the work group anticipates that the region will have a stable water supply that supports healthy populations of salmon and steelhead. The work group also anticipates that the basin will be able to meet the water needs of agriculture concerns, delivering at least 70 percent of allotted amounts even during drought conditions. The Integrated Plan facilitates long-term collaboration among many organizations, ultimately promoting ecological health and climate resilience in this productive river basin. Complementing the Integrated Plan, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation have also developed a  to align all governmental departments and programs, identify important resources and cultural components that may be particularly affected by projected climate change, and develop specific recommendations for deeper analysis and priority adaptive actions to take now.

This interactive map shows the average annual coldest winter temperatures across the contiguous United States for 1981-2010 divided into 10-degree \"planting zone\" bins.

If you   of the map, you can tab between three map layers: the planting zones as of 1981-2010 (the most recent U.S. Climate Normals), planting zones during 1971-2000 (the previous Normals period), and places where a given planting zone has shifted northward or upward in elevation between the two time periods. These shifts are due to long-term warming of winter minimum temperatures. In those areas, warmer nights are allowing plant species to shift their range northward or upward in elevation. Updated each decade, the   from NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information are 30-year averages of many pieces of weather information collected from thousands of weather stations nationwide. Each time they are updated, an old decade is dropped, and a new one is added. The last update was in July 2011: the decade 1971-1980 was dropped, 2001-2010 was added, and the new 30-year window for the U.S. Climate Normals became 1981-2010. Since the '70s was an unusually cool decade, while 2001-2010 was the warmest ever recorded, it is not surprising that the average temperature rose for most locations. For the United States as a whole, though, it was not daytime highs (maximum temperatures) but overnight lows (minimum temperatures) that rose the most compared with the 1970s. Climate normals can help people understand what conditions they can expect wherever they may live… and plant. A previous   on Climate.gov explored the implications of the new climate normals for gardeners and landscapers. Not only can plants can generally survive farther north than they used to, but the fire season is longer and pests are able to thrive and spread in forests and other natural landscapes. Pollination patterns may also be changing. The   confirms that landscapes across the country are changing rapidly. The report predicts that “species, including many iconic species, may disappear from regions where they have been prevalent or become extinct, altering some regions so much that their mix of plant and animal life will become almost unrecognizable. These maps of climate-related planting zones were created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 2011 as a special service to the American Public Garden Association. (In 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also updated their official  , the standard by which gardeners and growers can determine which plants are most likely to thrive at a location.) Based on the average of the coldest daily temperature at a location each year during the respective 30-year periods, the maps illustrate one way in which climate change in recent decades can influence Americans' day to day lives. .

Experts think the additional warming from this “hidden” heat are unlikely to exceed 0.9° Fahrenheit (0.5°Celsius). With no further human influence, natural processes would begin to slowly remove the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and global temperatures would gradually begin to decline. Change in heat content in the upper 2,300 feet (700 meters) of the ocean from 1993-2020. Between 1993–2019, heat content rose by up to 6 Watts per square meter in parts of the ocean (dark orange). Some areas lost heat (blue), but overall, the ocean gained more heat than it lost. The changes in areas covered with the gray shading were not statistically significant.

It’s true that without dramatic action in the next couple of decades, we are unlikely to keep global warming in this century below 2.7° Fahrenheit (1.5° Celsius) compared to pre-industrial temperatures—a threshold that experts say offers a lower risk of serious negative impacts. But the more we overshoot that threshold, the more serious and widespread the negative impacts will be, which means that it is never “too late” to take action. In response to a request from the U.S. Congress, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences published a series of peer-reviewed reports, titled  , to provide authoritative analyses to inform and guide responses to climate change across the nation. Relevant to this question, the NAS report titled   explains policies that could be adopted to slow or even reverse global warming. The report says, \"Meeting internationally discussed targets for limiting atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and associated increases in global average temperatures will require a major departure from business as usual in how the world uses and produces energy.\" Transitioning to energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases, such as solar, wind, biofuels, and nuclear, can slow the pace of climate change, though these energy sources face hurdles ranging from manufacturing capacity to debates about where to install some facilities. Images courtesy Energy.gov. Alternative methods to slow or reduce global warming have been proposed that are, collectively, known as \"climate engineering\" or \"geoengineering.\" Some geoengineering proposals involve cooling Earth's surface by injecting reflective particles into the upper atmosphere to scatter and reflect sunlight back to space. Other proposals involve seeding the oceans with iron to stimulate large-scale phytoplankton blooms, thereby drawing down carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Such methods could work, in principle, but many climate scientists oppose undertaking geoengineering until we have a much better understanding of the possible side effects. Additionally, there are unresolved legal and ethical issues surrounding geoengineering. Given these concerns, the   (readopted in January 2013) in which it said: \"...research to date has not determined whether there are large-scale geoengineering approaches that would produce significant benefits, or whether those benefits would substantially outweigh the detriments.

This next evolution of the Pacific TAO array—  is short for “Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean”—marks the first time the network in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean has seen such a substantial upgrade since the original array was completed in 1994.  The new capabilities will give scientists an unparalleled look at the complex ocean-atmospheric interactions across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, namely the   climate patterns, which affect global climate every few years. To understand how the planned upgrade, which scientists and engineers refer to as the “TAO Recap,” is shaking things up, you need to know what is currently out there. Let’s start with the basics: the TAO buoy array is a set of 55 moored buoys that are anchored to the seafloor in a series of parallel north-to-south lines from the western Pacific (165°E) to the eastern Pacific (95°W). The new locations of the moored buoys in the Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean array. The new fixed locations were chosen to complement data from other types of sensors, such as drifters and Argo sub-surface floats. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the National Data Buoy Center. Above the ocean, these buoys measure conditions like wind speed and direction, relative humidity, and air temperature. In the water, they measure ocean temperatures at the sea surface and 10 other depths in the upper 500 meters. At four specific moorings, they also measure horizontal and/or vertical currents, as well as radiation from the sun and earth, rain, and barometric pressure. Since their installation starting in 1985 and ending 1994, the TAO array has provided scientists with a remarkable amount of data documenting the variability of the ocean and atmosphere across the Pacific. These data have been fundamental to advancing our knowledge of how El Niño and La Niña start and end, and also vital to improving our ability to accurately simulate and predict them in climate models. In fact, that was part of the reason for the array’s existence to begin with: the strong El Niño of 1982-83 caught scientists and the world by surprise, in large part due to a lack of observations across the Pacific Ocean. TAO Recap is the result of a multi-year project, started in 2014, to modernize the array and gather more detailed data on some still less frequently monitored conditions and locations across the Pacific Ocean. This effort was spurred in part after the NOAA Ship Ka’Imimoana, commissioned specifically to service the buoys, was de-commissioned in 2012. Loading buoy equipment and personnel on the   while at the port of San Diego, California, prior to a 2022 research cruise through the Pacific Ocean that deployed a prototype of the new TAO buoy for testing. NOAA photo. The upgraded array will remove some buoy locations from the previous TAO array (12 buoys in total), while also putting additional buoys (five in total) in some locations to get a better view of ocean movement and the northern Intertropical Convergence Zone—where the northeast and southeast trade winds converge during the northern hemisphere summer. Better wind and rain observations in the Intertropical Convergence Zone will have multiple payoffs, including ground-truth for satellite-based wind estimates in areas with heavy rain and more real-time data in parts of the ocean where many tropical cyclones are born. And that’s the big point of this project. Scientists have used the multi-decade observational records and knowledge obtained from TAO to pinpoint what the scientific community needs to know in which locations to better understand and predict the ocean and climate. All so that the public can receive better forecasts. One of those needs and desires was a better understanding of the ocean’s  —a striking feature of the open ocean where salinity, temperature and density are almost vertically uniform. The surface mixed layer across the equatorial Pacific Ocean plays a critical role in El Niño and La Niña as   of the ocean basin. The new basic TAO Recap buoy will have five to seven additional measurements of the mixed layer from 10 m to 60 m. This represents a large increase from the existing network which measures the mixed layer at three levels beneath the surface. A more detailed look at the mixed layer will not only help scientists better understand how it changes during El Niño and La Niña events, but also help models better simulate these events. All of which, hopefully, will lead to better predictions and preparedness. Buoys in the Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean (TAO) Array in the equatorial Pacific are anchored to the bottom of the ocean in a series of parallel lines of longitude. (Drawing is not to scale). The buoys along a given longitude are spaced more than 100 miles apart. The new versions of the TAO buoys have temperature sensors at more depths than previous ones, giving a more detailed picture of the upper ocean heat content. NOAA Climate.gov drawing. Another need addressed by TAO Recapitalized buoy will be the inclusion of barometric pressure, rain, and solar radiation measurements across the array. Even better, these observations will all be transmitted in ten-minute increments. Currently, observations are only transmitted hourly. But wait, there’s more! The TAO Recapitalized array will also include a subset of buoys capable of observing real-time ocean current data not only at the surface but at depth, meaning an entire current profile from 11 to 315 meters. In particular, there will be a band of these enhanced buoys along a north-south line from 2°N-2°S at 140°W that will monitor the equatorial undercurrent when it is shallow. The equatorial undercurrent is an ocean current that runs eastward across the length of the tropical Pacific Ocean at depths of 50 to 200 meters. The current plays a vital role in El Niño and La Niña events by moving heat eastward across the Pacific Ocean. As you can imagine, many scientists are waiting with bated breath for the better equipped and more strategically placed array to be deployed and the data to arrive. But we don’t have to wait until the whole network is deployed to understand the benefits of the new instruments.  As part of a  , scientists added new instruments and capabilities to a handful of existing TAO buoys. The data the instruments recorded highlighted to scientists the need for more and improved observations in the mixed layer to help climate models better simulate and scientists better understand the complexities of the Pacific Ocean. One such example is a comparison of two ocean temperature profiles from the surface to 75 meters at a buoy located at 2°S 165°E–one profile created using observations at current depth levels, and the other at the additional levels once TAO Recapitalized buoys are deployed. Having data from additional depths uncovered some episodes when heat from the surface penetrated deeper into the water column than the older buoy was able to capture (60 meters compared to 50 meters). At other times, the new buoys showed that pulses of heating at the surface remained quite shallow, mixing down no more than 5 meters, whereas the old buoy implied that heat had mixed down as deep as 20 meters.  Each column in these images is one day of temperature data in the upper 80 meters of the tropical Pacific Ocean recorded by a buoy at 2˚ South, 165˚ East. Newer buoy sensors show that at times, such as the second half of July, heat penetrated the water column more deeply than old buoy sensors implied. At other times, such as mid-August, heat stayed closer to the surface than measurements from older buoys suggested. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from Karen Grissom. Large images:   |  . This improved observation of just where and when heat does and doesn’t reach deeper parts of the ocean could have profound impacts on modeling and seasonal predictions of climate phenomena like the El Niño Southern Oscillation. How? At its core, El Niño is a transfer of heat and energy between the western and eastern Pacific Ocean through subsurface waves of warm water. A better picture of when surface heat has or hasn’t penetrated deeper waters can lead to better predictions of when and where that heat moves. The next TAO Recapitalized buoy deployment mission is ongoing right now as the eastern portion of the array is serviced. By the end of this fiscal year, there will be five prototype buoys deployed across the Pacific, with one of them providing publicly available data. The rest will be monitored by engineers and scientists and cross-checked with existing data to make sure they are operating as expected. The big jump in deployment comes in the next few years as 15 new buoys are deployed in fiscal year 2025 and 2026, with the remainder deployed in 2027. This process represents just another chapter in the storied history of the TAO array. From its origins in the 1970s as NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory’s , to the expansion in the 1980s and 1990s under the , to the addition of more buoys in the western Pacific by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology which resulted in the renaming of the array to . The new TAO array, also known asTAO Recap, is expected to provide data that will significantly improve our understanding of the Pacific Ocean, improving climate predictions for millions across the globe.  The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) is part of NOAA’s National Weather Service and is charged with collecting and disseminating marine observations, while also designing and maintaining our ocean observing network. The TAO Recap array is just one type of array that NDBC operates and maintains. Others include the DART array, or “Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis” array which helps to detect tsunamis as well as the Coastal Weather Buoy network, a suite of near-shore and deep-ocean moored buoys which monitor weather and ocean conditions vital for weather forecasting. Simply put, if a buoy is in the ocean making observations, it’s likely the National Data Buoy Center had a hand.  .  NDBC Facebook:   NDBC Twitter:    Help us improve our content"},

Those ancient climates would have been like nothing our species has ever seen.", "content": "Our 4.54-billion-year-old planet probably experienced its hottest temperatures in its earliest days, when it was still colliding with other rocky debris ( ) careening around the solar system. The heat of these collisions would have kept Earth molten, with top-of-the-atmosphere temperatures upward of 3,600° Fahrenheit. Even after those first scorching millennia, however, the planet has often been much warmer than it is now. One of the warmest times was during the geologic period known as the Neoproterozoic, between 600 and 800 million years ago. Conditions were also frequently sweltering between 500 million and 250 million years ago. And within the last 100 million years, two major heat spikes occurred: the Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse (about 92 million years ago), and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (about 56 million years ago). Cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh, NOAA Climate.gov. Temperature records from thermometers and weather stations exist only for a tiny portion of our planet's 4.54-billion-year-long life. By studying indirect clues—the chemical and structural signatures of rocks, fossils, and crystals, ocean sediments, fossilized reefs, tree rings, and ice cores—however, scientists can infer past temperatures. None of these techniques help with the   early Earth. During the time known as the Hadean (yes, because it was like Hades), Earth’s collisions with other large planetesimals in our young solar system—including a Mars-sized one whose impact with Earth likely created the Moon—would have melted and vaporized most rock at the surface. Because no rocks on Earth have survived from so long ago, scientists have estimated early Earth conditions based on observations of the Moon and on astronomical models. Following the collision that spawned the Moon, the planet was estimated to have been around 2,300 Kelvin (3,680°F). What the collision that spawned Earth's Moon may have looked like. Collisions between Earth and rocky debris in the early solar system would have kept the surface molten and surface temperatures blistering. Image courtesy  .  Even after collisions stopped, and the planet had tens of millions of years to cool, surface temperatures were likely more than 400° Fahrenheit.   from Australia, only about 150 million years younger than the Earth itself, hint that our planet may have cooled faster than scientists previously thought. Still, in its infancy, Earth would have experienced temperatures far higher than we humans could possibly survive. But suppose we exclude the violent and scorching years when Earth first formed. When else has Earth’s surface sweltered? Between 600 and 800 million years ago—a period of time geologists call the Neoproterozoic—evidence suggests the Earth underwent an   so cold that ice sheets not only capped the polar latitudes, but may have extended all the way to sea level near the equator. Reflecting ever more sunlight back into space as they expanded, the ice sheets cooled the climate and reinforced their own growth. Obviously, the Earth didn’t remain stuck in the freezer, so how did the planet thaw?  A geologic history of Earth since its formation 4.6 billion years ago, divided by eon and period, and showing fossils typical of a given period. Fossils reveal not only ancient plants and animals, but also ancient climates.

Volcanoes emit the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. In our current, mostly ice-free world, the natural weathering of silicate rock by rainfall consumes carbon dioxide over geologic time scales. During the frigid conditions of the Neoproterozoic, rainfall became rare. With volcanoes churning out carbon dioxide and little or no rainfall to weather rocks and consume the greenhouse gas, temperatures climbed. What evidence do scientists have that all this actually happened some 700 million years ago? Some of the best evidence is \" \" lying directly over Neoproterozoic-age glacial deposits. Cap carbonates—layers of calcium-rich rock such as limestone—only form in warm water. Rock formation in Namibia that shows a type of rock that only forms in warm water (cap dolostone) lying directly over a type of jumbled sedimentary rock, dated to 635 million years ago, that is commonly found at the margin of glaciers (diamictite). Image from  available at SnowballEarth.org. The fact that these thick, calcium-rich rock layers sat directly on top of rock deposits left behind by retreating glaciers indicate that temperatures rose significantly near the end of the Neoproterozoic, perhaps reaching a global average higher than 90° Fahrenheit. (Today's global average is lower than 60°F.) A Smithsonian Institution project has tried to reconstruct temperatures for the Phanerozoic Eon, or roughly the last half a billion years.   released in 2019 showed warm temperatures dominating most of that time, with global temperatures repeatedly rising above 80°F and even 90°F—much too warm for ice sheets or perennial sea ice. About 250 million years ago, around the equator of the supercontinent Pangea, it was even too hot for peat swamps! Preliminary results from a Smithsonian Institution project led by Scott Wing and Brian Huber, showing Earth's average surface temperature over the past 500 million years.  For most of the time, global temperatures appear to have been too warm (red portions of line) for persistent polar ice caps. The most recent 50 million years are an exception. Image adapted from Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Geologists and paleontologists have found that, in the last 100 million years, global temperatures have peaked twice. One spike was the Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse roughly 92 million years ago, about 25 million years before Earth’s last dinosaurs went extinct. Widespread volcanic activity may have boosted atmospheric carbon dioxide. Temperatures were so high that champsosaurs (crocodile-like reptiles) lived as far north as the Canadian Arctic, and warm-temperature forests thrived near the South Pole. Another hothouse period was the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) about 55-56 million years ago. Though not quite as hot as the Cretaceous hothouse, the PETM brought  . During much of the Paleocene and early Eocene, the poles were free of ice caps, and palm trees and crocodiles lived above the Arctic Circle. Around the time of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, much of the continental United States had a sub-tropical environment. This fossil palm is from Fossil Butte National Monument, Wyoming. Image courtesy U.S.  During the PETM, the global mean temperature appears to have risen by as much as 5-8°C (9-14°F) to an average temperature as high as 73°F. (Again, today’s global average is shy of 60°F.) At roughly the same time, paleoclimate data like fossilized phytoplankton and ocean sediments record a massive release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, at least doubling or possibly even quadrupling the background concentrations. Global surface temperatures were generally high throughout the Paleocene and Eocene, with a particularly warm spike at the boundary between the two geological epochs around 56 million years ago. Temperatures in the distant past are inferred from proxies, in this case, oxygen isotope ratios from fossil foraminifera, single-celled marine organisms. \"Q\" stands for Quaternary.

It is still uncertain where all the carbon dioxide came from and what the exact sequence of events was. Scientists have considered the drying up of large inland seas, volcanic activity, thawing permafrost, release of methane from warming ocean sediments, huge wildfires, and even—briefly—a comet. Earth’s hottest periods—the Hadean, the late Neoproterozoic, the Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse, the PETM—occurred before humans existed. Those ancient climates would have been like nothing our species has ever seen. Modern human civilization, with its permanent agriculture and settlements, has developed over just the past 10,000 years or so. The period has generally been one of low temperatures and relative global ( ) climate stability. Compared to most of Earth’s history, today is unusually cold; we now live in what geologists call an interglacial—a period between glaciations of an ice age. But as greenhouse-gas emissions warm Earth’s climate, it's possible our planet has seen its last glaciation for a long time. British Geological Survey.  . Accessed February 7, 2022. Engber, D.

Not only are weather models predicting different things than climate models, they require different kinds of starting information.

In contrast, most modelers describe a climate projection as a   problem because at long time scales (years to decades), future climate depends mostly on big-picture characteristics of the Earth system that don’t vary from day to day: the amount of land and ocean surface, the height and location of mountain ranges, the geometry of Earth’s orbit, and—crucially—the composition of the global atmosphere. These things define the boundaries of the climate system, the relatively narrow range of outcomes that are possible over long time frames.

The values are shown as change in sea level in millimeters compared to the 1993-2008 average. NOAA Climate.gov image based on analysis and data from Philip Thompson,  . Global mean sea level has risen about 8–9 inches (21–24 centimeters) since 1880. The rising water level is mostly due to a combination of melt water from glaciers and ice sheets and thermal expansion of seawater as it warms. In 2023, global mean sea level was 101.4 millimeters (3.99 inches) above 1993 levels, making it the highest annual average in the satellite record (1993-present). In some ocean basins, sea level has risen as much as 6-8 inches (15-20 centimeters) since the start of the satellite record. Regional differences exist because of natural variability in the strength of winds and ocean currents, which influence how much and where the deeper layers of the ocean store heat. The global mean water level in the ocean rose by 0.14 inches (3.6 millimeters) per year from 2006–2015, which was 2.5 times the average rate of 0.06 inches (1.4 millimeters) per year throughout most of the twentieth century.

In some ocean basins, sea level has risen 6-8 inches (15-20 centimeters).

Past and future sea level rise   on land may be more or less than the global average due to local factors: ground settling, upstream flood control, erosion, regional ocean currents, and whether the land is still rebounding or resettling from the compressive weight of vanished Ice Age glaciers. In the United States, the fastest rates of sea level rise are occurring in the Gulf of Mexico from the mouth of the Mississippi westward, followed by the mid-Atlantic.

As seas rise, saltwater is also  , many of which sustain municipal and agricultural water supplies and natural ecosystems. Global warming is causing global mean sea level to rise in two ways. First, glaciers and ice sheets worldwide   and adding water to the ocean. Second, the volume of the ocean is expanding as the water warms. A third, much smaller contributor to sea level rise is a decline in the amount of liquid water on land—aquifers, lakes and reservoirs, rivers, soil moisture. This shift of liquid water from land to ocean is largely due to people depleting ground water. From the 1970s up through the last decade or so, melting and heat expansion were contributing roughly equally to observed sea level rise. But the melting of   and ice sheets has accelerated: As a result, the amount of sea level rise due to melting (with a small addition from groundwater transfer and other water storage shifts) from 2005–2013 was nearly twice the amount of sea level rise due to thermal expansion.

Sea level is measured by two main methods:  and  . Tide gauge stations from around the world have measured the daily high and low tides for more than a century, using a variety of manual and automatic sensors. Using data from scores of stations around the world, scientists can calculate a global average and adjust it for seasonal differences. Since the early 1990s, sea level has been measured from space using radar altimeters, which determine the height of the sea surface by measuring the return speed and intensity of a radar pulse directed at the ocean. The higher the sea level, the faster and stronger the return signal is. Observed sea level since the start of the satellite altimeter record in 1993 (black line), plus independent estimates of the different contributions to sea level rise: thermal expansion (red) and added water, mostly due to glacier melt (blue). Added together (purple line), these separate estimates match the observed sea level very well. NOAA Climate.gov graphic, adapted from Figure 3.15a in  . To estimate how much of the observed sea level rise is due to thermal expansion, scientists measure sea surface temperature using moored and  , satellites, and water samples collected by ships. Temperatures in the upper half of the ocean are measured by a global fleet of  . Deeper temperatures are measured by instruments lowered from oceanographic research ships. To estimate how much of the increase in sea level is due to actual mass transfer—the movement of water from land to ocean—scientists rely on a combination of direct measurements of melt rate and glacier elevation made during field surveys, and   of tiny shifts in Earth’s gravity field. When water shifts from land to ocean, the increase in mass increases the strength of gravity over oceans by a small amount. From these gravity shifts, scientists estimate the amount of added water. As global temperatures continue to warm, additional sea level rise is inevitable. How much and by when depends mostly on the future rate of greenhouse gas emissions. But another source of uncertainty is whether big ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland will melt in a steady, predictable way as the Earth gets warmer, or whether they will reach a tipping point and rapidly collapse. Every four or five years, NOAA leads an interagency task force that reviews the latest research on sea level rise and issues a report on likely— and ‘unlikely but plausible’—amounts future sea level rise for different greenhouse gas and global warming pathways. In the 2022 report, the task force concluded that even on the pathway with the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions and warming (1.5 degrees C), global mean sea level would rise at least 0.3 meters (1 foot) above 2000 levels by 2100. On a pathway with very high rates of emissions that trigger rapid ice sheet collapse, sea level could be as much as 2 meters (6.6 feet) higher in 2100 than it was in 2000. Observed sea level from 2000-2018, with future sea level through 2100 for six future pathways (colored lines)  The pathways differ based on future rates of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming and differences in the plausible rates of glacier and ice sheet loss. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from Sweet et al., 2022.  One piece of good news: the task force concluded that an extreme possibility (8.2 feet above 2000 levels by 2100) that they couldn’t rule out at the time of their 2017 report appears to be less likely based on the latest science. This doesn’t mean global sea level rise of that much won’t   happen, only that it is extremely unlikely to happen by 2100. Still, on a pathway with high greenhouse gas emissions, if processes triggering rapid ice sheet collapse kick in, global sea level could rise upwards of 3.7 meters (12 feet) higher in 2150 than it was in 2000. Now the bad news: the report reaffirmed that many parts of the United States can expect their local rate and overall amount of sea level rise to exceed the global average. Extrapolating from observed rates, sea levels on average along the contiguous U.S. are expected to rise as much over the next 30 years (10-12 inches over 2020-2050) as they have over the last 100 years (1920-2020). In some regions, the increases will be even larger. In the western Gulf of Mexico, for example, sea level rise is likely to be about 16-18 inches higher than 2020 levels by 2050—almost a ½ foot higher than the national average. Projections for U.S. sea level rise for the end of the century and beyond depend on which greenhouse gas pathway we follow and how the major ice sheets respond to this ocean and atmospheric warming. If we are able to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, U.S. sea level in 2100 is projected to be around 0.6 meters (2 feet) higher on average than it was in 2000. But on a pathway with high greenhouse gas emissions and rapid ice sheet collapse, models project that average sea level rise for the contiguous United States could be 2.2 meters (7.2 feet) by 2100 and 3.9 meters (13 feet) by 2150. These   are for education and communication purposes only. The early part of the time series shown in the graph above comes from the   of CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), Australia's national science agency. They are documented in Church and White (2011). The more recent part of the time series is from the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center ( ). It is based on a weighted average of 373 global tide gauge records collected by the U.S. National Ocean Service, UHSLC, and partner agencies worldwide. The weights for each gauge in the global mean are determined by a cluster analysis that groups gauges from locations where sea level tends to vary in the same way. This prevents over-emphasizing regions where there are many tide gauges located in close proximity. The most recent year of data should be considered preliminary. Scientific users should acquire research-quality data directly from UHSLC and/or the NOAA   webpage.

The famous Beach Boys lyric “ ” has a lot more to do with atmospheric science than one may realize. Our latest research has found that two atmospheric wave patterns forced from tropical systems, ENSO and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, work together to affect rainfall patterns in the United States, sometimes leading to extreme flooding or drought events ( ). Luckily, climate forecasters can analyze these large-scale waves to make predictions weeks and months in advance. Particularly important to U.S. weather and climate are atmospheric waves that start in the tropics and travel to the midlatitudes. One major source of these waves is the   (MJO). The MJO sounds fancy and, let’s be honest, boring, but it’s not! The MJO is a system of very tall or deep convective clouds (storminess) that travels eastward along the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans approximately every 30-60 days. The convective region of the MJO has enhanced storms and rainfall, and it is usually sandwiched to the east and west by dry, sunny areas. Averages of all January–March MJO events from 1979–2016. Green shading shows below-average OLR (outgoing longwave radiation, or heat energy) values, indicating more clouds and rainfall, and brown shading identifies above-average OLR (drier and clearer skies than normal). The purple contours show the location and strength of the Pacific jet at the 200-hPa level (roughly 38,000 feet at that location). Note the eastward movement of the wet and dry areas. How far the Pacific jet extends past the international dateline also changes with the phase of the MJO. NOAA Climate.gov animation, adapted from original images provided by Carl Schreck. These convective storms form from surface convergence of winds, which then rise and diverge at the top of the  . The convection disrupts the air at the top of the atmosphere, which results in long, planetary scale (~5,000 miles) waves that travel away from their tropical source into the midlatitudes near the top of the troposphere, like waves that ripple away on top of a lake from skipping stones. (1) These large-scale waves, known as  , are due to the rotation of the Earth and characterized by north-south undulations around high and low pressure systems. Like most waves, these waves carry signals: radio waves carry classic rock to your car, microwaves carry microwave radiation to heat your frozen dinner, and atmospheric waves carry temperature, pressure, and wind signals that can alter the weather. The atmospheric waves produced by the MJO can have different effects on the mid-latitudes depending on where the MJO convection (storminess) is on its journey from the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific (2). Our study analyzed the influence of the MJO during the Northern Hemisphere winter months, November-April, as this is when the MJO is typically strongest. We specifically focus on U.S. rainfall impacts since both drought and flooding events have vast societal, economic, and environmental impacts. While most prior studies investigated influences from the MJO on the West Coast, we focused on a strong relationship we discovered in the Southeast U.S. When the MJO starts out in the Indian Ocean and makes its way across Indonesia, the ripples it causes in the upper atmosphere often lead to a change in U.S. pressure patterns. Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is pushed over the Southeastern states, leading to rainfall. As the MJO makes its way into the central Pacific, the opposite pressure patterns head cool, dry air from the north to cause dryness in the Southeast U.S.  Another defining characteristic of the MJO is the dryness on both the east and west sides of the enhanced rainfall on the equator. These dry regions also create waves because of the sinking motion at the top of the atmosphere. An exciting area of research that others in our field are working on is how the waves from the rainy and dry regions of the MJO interact and influence North American weather patterns as the MJO is travelling around the globe ( ,  ). The S.S. ENSO cruise ship and MJO speedboat making their way across the \"harbor\" of the tropical Pacific Ocean. The cruise ship represents the stationary ENSO pattern creating steady, rolling waves. The speedboat represents the rapidly moving MJO travelling through the waves created by the S.S. ENSO, altering the wake that the MJO speedboat is producing. The floating person represents the United States that feels the impact from the both the cruise ship's wake and the speedboat's modified wake. Note that  refers to just a specific region in the U.S. that changes with time. The impacts from the MJO and ENSO wave interference can vary both in space and time. Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh.  Things get really choppy when we add ENSO to the mix. ENSO is a stationary pattern in the tropics, but the MJO is a traveling pattern roughly following the equator. In fact, ENSO is controlling the background through which the MJO is moving. Specific MJO events can vary depending on the state of ENSO. The strength of the MJO convection, how fast it moves eastward, and how far it travels all change based on ENSO conditions. These ENSO-modified MJO events then lead to varied impacts on U.S. rainfall. Imagine a massive cruise ship very slowly making its way back and forth through a harbor. As it moves, it creates steady, rolling waves. The MJO is then a speedboat, passing through the wake of the cruise ship. There are now two boats forcing waves in the same water. ENSO (cruise ship) modifies the MJO (speedboat) by altering the environment that the MJO is moving through. Since the speedboat is moving through already wavy water, it changes the wake that the speedboat produces (3). To complicate things further, these modified MJO waves  the ENSO waves are now both traveling at different speeds at the top of the atmosphere and interact with each other, in the same way the wakes from two boats interfere. The interaction of these waves and their signals plays a role in U.S. weather via changes in pressure, temperature, etc. Two climate signals interfering (i.e., combining) with each other. Bold blue curve sketches the result of the combination. Horizontal bars indicate conceptual thresholds for occurrence of extremely wet and dry events. Animation adapted by Climate.gov from   The waves from the MJO and the waves from ENSO together impact U.S. rainfall through constructive or destructive interference.   occurs when two waves are in phase (4), and the resultant wave has a much larger amplitude, resulting in a  stronger signal than either of the individual waves. The opposite, called  , occurs when two waves are out of phase and cancel each other (5). You may have experienced destructive signal interference when your radio signal gets interrupted by another station and you hear a mix of two stations or no sound at all. We can analyze constructive and destructive interference from the MJO and ENSO by looking at each U.S. rainfall signal individually (6). We can specifically look at the U.S. rainfall contribution from both the MJO and ENSO, for example, when the enhanced MJO convection is over Indonesia and an El Niño is happening, or when the MJO convection is in the central Pacific and La Niña is occurring. Since the MJO changes phase much faster than ENSO, we often see   persist for an entire season, whereas the rainfall from the MJO can change weekly. Constructive interference from the MJO and ENSO occurs when either wet or dry conditions occur in the same region simultaneously from both phenomena. Their signals are added together and the result is a much wetter- or- drier-than-average region. Destructive interference occurs when the same region experiences opposite signals from the MJO and ENSO, partially or fully masking one another. Precipitation in mm/day broken down by active MJO phase during the winter months (Nov-Apr) of the 1998-2001 La Niña event (cold ENSO phase). The plot shows MJO-only rain (left), ENSO-only rain (center), and MJO + ENSO rain (right). Black boxes denote prominent areas of constructive (top) or destructive (bottom) interference. This example shows that both constructive (amplified signal) and destructive (weakened signal) can happen during different MJO phases in the same ENSO event. Climate.gov image based on data from  .  Destructive interference can even lead to a total wipeout of a signal. We saw that during the 1998-2001 La Niña event. The wave from La Niña resulted in drier-than-normal conditions in the Southeast U.S., a common characteristic of La Niñas. However, when the MJO was either just forming or dissipating during the La Niña event, it brought wetter-than-average conditions to the same region. These two waves destructively interfered, essentially canceling each other out. (7) The result was simply average rainfall (no wetter- or drier-than-normal conditions) for that time period in the Southeast U.S. Constructive interference can also have notable impacts since the result is an intensified signal. This occurred in December 2015 when both the MJO and ENSO signals brought large amounts of rain to the Mississippi basin region, leading to massive flooding ( ) (8).  , rapidly developing droughts that can persist for weeks to months, can also be attributed to constructive interference. One such example was the summer of 2000 flash drought in the Southern U.S. when an ongoing La Niña event and active MJO both likely contributed dry signals to the region. Typical impacts of La Niña on U.S. winter temperature and precipitation. Such impacts have been associated with past episodes, but all impacts aren't seen with every episode. NOAA Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. Analysis of these events shows just how connected the tropics and the United States can be. Understanding how these waves interfere can improve our one-to-two week and monthly climate  . A longer lead time in a forecast for massive flooding or drought events can save lives, property, and money if our climate models can catch the waves from the MJO and ENSO. These atmospheric waves may not have us sitting on top of the world like the Beach Boys told us, but they are traveling pretty close (top of the troposphere to be exact) and could still have a big impact on the California surf. (1) This coupling between deep convection and a circulation pattern characterized by low-level convergence, upper-level divergence, and vice versa (sinking motion due to upper-level convergence and low-level divergence) is similar to the tropical  . (2) The location of above-average and below-average tropical convection can be seen in this graphic on the  .  (3) It is also believed that since the MJO itself is altered, then so are the atmospheric waves it produces that travel to the U.S. (4) In-phase waves have their highest and lowest points aligned.   (5) Out-of-phase waves will drastically reduce the amplitude, or height, of the waves which causes the resultant wave to be nearly flat and lose its signal. (6) We analyze the signals based on the state of each system: location of convective storms for the MJO and sea surface temperatures for ENSO. We then calculate the amount of rainfall that each signal contributed during specific conditions in the tropics, that is whether each contributed to wetter or drier conditions than average. (7) We saw this in California during the massive 2015-16 El Niño event. California often experiences much wetter-than-normal conditions during El Niños. During this event, however, the El Niño signal brought only a small amount of rain ( ;  ) and the MJO brought a dry signal to the California region. When the two are added together, the signals slightly cancel each other out and played a role in the drought in the California region during that time. During this particular case, El Niño did  bring the expected rain, and the MJO brought dryness, and the result contributed to a drought in California during a time when they expected a lot of rain. (8) According to NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information (  ), December 2015 was the only month in their 121-year period of record with both the title of warmest and wettest month. Furthermore, the severe precipitation events caused record flooding, severe weather, and heavy snowfall resulting in over 50 fatalities, the deadliest weather event of 2015. Arcodia, M. C., B. P.

And I’m sure my editor likely recoiled at how obtuse that opening love letter was. But let me explain. We at the ENSO Blog love ocean and weather observations.  And what better way to express that than through my attempt at an 18  century love letter.  And what better object of my love than the Tropical Atmospheric Ocean—or TAO—moored buoy array across the equatorial Pacific Ocean.  In a world of assumptions when it comes to ENSO, TAO provides something rare for the middle of the Pacific: real-time observations of atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Yes! But not just one buoy! TAO refers to a group of around 70 ocean moorings anchored to the sea floor across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These buoys measure atmospheric things like the winds, relative humidity, and air temperature and oceanic things like the sea surface temperature. One of the most important things the buoys measure is temperatures of the ocean at 10 depths in the upper 500 m (1640ft) of the ocean (more on why these matter later). The moorings are placed along a north-south line from the western Pacific (165°E) to the eastern Pacific (95°W), as if placed by the most methodical Battleship player ever.  And their placement in this specific area of the world is not random. TAO exists to help monitor and study climate phenomenon across the Pacific with a heavy emphasis on El Niño and La Niña. Plotted in blue circles are the sites of NOAA's TAO moored buoy array located across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Shaded in the background are the May 2017 sea surface temperature anomalies where red areas represent warmer than average conditions and blue areas represent colder than average conditions. The TAO buoy array helps scientists monitor and understand ENSO. NOAA Climate.gov image with sea surface temperature data from the   and TAO buoy data from NOAA's  These one-of-a-kind oceanic moorings owe their existence to a large international climate research program called the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere program , or TOGA, which began in 1985, shortly after the 1982-83 El Niño—one of the three strongest on record back to 1950--caught scientists off-guard. TOGA’s mission was to help figure out how predictable tropical phenomena (like ENSO)  are on seasonal to multi-year timescales, and how much observations in the tropics could improve climate predictions. Locations of sea surface temperature observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set ( ) for 20-year periods starting with the 1860-1879 period and ending with 1980-1999. The colors represent the percentage of months with at least one sea surface temperature measurement in each 2 degree by 2 degree grid box. The darker the color the higher the percentage of months in each 20-year period that has an observation. NOAA Climate.gov image with data from  . Prior to TOGA and TAO, there simply were not many observations across the Pacific Ocean to help scientists predict and understand ENSO. Scientists were like a person walking around with poor vision and no glasses. And when the ENSO picture is blurry, it can mean that even one of the strongest El Niños on record can catch the world by surprise, leaving little time for communities to prepare for the  . While there were some ocean observations from ships, buoys and satellites, nothing with the capabilities of the TAO existed until…well, TAO. This includes TAO’s ability not only to measure the surface but also the sub-surface in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. As Michelle has  , the subsurface can be where all the “action” is in a developing El Niño and La Niña, as that is where oceanic Kelvin waves reside. In fact, the first demonstration that an “oceanic Kelvin wave” actually helps to move warmer sub-surface water east during El Niño was very new in the early 1980s. Thanks to TAO, scientists now literally   it and more importantly can track it in near-real-time.  One classic example of this is how well TAO captured the 1997-1998 El Niño, which is widely regarded as the strongest since 1950. After the disaster of not seeing the 1982-83 event until it was too late, scientists--using observations like TAO--were able to forewarn the world many months prior to the peak of the 1997-98 event. A  , or hovmoller diagram, of the anomalous depth of the 20°C isotherm (line of constant temperature) was across the equatorial Pacific Ocean (2°N to 2°S) during the 1997-1998 El Niño event as recorded in a 5-day running average by the TAO moored buoy observations. The metric shown is the anomaly (departure from long-term average) in depth of the layer of ocean water with a temperature of 20°C. If this layer is lower than usual (positive values), that means more warm water. If the layer is higher than usual (negative values), there is less warm water than average. The dark line represents a 0m anomaly. NOAA Climate.gov image from data processed by the Instituto Geofisico Del Peru using the 1981-2010 climatology obtained from the NCEP Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS). TAO buoy data available from NOAA's  . Plus, once the observations in the Pacific Ocean came online, they were put into our climate models, greatly improving the models’ ability to predict ENSO events. The key revolutionary aspect of TAO was the ability to make subsurface temperature observations.  Research has shown that TAO data has reduced the uncertainty—made things less blurry—in tropical Pacific temperature analyses which are used not only to monitor ENSO but also to provide the initial view of the ocean in seasonal forecast models across the globe (Xue et al 2017). After all, just like a person with 20-400 vision putting on their first set of glasses, models tend to “see” the future better if they start with a more accurate view of the current state of the ocean and atmosphere. Well, their data can be found in hundreds of scientific journal articles, as TAO has been the predominant source of observations in the upper portion of the equatorial Pacific Ocean since the mid-1980s. In that time, TAO has not only become our global watchdog for developments in the Pacific Ocean but also has become vital in our ever-deepening understanding of just what makes ENSO tick. It has been TAO data, for instance, which has helped to corroborate   on ENSO formation. And will continue to do so for as long as TAO floats across the Pacific. Deploying a TAO buoy. TAO is a moored buoy array maintained by NOAA located across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Its surface and sub-surface observations are critical for our understanding of ENSO. NOAA photo taken on February 11, 2011. Photographer: Lieutenant Elizabeth Crapo, NOAA Corps. Hopefully! But it’s important to note that after all these years, TAO’s continued existence has never been a guarantee. TOGA, the program which gave us TAO, ended in 1994. Since then TAO has been supported by a myriad of sources. Currently, it is supported by NOAA as part of the operational ENSO observing system. It is important that we keep these buoys around. We wouldn’t want to lose our ENSO glasses. So I am glad that I could show some love to some incredibly important marine-based ocean observations.  Now if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go see what TAO is reporting today. McPhaden, M.J., A.J.

Rainfall estimates from NOAA's Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service for July 15, 2017. Numerous monsoonal thunderstorms dropped large amounts of rain across central and southern Arizona leading to flash floods. NOAA climate.gov image using data from NOAA's  . The rains fell during an active period of the North American Monsoon, or (within the U.S.) the Southwest Monsoon. During this time, intense rainfall can fall over the usually dry terrain of the southwestern United States including Phoenix, Arizona and California.  Though brief, these strong thunderstorms can dump a lot of rainfall. On July 15, storms dropped between 0.5-4 inches of rain across parts of southern Arizona, with much of this rainfall occurring over a relatively short period of time. The terrain north of Phoenix in the Tonto National Forest can be rugged and mountainous, full of narrow canyons. When heavy rain falls over this landscape it doesn’t get absorbed into the rock-hard ground. Instead, it runs off into normally dry river beds called arroyos or washes, which become raging rivers. Along the way, the water picks up whatever is in its path, so by the time it reaches miles down the river, the flow is mixed with dirt, rocks, brush, and trees. In Tonto National Forest, making matters worse, a wildfire in June not only made the ground more resistant to absorbing water (charred vegetation and ash are hydrophobic), but left burnt brush and trees to be swallowed up by rushing water. Flash floods are a major concern every summer across the Southwest for these exact reasons. As a final threat, the floods can appear to occur out of nowhere—in the midst of a perfectly sunny day—because isolated storms tens of miles away can be the source of the water that turns babbling brooks into deadly torrents. Tragically, on July 15, a flash flood took the lives of many members of one family out enjoying a day in nature. Monthly rainfall in inches averaged from 1981-2010 for Tucson, Arizona. The most rainfall occurs during July and August coinciding with the arrival and strengthening of the North American Monsoon. NOAA Climate.gov image using data from the  . Nope. India does not have sole custody of monsoons. But the mechanisms for why there is a summer monsoon in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico are similar to those in other parts of the world. During the summer months, the sun begins to heat up the arid landscapes of the U.S. Southwest and Mexico. The heated ground warms the overlying air, causing it to rise; the air pressure at the surface drops. The atmosphere likes to keep things equal, so it tries to push air towards places where air is leaving. For western North America, that means moisture-rich air from over the eastern Pacific and Gulf of California rushes in at low levels of the atmosphere. Meanwhile, higher up in the atmosphere there is more air than normal—also known as higher pressure. Because air tends to circle clockwise around a block of high pressure, easterly winds also bring in moisture from the  . As this moist air interacts with higher terrain, thunderstorms form. Unlike more tropical monsoons, where it isn’t uncommon for rain to fall nearly daily for weeks or months, the North American Monsoon does not mean constant rainfall as the mountains aren’t as high and the circulation patterns aren’t as strong. Instead, the rains can be episodic. Heavy when there is enough moisture but also separated by periods of dry conditions—another reason people may be caught off guard by flood-producing storms. In general, the monsoon kicks off in northwest Mexico in June and expands northward, reaching the southwestern United States in early July. By mid-July, the monsoon is well underway across Mexico and the desert Southwest. The monsoon comes to end as summer does—and the intense land surface heating subsides—with rainfall diminishing through September. The monsoon does have benefits for the area by providing relief from the intense summer sun, refilling reservoirs, and providing the bulk of the annual precipitation for the region. But it also can cause deadly flash floods like those seen recently. So if you do find yourself in the Southwest this summer, make sure to pay attention to forecasts from the   to be aware of any potential storms. Help us improve our content"},

After a year of dominance, El Niño released its hold on the tropical Pacific in May 2024, according to . El Niño—the warm phase of the   (ENSO), our planet’s single largest natural source of year-to-year variations in seasonal climate—has been disrupting climate in the tropics and beyond since May 2023, likely contributing to many months of record-high  , extreme  ,   and Central America, opposing wet and dry  ,  , and record-setting  .  (That’s an incomplete list! I’d love to see readers use the comments to identify all the seasonal climate extremes over the past year that are consistent with the typical influence of El Niño.) That’s a lot of climate upheaval. Is ENSO going to give us some time to idle in   (a state in between the warmer and cooler extremes of the El Niño-La Niña cycle) and catch our breaths? Not much, apparently. The tropical Pacific’s climate pendulum appears to be swinging back toward its other extreme:  . In the Pacific, La Niña brings cooler-than-average temperatures in the central-eastern part of the basin, stronger winds both near the surface and at high altitudes, and heavier rain than normal over Indonesia and the rest of the Maritime Continent. The forecasting team thinks there’s a 65 percent chance that La Niña will arrive by July-September.  For each upcoming 3-month season, NOAA forecasts the chances of El Niño (red bars), La Niña (blue bars), or neutral conditions (gray bars) in the tropical Pacific. Neutral is overwhelmingly favored for the May-July period (labeled MJJ on the graph), but the chances for La Niña increase rapidly as soon as the June-August (JJA) period. By late summer (July-August-September, JAS), odds of La Niña are 65 percent. NOAA graph by Michelle L’Heureux. That timing means there’s a pretty good chance La Niña will be around to influence the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. (1) Even if the transition occurs more slowly, the odds of La Niña being in place by Northern Hemisphere winter are still 85 percent, which is similar to the NOAA forecast in previous months. Given those odds, it’s probably a good idea to refresh your memory of the   on U.S. temperature and precipitation.  Emily explained in our April update that the atmospheric part of El Niño—weak-to-absent east-to-west trade winds across the tropical Pacific, dryness over Indonesia, strong convection and rainfall east of the International Dateline—had more or less shut down by early April. But surface water temperatures in the central-eastern tropical Pacific were still more than a degree Celsius (nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the long-term average (long-term = 1991-2020), and some parts of the tropics still appeared to be   Forecasters concluded it was too soon to issue El Niño’s curtain call.  Without the atmosphere reinforcing those warm anomalies (  means “difference from average”), however, surface temperatures cooled off significantly through April and May. We’re already seeing stronger easterly (from the east) trade winds, which have cooled the overheated surface waters. You can see it happening in the animation below.  This animation shows weekly sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean compared to average from March 18-June 9, 2024. Orange and red areas were warmer than average; blue areas were cooler than average. Warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the key ENSO-monitoring region of the tropical Pacific (outlined with black box) have started to be replaced by cooler-than-average waters—a sign that La Niña may be brewing. NOAA Climate.gov animation, based on Coral Reef Watch Data and maps from     in its own browser window.  The most recent weekly and monthly observations from the key ENSO-monitoring region (dubbed  ) show surface temperatures are close to average, and now cooler, deeper waters have begun surfacing. Now that both the atmosphere and the ocean have shifted away from El Niño, the event is truly over. Beneath the surface of the eastern pacific, a pool of cool water has been lurking for several months in standby mode, ready to re-supply the surface and intensify the cool anomaly required to create and maintain La Niña.  Water temperatures in the top 300 meters (1,000 feet) of the tropical Pacific Ocean compared to the 1991–2020 average in February–April 2024. NOAA Climate.gov animation, based on data from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. Of course, one of the most common questions we receive from readers is how strong do we expect the predicted La Niña to be? As far as model forecasts go, it’s too soon to put much stock in the forecasts: we’re just barely out of the notorious spring predictability barrier. The   is still pretty wide.  So, how about historical events? Does coming off a relatively strong El Niño like the recent one mean the developing La Niña will also be strong? That’s the question I posed to the team via email earlier this week. In true scientist fashion, Michelle answered me with a plot (2), which I have translated below. Since 1950, there have been 10 cases in which the ENSO climate pattern flipped from El Niño to La Niña with no neutral winter in between. Each line on this graph shows the evolution of sea surface temperature anomalies in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific (the key ENSO-monitoring region) through the switch. Many, but not all, of the strongest El Niños (red lines) evolved into strong La Niñas. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on analysis by Michelle L'Heureux.   First things first, let’s acknowledge that there have only been 10 times in the historical record where ENSO flipped from El Niño into La Niña within a year. That’s not enough examples to draw any   conclusions from. Still, it’s interesting to look at what we have and speculate as to what it might mean, so that’s all I am doing here.  Each line on the graph above represents a year in which the tropical Pacific shifted from El Niño to La Niña with no neutral winter in between. The lines are colored based on the strength of the El Niño: red for strong events (peak Niño 3.4-region sea surface temperature anomalies above 1.5 ˚C, or 2.7 ˚F), orange for moderate events (peak anomaly between 1 and 1.5 ˚C, or 1.8-2.7 ˚F), and pink for weak events (peak anomaly less than 1 ˚C, or 1.8 ˚F).  The relationship between the strength of the El Niño and the strength of the subsequent La Niña is kinda messy. It’s unlikely, but not impossible, for weak and moderate El Niños to lead to a strong La Niña (Niño 3.4 temperature anomaly of more than 1.5 ˚C below average). Only one of the pink and orange lines gets below that threshold. Meanwhile, 4 of the 6 strong El Niños do evolve into strong La Niñas. But before we put too much stock in that pattern, we should note that the strongest El Niño of all (top red line at the left hand side of the graph) wound up developing into the weakest La Niña (3). So…yeah. It’s complicated.  The likely strength of the upcoming La Niña will become clearer the closer we get, and you’ll hear more about that in coming posts. Of course, it’s also important to remember that the strength of a given El Niño or La Niña isn’t a good predictor of the strength of the temperature or precipitation impacts in a particular place. Stronger events do make it more likely that places prone to be influenced by El Niño or La Niña will experience   level of their typical impacts, but they don’t necessarily lead to   impacts. In other words, even a moderate or weak La Niña can have a strong impact on a given place. So it’s important to pay attention to what we already know, which is that odds are very high (85% chance) that this winter will feature La Niña. If you’d like to know more about what a La Niña winter might mean for your part of the world, here are some great places to start.  Hi.

I looked up the PDO readings, and found that the last ENSO / neutral reading 0.00 was December 2019. With ENSO / La Nina a sure bet for this Fall and Winter, and it will be reacting with the atmosphere, because it's forming on a negative PDO. Here in Kentucky we will most likely experience another snowless Winter. A longtime ago ( 1917 - 18 ) we were in an La Nina year and recorded a very cold and snowy Winter.

Submitted by   on Fri, 06/14/2024 - 12:27 Hi-- we are favoring La Nina with a peak probability of 85% so still not 100% (some would consider that a sure bet).  ENSO is based on coupled physics that happen within the tropical Pacific Ocean, so we primarily focus on the tropics.  The PDO is interesting insofar as it may feedback on the topics, but that effect is considered small on seasonal timescales and more relevant to decadal averages.   Submitted by   on Fri, 06/14/2024 - 13:22 In reply to   by  Hola me gustaría saber cómo analizar los datos que se tienen respeto al impacto de Fenómeno de La Niña en Perú.

Submitted by   on Fri, 06/14/2024 - 14:58 Hi-- good question.  There is no one month where all of the sudden the accuracy gets considerably better, but generally the biggest rate of change is April-May-June, so there is an argument that we're over the hump, so to speak. With that said, the accuracy of our forecasts will increase the closer we get to the season that we are forecasting.  So every month helps with the fine tuning.  You're right that the forecasted intensity is not as strong as it was in previous months.

Submitted by   on Tue, 06/18/2024 - 10:45 Well...Based on past episodes, El Niño has a small and not very reliable   influence on summer temps in the contiguous U.S. It tends to have a bigger and more consistent impact on winter temperature and precipitation. We know that   reason we are seeing increasingly frequent occurrences of record heat in the U.S. is long-term global warming. Averaged across Texas, summer temperatures have warmed by a tenth of a degree each decade since 1895, mostly due to warming nighttime temperatures.  Scientists would have to do a kind of scientific study called an  in order to understand how much El Niño or other kinds of natural variability also contributed to any specific year's record heat.  Submitted by   on Fri, 06/21/2024 - 13:48 In reply to   by  The flip from a 3 year La Nina, to 1 year El Nino, then quickly back to La Nina is really interesting.  It seems there isn't symmetry between the 2 phases.  Would it be accurate to say ENSO processes are similar to the process of a volcano gathering molten magma before eruption? As well, there have been numerous explanations for the ENSO cycles (trade winds being the huge factor) but one of the more recent parsimonious explanations is volcano like as it states: \"Think of the tropical Pacific as if it is a battery storing a charge, and the charge is thermal radiation coming in from the sun.  Every cool La Nina phase is like a battery gathering and storing a charge from the sun, while every El Nino phase is like a battery discharging its thermal store.\" This seems logical and to the point, without getting into trade winds and other complicated dynamic atmospheric processes.  But is the above description accurate?  The above description does help differentiate ENSO as a standard atmospheric process vs. being a climate change process, which seems to be a popular misguided view. Submitted by   on Wed, 06/19/2024 - 13:30 The idea that during La Niña the tropical Pacific is storing energy--\"charging like a battery\"— and during El Niño it is discharging energy seems like a reasonable analogy for the   of the ocean and atmosphere processes that drive the ENSO pattern phenomenon. But climate scientists aren't just interested in the result; they want to understand why and how things happen in the climate system. You say a battery analogy allows us to dispense with all those messy and \"complicated atmospheric dynamic processes.\" But a simple battery analogy would provide no explanation for all the parts of the system that we can easily observe. It doesn't explain why \"the battery\" is located in the western tropical Pacific and not the whole Pacific. It doesn't explain why the battery would   discharge as opposed to endlessly accumulating energy. It doesn't explain why there is no equally strong battery in the tropical Atlantic Ocean or the tropical Indian Ocean, etc.  In other words, if we ever want to understand why and how the battery discharges--which we do, since it has such a strong influence on seasonal climate—we have to dig into the complicated stuff. As the quote usually attributed to Albert Einstein says, \"Scientific explanations [theories] should be as simple as possible...but not simpler.\"    Submitted by   on Fri, 06/21/2024 - 14:10 In reply to   by  Thank you for this! There has been much made of La Nina and El Nino as \"drivers of climate extremes\" in the news since the really big 1997-98 El Nino event.   Yet the news rarely explains what the 2 phases mean or involve, beyond being shorter term 'cool weather' and 'warm weather' climate phases.  The battery charge and discharge analogy seemed quite apt and very easy for any lay person to grasp, if not a little too conveniently simple. As far as 'heat discharge' is concerned, a simple volcano analogy makes some sense.  But then that begs the question, which might not strictly be an ENSO phase question, whether the equilibrium between cool Ninas and warm Ninos is shifting, as we've seen warmer oceans even through the recent \"moderately strong\" 2020-23 La Nina.  (After all, hearing stories of batteries overheating with analogies of ...suns going supernova can't be too far off at this rate...  I digress) Surely we need more understanding of those dynamic, complicated atmospheric processes.  A simple theory would be wonderful - there is much to comb through to, to begin to get close to having an idea of what's going on for the average lay person.  But it is 100% worth it for those who want to know.

Your comment is a good reminder for those of us outside the tropics that for those actually in the tropics, the impacts of El Niño and La Niña are more consistent and potentially severe than they are in the subtropics and mid-latitudes, where the influence of El Niño and La Niña is weaker.

You can look back at   to see the patterns during 20 of the strongest La Niñas on record. That's total precip, though, not distinguishing rain from snow. Sometime before winter, we will probably do a La Niña version of  , so stay tuned. You also have to keep in mind that long-term global warming is reducing snowfall in many U.S. locations; a percentage of winter precip that would have historically fallen as snow now falls as rain. So, it's possible that even if La Niña did historically tend to produce snowier winters in a particular place, it's impact may be more muted in today's warming climate.

One key point in her article was that weaker El Niños tend to be closer to the Central Pacific types and stronger El Niños tend to be closer to Eastern Pacific types. So I wouldn't necessarily classify the 6 strong events as CP events (with the caveat that, as I noted, there is nuance here) As for variables following the trends of the past two events, it's hard to compare when the sample size is n=2. The other difficulty is the impact the above-average ocean temperatures worldwide might be having as well.  Submitted by   on Tue, 06/25/2024 - 10:53 In reply to   by  This was an interesting study done at one of the Univ of Californias.

If the trend of warming seas continues, it could impact marine ecosystems in both Poland and Scotland, as well as our weather patterns.

I haven't seen that report, but I can confirm that El Nino likely had little to do with flooding in East Africa in May. The El Nino impact in Eastern Africa is strongest over the October–January period. Regarding Beryl, it's really difficult to attribute the strength of a single storm, and ENSO is currently neutral and so does not have much influence on global atmospheric circulation.  Submitted by   on Mon, 07/08/2024 - 11:04 In reply to   by  July NMME continues the trend of a weakening La Nina Submitted by   on Mon, 07/08/2024 - 00:08 We have seen and extreme low river flow in the last 6 years.

The tropical Pacific Ocean reflected neutral conditions—neither El Niño nor La Niña—in September. Forecasters continue to favor La Niña later this year, with an approximately   it will develop in September–November. The probability of La Niña is a bit lower than last month, though, and it’s likely to be a weak event. La Niña is the cool phase of the  , a pattern of alternating warmer (El Niño) and cooler surface waters in the tropical Pacific. Rising warm air in the tropics is what drives global atmospheric circulation, and therefore the  , storm tracks, and resulting  . ENSO’s varying sea surface temperature changes where the   occurs, hence  . ENSO is predictable several months in advance, and when you couple that predictability with our knowledge of how it changes global patterns, you get an early picture of potential upcoming weather and climate patterns. Let’s take a spin through recent conditions in the tropical Pacific. The threshold for La Niña is a sea surface temperature in the   region in the central equatorial Pacific that is equal to or more than 0.5 °C below the long-term average. (Currently,   is 1991–2020.) The most recent   of the temperature difference from average in the Niño-3.4 region was -0.3 °C, and the September average was also -0.3 °C. Hurricane Helene’s devastating impacts on the Asheville, NC, region affected  —see the footnote for details on our new data sources this month. Michelle and CPC’s Caihong Wen did extensive testing and determined that the temporary replacements have historically been very close to the ones we usually use, so we’re confident that ENSO-neutral conditions are still in place. This animation shows weekly sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean compared to average from July 1–September 29, 2024. Orange and red areas were warmer than average; blue areas were cooler than average. Warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the key ENSO-monitoring region of the tropical Pacific (outlined with black box) have started to be replaced by cooler-than-average waters—a sign that La Niña may be brewing. NOAA Climate.gov animation, based on Coral Reef Watch Data and maps from     in its own browser window.  There has been a region of cooler-than-average water in the central-eastern tropical Pacific in recent weeks, as you can see above, but it’s not quite crossing the threshold. Some aspects of the tropical atmosphere are still reflecting neutral, too. There was a region of stronger-than-average trade winds in the east-central tropical Pacific and a little bit of reduced rainfall over the central Pacific, but overall, no strong, distinct pattern of stronger-than-average trade winds or increased rainfall over Indonesia as we’d expect during an established La Niña. In fact, a couple weeks of average to weaker-than-average trade winds during September allowed the surface to warm a bit. If it seems like we’ve been stuck here in neutral for longer than we expected—we have! Last winter, models were predicting that La Niña would develop rapidly after the end of El Niño 2023–24. So what happened? Why are we still waiting? Didn’t I just say ENSO is predictable? Not exactly a  . ENSO is predictable, but only in the big picture, meaning seasonal averages or longer. The signals that tell us that El Niño or La Niña are on the way, such as a large amount of cooler or warmer water under the ocean surface, or a particularly strong, long-lasting shift in the trade winds, are reliable indicators. Also, our computer climate models, which look at current conditions and make predictions based on mathematical and physical equations, are pretty good, especially after the   (a time of year when predictions are especially difficult). However, small,  , such as the weaker equatorial trade winds that occurred during September, can’t be predicted more than a couple of weeks (at best) in advance.  They tend to have a disproportionate impact during borderline, more marginal situations when we are hovering near our ENSO thresholds.  These small fluctuations can tip the scales one way or the other. In this case, they’ve added up to a slower and weaker La Niña development. That said, many of our models are holding steady for La Niña to develop shortly. Line graph showing observed and predicted temperatures (black line) in the key ENSO-monitoring region of the tropical Pacific from early 2024 though spring 2025. The gray shading shows the range of temperatures predicted by individual models that are part of the North American Multi Model Ensemble (NMME, for short). Most of the shading appears below the dashed blue line by the fall, meaning most models predict that temperature in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific will be cooler than average by at least 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit)—the La Niña threshold. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data provided by Climate Prediction Center.  Forecasters have nudged the overall chance that La Niña will develop down a bit from last month, though. That means that, while La Niña is still favored, we’re less confident in La Niña emerging. Out of the three climate possibilities—La Niña, El Niño, and neutral—forecasts say that La Niña conditions are the most likely for the September–November season (blue bar over the SON label, 60% chance). NOAA Climate Prediction Center image.   Also, if La Niña forms, it’s very likely this will be a weak event, with a maximum between -0.9 and -0.5 °C, in line with model predictions. In the historical record, which starts in 1950, only four La Niña events have formed this late in the year, with two forming in September–November and two in October–December. These were all either weak or on the border between weak and moderate.  ENSO events are strongest in the winter, so there’s less time for this La Niña to grow from where we are now. The strength of an ENSO event, as gauged by its sea surface temperature departures, matters because stronger events change the atmospheric circulation more consistently, leading to more consistent impacts on temperature, rainfall, and other patterns.  A weaker event makes it more likely that other weather and climate phenomena could play the role of spoiler.  However, even a weak La Niña can factor into seasonal outlooks, because it can still nudge the global atmosphere. Next month, Nat will review what the models have to say about winter conditions, including how much they reflect La Niña’s expected impacts. Stay tuned here at the ENSO Blog—we’re all treat, no trick! In a recent Yale CC article  A spike that lasts a year or more is not consistent with the secular, monotonic rise in temperature predicted by a GHG model. It could be a tipping point perhaps, but if the spike disappears, that does not make sense. So that leaves an El Nino or ocean-cycle cause, Hunga-Tonga response, or an aerosol change as has been suggested. No way is it a sunspot-related event IMO. As Gavin said, it's somewhat embarrassing not understanding the cause, but that's really in the context of not having a consensus to the cause of El Nino events in the first place. Or having an agreement of whether the AMO is an oscillation or not. It's good that Gavin Schmidt is honest in his appraisal of the difficulty in pinning this all down. Submitted by   on Thu, 10/10/2024 - 14:10 Nature certainly can humble us in many ways, and the climate system often throws us curveballs (so it's not just for us ENSO forecasters and researchers). I agree that the magnitude of recent heat is still a mystery, but I disagree with the statement that \"A spike that lasts a year or more is not consistent with the secular, monotonic rise in temperature predicted by a GHG model.\" The rise of global mean temperatures in response to GHG forcing does not preclude the competing or reinforcing effects of internal variability or other radiative forcing agents, which could last days or decades. So, I agree that it's unsettling that we don't have a definitive answer for this spike, but that shortcoming doesn't necessarily say anything about consistency or inconsistency with the influence of GHG forcing on global mean temperature.  Submitted by   on Thu, 10/10/2024 - 17:18 In reply to   by  Noticed that in the interview article not one mention of the words CO2, GHG, greenhouse gas, climate change, or global warming as a mechanism for the conspicuous heat spike of the last 2 years. This could be overlooked by the author of the article, but the implication conveyed by Gavin Schmidt is that they're looking at something else, including ENSO. Yet it's not ENSO alone as observed with the large spikes in the AMO for the Atlantic and the IOD for the Indian ocean.

What do you think the odds are of a Central Based  Modoki type La Nina?    Submitted by   on Thu, 10/10/2024 - 15:24 I cannot speak for Emily, but I can respond anyway. :-) The relationship between ENSO strength and east versus central/Modoki is stronger for El Nino than for La Nina. La Nina tends to be centered farther west than El Nino in general, so most La Ninas are \"Modoki-like\" to some extent (see  ). That said, it's still possible this event could be centered farther east or west than normal.

These differences in data/methods can lead to differences in global average temperature, but these differences are usually pretty small. To me, it looks like the global average temperature is pretty consistent among datasets, although there are small differences (like UAH had September 2024 as the warmest and ERA5 had it as the second warmest).

Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred. Since the middle of the 20  century, annual emissions from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 36.6 billion tons in 2023 according to the  . Carbon cycle experts estimate that natural “sinks”—processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere—on land and in the ocean absorbed the equivalent of about half of the carbon dioxide we emitted each year in the 2011-2020 decade. Because we put more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases every year. The more we overshoot what natural processes can remove in a given year, the faster the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide rises. In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.8± 0.1 ppm per year. Over the next half century, the annual growth rate tripled, reaching 2.4 ppm per year during the 2010s.

Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth’s surface and re-release it in all directions—including back toward Earth’s surface. Without carbon dioxide, Earth’s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing. By adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are supercharging the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations by the NOAA Global Monitoring Lab, in 2021 carbon dioxide alone was responsible for about two-thirds of the   of all human-produced greenhouse gases. Another reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called  .

The warm episodes (interglacials) began with a small increase in incoming sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere due to variations in Earth’s orbit around the Sun and its axis of rotation. (For more details, see the “Milankovitch cycles and ice ages” section of our   article.) That little bit of extra sunlight caused a little bit of warming. As the oceans warmed, they outgassed carbon dioxide—like a can of soda going flat in the heat of a summer day. The extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere greatly amplified the initial, solar-driven warming. Based on air bubbles trapped in mile-thick   and other paleoclimate evidence, we know that during the ice age cycles of the past million years or so, atmospheric carbon dioxide never exceeded 300 ppm. Before the Industrial Revolution started in the mid-1700s, atmospheric carbon dioxide was 280 ppm or less. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO  in parts per million (ppm) for the past 800,000 years based on ice-core data (light purple line) compared to 2022 concentration (bright purple dot). The peaks and valleys in the line show ice ages (low CO ) and warmer interglacials (higher CO ). Throughout that time, CO  was never higher than 300 ppm (light purple dot, between 300,000 and 400,000 years ago). The increase over the last 60 years is 100 times faster than previous natural increases. In fact, on the geologic time scale, the increase from the end of the last ice age to the present (dashed purple line) looks virtually instantaneous. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov based on data from Lüthi, et al., 2008, via NOAA NCEI Paleoclimatology Program. By the time continuous observations began at Mauna Loa Volcanic Observatory in 1958, global atmospheric carbon dioxide was already 315 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in human history. In fact, the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide amounts were this high was  , during the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period, when global surface temperature was 4.5–7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (2.5–4 degrees Celsius) warmer than during the pre-industrial era. Sea level was at least 16 feet higher than it was in 1900 and possibly as much as 82 feet higher. If global energy demand continues to grow rapidly and we meet it mostly with fossil fuels, human emissions of carbon dioxide could reach 75 billion tons per year or more by the end of the century. Atmospheric carbon dioxide could be 800 ppm or higher—conditions not seen on Earth for close to 50 million years.

Erupciones grandes y violentas pueden igualar la tasa de emisiones de los seres humanos en las pocas horas que duran, pero son muy poco frecuentes y muy breves en comparación a las emisiones humanas anuales. De hecho, varios estados de los Estados Unidos emiten individualmente más dióxido de carbono en un año que todos los volcanes del planeta combinados. En la escala de emisiones de dióxido de carbono, las fuentes humanas superan por lejos a los volcanes. Ilustración del NOAA Climate.gov por Emily Greenhalgh. Las actividades humanas—principalmente la quema de carbón y otros combustibles fósiles, pero también la producción de cemento, la deforestación y otros cambios en el paisaje—emitieron aproximadamente 40 mil millones de toneladas métricas de dióxido de carbono en 2015. Desde el comienzo de la Revolución Industrial, más de 2 billones de toneladas métricas de dióxido de carbono han sido lanzadas a la atmósfera producto de la actividad humana, según el Proyecto Global del Carbón. Desde el comienzo de la Revolución Industrial, las emisiones humanas de dióxido de carbón provenientes de los combustibles fósiles y de la producción de cemento (línea verde) han aumentado más de 35 mil millones de toneladas métricas  por año. Mientras que los volcanes (línea púrpura) producen menos de mil millones de toneladas métricas anualmente. Gráfico del NOAA Climate.gov basado en datos del Centro de Análisis de Información de Dióxido de Carbono (CDIAC, siglas en inglés) del Laboratorio Nacional Oak Ridge del Departamento de Energía y Burton et al., 2013. Los volcanes emiten dióxido de carbono de dos maneras: durante las erupciones y a través del magma subterráneo. El dióxido de carbono del magma subterráneo es liberado a través de grietas, rocas y suelos porosos, además del agua que alimenta lagos volcánicos y manantiales termales. Las estimaciones de las emisiones de dióxido de carbono globales producidas por volcanes deben tomar en cuenta tanto las fuentes en erupción como aquellas que no lo están. Gran parte del dióxido de carbono liberado los volcanes se emite a través de la desgasificación del magma subterráneo cuando el volcán no está en erupción.

En un artículo científico de 2011, el investigador del Servicio Geológico de los Estados Unidos, Terry Gerlach, resumió cinco estimaciones anteriores de las tasas de emisión global de dióxido de carbono volcánico que habían sido publicadas entre 1991 y 1998. Estas estimaciones incluyeron estudios que databan de la década de 1970 y que se basaron en una gran variedad de mediciones, como muestreo directo y teledetección satelital. Las estimaciones globales se ubicaron en un rango de aproximadamente 0.3 ± 0.15 mil millones de toneladas métricas de dióxido de carbono por año, lo cual significa que las emisiones humanas de dióxido de carbono fueron más de 90 veces mayores que las emisiones globales de dióxido de carbono provenientes de volcanes. El 18 de mayo de 1980, el Monte Saint Helens sufrió una erupción explosiva, emitiendo una columna de cenizas, vapor y gases de hasta 60,000 pies por sobre el nivel del mar. Durante aproximadamente nueve horas las emisiones de dióxido de carbono del volcán podrían haber alcanzado las emisiones humanas, pero erupciones tan masivas son raras y pasajeras. Foto del Servicio Geológico de los Estados Unidos por Robert Krimmel. \n  En 2013, otro grupo de científicos—Michael Burton, Georgina Sawyer y Domenico Granieri—publicaron una estimación actualizada usando más datos sobre las emisiones de dióxido de carbono del magma de superficie, que estuvieron disponibles años después de la última estimación global. Si bien los autores identificaron un rango amplio de variabilidad en las estimaciones, concluyeron que la mejor estimación general era de aproximadamente 0,6 mil millones de toneladas métricas de dióxido de carbono por año. Si bien es más alta que la estimación de Gerlach, la cantidad sigue siendo sólo una fracción de la producción de dióxido de carbono proveniente de las actividades humanas. Gerlach comentó en un correo electrónico: \"Tomado al pie de la letra, sus resultados significan que el CO  antropogénico excede el CO  volcánico global por al menos un factor de 60 veces\". Ocasionalmente, las erupciones son lo suficientemente potentes como para liberar dióxido de carbono a una tasa que iguala o incluso excede la tasa global de emisiones humanas durante unas pocas horas. Por ejemplo, Gerlach estimó que las erupciones del Monte Saint Helens (1980) y Pinatubo (1991) liberaron dióxido de carbono en una escala similar a la producción humana durante casi nueve horas. Las emisiones humanas de dióxido de carbono continúan día tras día, mes tras mes y año tras año. La actividad volcánica actual puede parecer menor en comparación a las emisiones de dióxido de carbono que estamos generando con la quema de combustibles fósiles para producir energía. Pero en el transcurso del tiempo geológico, los volcanes han ocasionalmente contribuido al calentamiento global con la producción de cantidades significativas de dióxido de carbono y otros gases de efecto invernadero. Por ejemplo, algunos geólogos plantean la hipótesis de que hace 250 millones de años una extensa inundación de lava emanó de manera continua desde la tierra en Siberia, tal vez por cientos de miles de años. Esta erupción a gran escala, y de larga duración, probablemente elevó las temperaturas globales lo suficiente como para causar una de las mayores extinciones en la historia de nuestro planeta. La actividad volcánica actual no ocurre en una escala tan masiva. Hoy en día, más que calentar el clima global, las erupciones volcánicas frecuentemente tienen un efecto opuesto. Eso es porque el dióxido de carbono no es lo único que los volcanes inyectan en la atmósfera. Incluso las erupciones pequeñas con frecuencia producen cenizas volcánicas y partículas de aerosol. Tomada por astronautas del Transbordador Espacial a principios de agosto de 1991, esta foto del pliegue de la Tierra muestra una doble capa de partículas de aerosol volcánico (interpretación de Self et al., 1999) que se propagó por la estratósfera tras la catastrófica erupción del Monte Pinatubo. Rodeando el globo a altitudes incluso mayores que aquellas de las nubes de las tormentas eléctricas, las partículas reflejaban tanta luz solar entrante que las temperaturas globales de la superficie se enfriaron durante dos años. Foto cortesía del Portal de Fotografía Astronauta de la Tierra. Ya sean producto de erupciones pequeñas o grandes, los aerosoles volcánicos reflejan la luz solar de regreso al espacio, enfriando el clima global. La erupción de 1815 del Monte Tambora produjo suficientes cenizas y aerosoles como para suspender el verano en Europa y América del Norte en 1816. Boden, T.A., Marland, G., Andres, R.J. (2015).

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on   from the National Centers for Environmental Information. Given the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth’s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it means a significant increase in accumulated heat. That extra heat is driving regional and seasonal  , reducing   and  , intensifying   and changing habitat ranges for   and  —expanding some and shrinking others.  As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions. In addition, it's clear that the rate of warming over the past few decades is much faster than the average rate since the start of the 20th century. Trends in annual surface temperature in the past few decades (1994-2023, bottom) compared to the trend since the start of the 20th century (1901-2023, top). Recent warming is much faster than the longer-term average, with some locations warming by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic, where the loss of reflective ice and snow amplifies the rate of warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based on data provided by NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. The concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100°F (55°C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget—how much sunlight Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat—over time. To calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track   in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies—the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they Across inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our  According to the   from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2023 ranked among the 7 warmest for that month, and the months in the second half of the year (June-December) were each their hottest on record.

For more regional details and 2023 climate statistics, see the   from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.  Though warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's  the combined land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.11° Fahrenheit (0.06° Celsius) per decade since 1850, or about 2° F in total. The rate of warming since 1982 is more than three times as fast: 0.36° F (0.20° C) per decade. According to the latest Synthesis Report ( ) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there is no debate about the cause of this warming trend: Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020. In the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report on the Physical Basis of Climate Change, experts summarized the relative influence of all things known to affect Earth's average surface temperature: The   range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C [2.01 ˚F]. Over this period, it is   that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability changed it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C. The amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities—burning fossil fuels and to a lesser extent clearing forests—add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon ( ) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide amounts increase each year. \n According to the  , if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,  models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20  century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.

For climate modeler Lisa Sloan and paleobotanist Scott Wing, collaboration also involved tears, a dartboard, and a rattlesnake beheading. It may sound unconventional, but their collaboration has shed light on one of the warmest—and most puzzling—periods from our planet’s past. Around 56 million years ago, Earth’s temperatures spiked. That period of time is known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM for short. It was one of the   in Earth history. Global temperatures likely rose by 9 to 14°F (5 to 8°C) for thousands of years. Geologists and paleontologists have known about the high temperatures for decades, but questions remain. How did the spike affect life on Earth? Could it happen again? Deep ocean temperatures were generally high throughout the Paleocene and Eocene, with a particularly warm spike at the boundary between the two geological epochs around 56 million years ago.

Looking at scenes of cavemen and other prehistoric life, she knew what she wanted to do when she grew up: make dioramas. By the time she went in college, her ambitions had shifted to medicine until, enrolled as a pre-med major, she took a geology class. She fell for ancient rocks the same way she had fallen for dioramas. She also took a computer class. It was the era of punch cards and hours of computer downtime, and one day, she found a library book on DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). “It was for an early climate model,” she recalls. “I was captivated.” Left: Modeled climate for the PETM, adapted from Sloan's 1990 paper in Geology. Right: Lisa Sloan, photo courtesy University of California, Santa Cruz. Bringing her cat along for overnight stints in the computer lab, Sloan keyed every line of that inch-and-a-half-thick DARPA book’s code into the university computer. “Computing was so primitive then, it was like taking a butter knife to surgery.” Even so, she had found her career. Soon after, one of her professors suggested they work together on a literal hot topic: the Eocene Epoch. Prior research on the early Eocene indicated that global temperature at the time was “equable,” or steady throughout the year, with few strong highs or lows. Sloan and her adviser ran a simulation and got a different result for the mid-latitudes of North America and Siberia. “We found that, no, it was not equable,” Sloan says. “It was cold in winter and hot in summer.” In 1990, they submitted their paper for publication, with Sloan as the lead author. “  was, and still is, the premier publication for papers like this. I didn’t even have a Ph.D. yet, but I got this paper published in  .” It was June 1990, she recalls, and she was on top of the world. “And then this guy I’d never met, he wrote a stinging rebuke.” Scott Wing grew up in North Carolina, and like Sloan, he spent his childhood fascinated by our planet’s past. When he had free time in high school, he signed up for a college-level course at Duke University on human evolution. Impressed by the high school student, the professor suggested that Wing try some hands-on paleontological fieldwork. With his professor’s letter of introduction, Wing finally found someone willing to let a 17-year-old fossil hunter tag along, and in the summer of 1972, he spent several weeks digging fossils in Wyoming. Wing excavates fossils in Wyoming every summer. Photo courtesy Scott Wing. At first, Wing now reflects, fossils were just fun, cool prizes to dig out of the ground. His interest in what they could reveal about ancient climates came later. “I got interested in Mesozoic and Cenozoic plants because I was interested in climate change around that time. I got interested in climate change because I was interested in mammals. I wondered why they were evolving and changing shape,” Wing explains. “A good way to figure out climate is to study fossil plants.” Wing studies the rapid spread and diversification of flowering plants that occurred from the late Cretaceous Period through the Eocene Epoch, roughly 70 million to 50 million years ago. Wyoming, where he digs fossils yearly, was home to palm trees and crocodiles around that time. In fact, so was the Arctic. By the time he read Sloan’s paper in  , Wing was an established scientist at the Smithsonian Institution. He knew his fossil plants. And he knew her paper had to be wrong. Sloan and her adviser finished their paper with a caveat: “[I]f unequivocable data indicating warmth well within continental boundaries at high or middle latitudes can be found, these data would be crucial and would indicate either a fundamental flaw in our knowledge of the climate system or a lack of understanding of the factors that have influenced climate in Earth history.” In his rebuttal, Wing quoted the caveat, then wrote, “Such data already exist in the paleontological literature,” He included a table of specific examples.  a fossil crocodile collected from the Green River Formation in southwestern Wyoming, is an example of warmer conditions in North America during the Eocene Epoch. This specimen is now on display in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago.   by Flickr user James St. John. Sloan went from elation at publishing a paper in a prestigious journal before she completed her Ph.D. to wondering if her career was over before she completed her Ph.D. “I cried my eyes out for days,” she admits. A buddy wrote a fake response to Wing’s rebuttal—presumably something unprintable in the peer-reviewed literature—and suggested she mount Wing’s paper on a dartboard. She took his advice. Sloan knew about the fossil record of a much warmer climate during the early Eocene. She simply hadn’t been convinced that year-round warmth was the only possible interpretation. Beyond that, she explains, “I was trying to show that this is what the state-of-the-art computer models say: ‘We have a problem here.’”  published Wing’s rebuttal and Sloan’s response to it in May 1991. In October of that year, Sloan attended the Geological Society of America’s annual meeting, in San Diego. At lunch one day with a couple colleagues, she found herself sitting across the table from Wing. “We jousted a bit,” Sloan says. But to her amazement, she realized she didn’t actually hate him after meeting him in person. After the meeting, she remembers, “I really dug into my research.” With computer advances in the early 1990s, models got better. A little. “It went from going into surgery with a butter knife to going into surgery with a crappy steak knife,” Sloan says dryly. She also found she could turn to Wing for verification of her research. “Scott and I started checking each other’s work.” Plants near rivers and lakes can drop their leaves into the water where rapid burial might preserve those leaves in the fossil record.   by Flickr user Matt Dean. Trees commonly line rivers, but a short distance away, plant life may be completely different—and unlikely to leave any fossils. So, although fossils provide glimpses of ancient climates and landscapes, they don’t provide a complete picture. Climate models can fill in the gaps left by Earth’s incomplete fossil record.   from Wikimedia Commons. In 1994, Sloan published another paper in  This time, she described the results of two simulations of climate conditions during the PETM: one with six times Earth’s current level of carbon dioxide, and another with two times the current level of carbon dioxide plus a massive North American lake. Fossils had shown Wing and his colleagues that an expansive lake system once existed around the present-day Green River in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado Higher carbon dioxide concentrations and a big lake system did the trick. Modeled temperatures in North America and Siberia were higher than in her 1990 simulation, and consistent with the abundance of warm-climate fossils from the PETM. “That’s one of my favorite papers ever,” she says. Sloan and Wing were good friends by the time he decided to take a sabbatical from the Smithsonian in 1997–1998. Now a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Sloan invited Wing and his family to spend the year in Santa Cruz. Wing and Sloan taught a seminar together. This time it was Wing who scrambled up the learning curve. At the end of the seminar, one of Sloan’s students told him, “We are going to miss you, Scott. You ask all the dumb questions that we’d like to ask.” While Wing was on sabbatical, Sloan joined Wing’s crew for fieldwork at Polecat Bench, Wyoming. Here, Wing stands in front of the newly christened expedition vehicle, in between a grad student (left) and a local rancher (right) and the rancher’s excellent field dog, Pepper (far right). Despite having to help push their subpar SUV out of a dry wash at one point, Sloan still has fond memories of the fossil dig. Photo courtesy Lisa Sloan. Sloan once joined Wing and his students for fieldwork at Polecat Bench, Wyoming . Field conditions in the Bighorn Basin were primitive. Participants had their own sleeping tents, and each morning, everybody gathered around the cook tent. There was no shower, and toilet facilities consisted of a shovel for digging oneself a deeply personal hole. But what Sloan remembers most was the snake. “One morning, somebody heard a rattlesnake,” Sloan recalls. “Everybody looked at Scott. He nodded, picked up the shovel and Whack!” Wing beheaded the rattlesnake with a single shovel blow. “I didn’t see it coming because he’s such a mild-mannered person,” Sloan says. “Never underestimate a paleontologist.” Models used to simulate ancient climates have improved since 1990, offering better spatial resolution and a much better fit with the fossil evidence. It’s pretty clear, says Wing, that a spike in greenhouse gases during the PETM caused the spike in global temperatures, but the precise combination of gases—carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor—is still under debate. Wing thinks that the source was mostly carbon dioxide. He suspects that some came from volcanoes, and some from organic carbon. Sloan seconds volcanoes, but adds the possibility of methane released from shallow, icy sediments as seas warmed. A frozen methane clathrate serves as a small apartment complex for methane ice worms. Thawing clathrates produce a  .   by Flickr user NOAA Photo Library. Whatever the exact sequence of events that led to the PETM warming, the fossil record documents big impacts to plants and animals.   hampered shell building, and roughly half of the   living on the bottom of the deep sea went extinct. In places like Wyoming, the dramatic temperature changes wiped out some plant populations, and some mammal species turned puny. Plants suffered in other ways. Leaf fossils from the PETM show increased insect damage. This might be down to the fact that lots of bugs like heat. It might also be down to the fact that higher carbon dioxide levels can spur plant growth, but the faster-growing plants are often less nutritious. The average bug probably had to eat more to survive. Leaves have been on insect menus for millions of years.   by Flickr user Sandy Sarsfield. Fossils frequently preserve insect damage to leaves, including this specimen from the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Photo courtesy Scott Wing. In a   in 2016, Wing explained that the PETM likely resulted from the release of about 5,000 billion tons of carbon over several thousand years. That’s about the amount of carbon that we will release if we burn Earth’s entire reservoir of fossil fuels. Humans haven’t burned the entire reservoir yet, but we are going through it at a much faster rate than anything that happened 56 million years ago. “This is like the PETM on steroids,” he told the audience. Then he pointed out something even more sobering about the PETM: The warming lasted for about 150,000 years. Wing discusses the lingering effects to greenhouse gas emissions at the  . Screen capture from YouTube. Looking back on decades of research, Sloan admits to feeling frustrated, discouraged that models haven’t made more progress in the past three decades. Retired now from the University of California, she jokes that she’s “in science rehab.” She still has fond memories of working with her one-time nemesis. “It’s amazing how two people who were so at odds became such good friends.” Wing still works at the Smithsonian, in an office that uses an old fossil leaf exhibit display as a coffee table. He adds, “This is how science is supposed to work. We disagreed. We argued. We discussed. We kept each other honest. But we didn’t let the disagreement stay personal, and the result was we each improved what we were doing. We both have enough sense to respect the other’s opinion. That makes it easy to be friends, too.” Archibald, J.D., Wing, S.L. (1991). Comment: “Equable” climates during Earth history?  , 19(5):539-540.

These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. .  While not as popular as “polar vortex,” oceanic Kelvin waves did break into media reports in early 2014 ( ,  ,  ) when a really strong wave traveled eastward across the tropical Pacific Ocean.  In this post, we’ll go into a little more detail on what these waves are and why they are important in ENSO prediction.   And if Kelvin waves ever get as popular as the polar vortex some day, we are confident our readers will be able to describe them in a way that doesn’t generate a heavy   from scientists.      The waves that most of us are familiar with are the waves at the beach—waves that endlessly curl and crash on the shore. But the ocean and atmosphere also have what are called “planetary waves”—waves of immense scale. Kelvin waves are a kind of planetary wave. Unlike the waves you see at the beach, Kelvin waves do not curl over and then crash.  They are more like the waves in your bathtub, which slowly slosh around. They don’t break, but they still have broad peaks and valleys that change the depth of the water (the ocean equivalent is “sea surface height”). The Kelvin waves that are relevant to ENSO only move   and   (1). Like all planetary waves, the geographic extent of an equatorial Kelvin wave is huge, often stretching over much of the Pacific Ocean (thousands of miles). Equatorial Kelvin waves have two  , which can lead to very different changes in subsurface and sea surface temperature (SSTs) in the eastern tropical Pacific: (A)  :  Normally, winds blow from east to west across the tropical Pacific, which piles up warm water in the western Pacific. A weakening of these winds starts the surface layer of water cascading eastward.  The thick warm layer sloshes east, pushing down the   as it goes, thus we call this a “downwelling” wave.  The thermocline is the boundary between the warmer, near surface mixed layer and colder deeper water (4).  Because of this downward push as the wave travels eastward, it is harder for the colder, deeper water to affect the surface so near-surface temperatures are often  . This will often (not always) warm the surface temperatures and plant the seeds for an El Niño (5). (B)  :  After the downwelling part of the wave goes by, we sometimes see a rebound or upwelling where there was once downwelling (6).  Here, the colder water at depth upwells and the thermocline comes closer to the surface.  We often will see   temperatures near or at the surface. You can see both downwelling and upwelling phases in this diagram below, which shows the average temperature of the top 300m of the ocean along the equator (7). When the warm upper layer is thick, this average temperature is warmer, so this kind of diagram is convenient. After it gets started, a Kelvin wave takes 2-3 months to cross the tropical Pacific, which gives us some lead time to anticipate a possible El Niño event. We saw a big downwelling Kelvin wave in March/April 2014 (also see this  ), but then we saw an upwelling phase go through in June/July, which helped to reverse and cool temperatures in the eastern Pacific. The subsurface temperature changes are not always perfectly equal and opposite.   Just because there is a strong downwelling phase does not mean there will be a strong upwelling phase (6). Equatorial sub-surface temperature anomalies (averaged from 0-300 meters depth) shown for each longitude across the Pacific Ocean (see x-axis).  Time is shown on the y-axis from mid-January 2014 (top edge) to mid January 2015 (bottom edge).  Red shading shows where temperatures were above-average, and blue shading shows where they were below average.  Data is from the NCEP   with anomalies defined with respect to the average over 1981-2010.  Figure is from NOAA Climate Prediction Center. During December 2014 and January 2015, we saw a weak upwelling Kelvin wave move across the tropical Pacific (white shading), which resulted in cooling of the subsurface tropical Pacific ocean.  Will this be the final nail in the coffin for El Niño in winter of 2014-15?  It is possible, so stay tuned to future  .  Going forward, we still need to continue to monitor the Pacific for future downwelling Kelvin waves which may increase the risk of El Niño forming in 2015 (see latest  ).  (1) At this point, our more inquisitive readers might ask themselves, what happens after this wave hits the coast of South America?  Well, they can bounce back (slightly off the equator) as a westward moving  .  Also, there is a second type of Kelvin wave in the ocean that is not as directly applicable to ENSO prediction, which is called a   that travels with the coast to its right in the Northern Hemisphere.  (2) At planetary scales, different forces dominate, and so we find these different classes of waves.  However, like any wave, planetary waves begin when the surface of a fluid is disturbed somehow. (3) The atmospheric Kelvin wave is often presented as   (CCKW) and is essentially similar to the atmospheric Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) except they move faster eastward and span shorter wave lengths (Kiladis et al., 2009). (4) The   is often defined by subsurface temperatures at 20°C.  Around the 20°C layer, ocean temperatures change rapidly (a strong temperature gradient).  On average, the thermocline is found at a deeper depth in the western Pacific and is closer to the surface in the eastern Pacific.  (5) The appearance of a downwelling Kelvin wave does not automatically mean an El Niño event is coming.  Sub-surface temperatures can get quite warm, but they do not necessarily manifest themselves at the surface of the ocean in a 1:1 fashion.  This is because it is “easier” to achieve large anomalies near the thermocline (a large temperature gradient can lead to big anomalies) and not necessarily right at the surface.  However, downwelling Kelvin waves are one sign of a possible El Niño and are why it is important to monitor below the surface of the ocean in addition to the surface.   (6)  There does not have to be a rebound upwelling wave. The waves entirely reflect the wind forcing: if the winds remain westerly, there will be no rebound. But it happens that typically westerly wind forcing (e.g. say from the MJO) is then followed by easterly anomalies. This process is entirely external to the ocean— ultimately, the ocean will respond to sustained wind forcing.  (7) Figure 1 is referred to as a  , which is an intimidating name, but it is a nice way to present information. The red shading is showing where the subsurface temperatures (from the ocean surface to 300 meters below the surface) are above average.  Blues show you where they are below average.  The nice thing about this diagram is that you can see the evolution and movement of these waves over time.  The upper-left to lower-right tilt of the temperature anomalies indicates   which is a sign of an oceanic Kelvin wave.  In contrast, you cannot see this movement when you examine a figure simply showing the subsurface ocean temperatures at one point in time (like the one below that is for 13 January 2015).  In a Hovmoller diagram, one of the axes (usually the vertical/y-axis) must be time. Depth-longitude section of the equatorial Pacific upper-ocean (0-300m) temperature anomalies centered on the pentad of 13 January 2015. The anomalies are averaged between 5S-5N and are based on departures from the 1981-2010 base period pentad means.   Kiladis, G. N., M. C. Wheeler, P. T. Haertel, K. H. Straub, and P. E.

Pp. 1062-1067.  Submitted by   on Sat, 04/11/2015 - 02:43 No, the tropical wind anomaly often changes on a quicker time scale than the 2-3 months it takes for the Kelvin wave to cross from western to eastern Pacific Ocean. That means that a spell of westerly wind anomalies may produce a downwelling phase of a Kelvin wave but end long before the wave makes it to the eastern part of the Pacific basin. Another spell of wind anomalies may sometimes occur while tthe Kelvin wave is still traveling eastward. This can trigger two separate Kelvin waves, or, if the wind spells are close together in time, the two spells of westerly wind anomalies may cause a single, but less sharp, downwelling Kelvin wave. The Kelvin waves are somewhat integrative--they may contain the effects of more than one spell of wind anomalies. The heat content of the subsurface waters is yet even more integrative, as it can be a result of more than one Kelvin wave at a time, such as two of them moving eastward but separated by 1000 km, being triggered by separate spells of wind anomaly. In addition to these shorter-lasting wind anomalies, long-lasting ones may come about once an El Nino is in full swing, and the ocean and atmosphere are well coupled. In that case there would be a longer period of steadier westerly wind anomalies due to the El Nino SST pattern, with wind blowing toward the location of maximum SST anomaly, typically in the Nino3 or Nino3.4 region, or even farther west over the dateline (as is the case in the current weak El Nino).

The answer for the tropics, at least, lies in changes to the equator-wide atmospheric circulation called the Walker Circulation. ", "content": "A blog   about monitoring and forecasting El Niño, La Niña, and their regional and global impacts...but sometimes about other climate phenomena that influence seasonal climate. The ENSO blog is written, edited, and moderated by Michelle L’Heureux (NOAA  ), Emily Becker ( ), Nat Johnson (NOAA  ), Tom DiLiberto (NOAA Office of Communications), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA  ), with periodic guest contributors. Ideas and explanations found in these posts should be attributed to the ENSO blog team, and not to NOAA (the agency) itself. These are blog posts, not official agency communications; if you quote from these posts or from the comments section, you should attribute the quoted material to the blogger or commenter, not to NOAA, CPC, or Climate.gov. Reading back over the many excellent (if I do say so myself) posts here at the ENSO blog, there have been several re-occurring themes—the biggest of which is that ENSO is not just an ocean phenomena but an ocean-atmospheric interaction. ENSO is no one-man act. If the ocean is Abbott, then the atmosphere is Costello; the ocean…Laverne, the atmosphere…Shirley; the ocean…Kanye, the atmosphere…Kim. And just like there would be no “Kimye” without Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, there is no ENSO event without both an atmospheric and oceanic response. We have previously touched on both aspects of this with a post on the   in the equatorial tropical Pacific Ocean (and the lack of gradient may be currently hindering the development of El Niño) as well as a post on the atmospheric response,  , where Emily Becker described the Southern Oscillation, especially the lack of typical response in that Southern Oscillation during June 2014. The focus of Emily’s post was on the Pacific Ocean atmospheric circulation, which we also call the Pacific “overturning cell” of an atmospheric “loop” called the  . The lower part of the loop flows east to west across much of the tropics near the surface; the upper part flows west to east at higher altitudes. Rising air in the west and sinking air in the east connect the flow in one big, continuous loop.  The post   describes how El Niño can affect this Pacific Ocean “overturning cell,” but unlike the popular saying in that desert southwest tourist town, what happens in the Pacific, does   just stay in the Pacific. ENSO can affect this atmospheric circulation, the Walker Circulation, over the entire tropics, impacting rainfall near the equator across multiple continents from Africa to Asia to South America! SO (pun intended) what does the entire Walker Circulation look like normally and how is it maintained? Figure 1 shows a simplified version of what the airflow over the equator looks like during the northern hemisphere winter, when ENSO events—El Niño and La Niña—are strongest. During neutral ENSO conditions, upward branches of the Walker Circulation rise strongly across the Maritime Continent and more weakly over eastern Africa and northern South America. These rising branches coincide with bull’s-eyes of precipitation during December through February. In contrast, downward branches of dry, stable air sink strongly over the eastern Pacific Ocean and more weakly over the Arabian Sea. Generalized Walker Circulation (December-February) during ENSO-neutral conditions.  Convection associated with rising branches of the Walker Circulation is found over the Maritime continent, northern South America, and eastern Africa. NOAA Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin.   What creates such a broad, large-scale circulation along the equator? Well, we already sorta went over that  , when talking about the importance of a sea surface temperature gradient. Thanks to Earth’s rotation on its axis, trade winds at the equator blow relentlessly from east to west, pushing sea water towards the west side of most ocean basins. The ocean water warms the entire way. The end result is relatively warmer surface water in the west and cooler surface waters in the east. Above this large pool of warm water (known to Earth scientists as the Pacific Warm Pool), air rises; above the cooler water in the east, air dries and settles near the surface. More widespread storminess and rising air motion are associated with a larger warm pool. Temperature contrasts between land and ocean also amplify the circulation (1). From Figure 1, we can see that the strongest upward branch of the Walker Circulation is located over the Maritime Continent, north of Australia. Weaker upward branches occur over less discernible warm pools, like the western Indian Ocean. The relative strength of the rising branch over South America is between those two extremes.  The Walker Circulation is basically a thermally (fancy word for temperature) direct circulation that relies on temperature differences to drive the rising and sinking branches. During ENSO events like El Niño and La Niña, this circulation gets either pushed or pulled around (El Niño) or sent into overdrive (La Niña) across the Pacific. We’ve   how during El Niño, this warm pool of water usually in the western Pacific Ocean begins to slosh to the east. As this warm pool moves east, the rising branch of the Pacific cell of the Walker Circulation follows, and boy does the rest of the Walker Circulation get shifted around (Figure 2). Generalized Walker Circulation (December-February) anomaly during El Niño events, overlaid on map of average sea surface temperature anomalies. Anomalous ocean warming in the central and eastern Pacific (orange) help to shift a rising branch of the Walker Circulation to east of 180°, while sinking branches shift to over the Maritime continent and northern South America. NOAA Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin.    Instead of strong rising motion over the Maritime Continent, upward flow weakens, and anomalous sinking motion occurs. The usual rising, moist air over South America is replaced by another anomalous sinking branch. The reversal of the circulation generally means that less rainfall than average dominates in these two areas during El Niño. In contrast, increased rising motion enhances rainfall over the central Pacific Ocean and even parts of equatorial eastern Africa. Meanwhile during La Niña events (Figure 3), when waters in the western Pacific are even warmer than normal and waters in the eastern Pacific are even colder, it is like someone turned the normal Walker Circulation “up to 11”.  Warm, moist air rises even more over the Maritime Continent and South America leading to above-average rainfall. In the eastern Pacific, where colder than average waters exist, an enhanced downward branch of the Walker Circulation helps to further reduce the region’s already small rainfall totals. Generalized Walker Circulation (December-February) anomaly during La Niña events, overlaid on map of average sea surface temperature anomalies. Anomalous ocean cooling (blue-green) in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean and warming over the western Pacific Ocean enhance the rising branch of the Walker circulation over the Maritime Continent and the sinking branch over the eastern Pacific Ocean. Enhanced rising motion is also observed over northern South America, while anomalous sinking motion is found over eastern Africa. NOAA Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin.    So in addition to ENSO impacts outside the  , ENSO events literally change the overturning circulation across the entire equatorial region. Of course, these patterns describe idealized or typical cases. As of early July, we were still waiting for the atmosphere to begin to reflect characteristics similar to Figure 2, if it does at all. If the atmosphere gets in gear, plenty of places could see changes in their usual rainfall patterns. But until then, we wait and see, trying to figure out what Mother Nature has up her sleeve. (1) Rising and sinking branches of the Walker Circulation generally occur over land as opposed to the ocean. This is due to a variety of other forcing mechanisms such as land-sea temperature contrasts where land areas warm and cool to a larger degree than the oceans nearby which is one reason why rising and sinking air is focused over land.

The challenges we confront are daunting, and they demand our collective resolve, but they also require us to continue to foster a sense of hope that propels us forward in the fight against one of the greatest existential threats of our time. “Let me share a few reasons for hope as we confront the climate crisis: “ : Science has never been more advanced. At NOAA, we have a deeper understanding of the Earth's systems than ever before, including how they act and interact. Innovations in renewable energy, carbon capture and sustainability are within our grasp. Thanks to historic investments in renewables and green technology, we have the resources and tools to make a real impact as we advance these solutions. “  The youth of today are the leaders of tomorrow. The enthusiasm, determination, knowledge, and activism of the younger generation have ignited a global movement demanding action on climate change. They remind us that the future is not lost and that we must strive for a world that is sustainable, just and equitable for all. “  COP28 is a testament to the power of global collaboration. Countries, organizations and thousands of individuals from around the world are convening to collectively address climate change. When we are committed together, our determination is uncompromising. “Hope is not a passive sentiment — it is a call to action. It reminds us that we are not helpless in the face of climate change. NOAA is in every community in the U.S., committed to working hand-in-hand with partners locally to build a ‘climate-ready nation’ and to sharing these best practices globally. No matter the need, people know they can turn to us for reliable, easy-to-use climate and extreme weather information to help make informed decisions that help save lives and livelihoods. “As the Administrator of NOAA, as a scientist and as a concerned citizen, I know that our agency is committed to continuing vital work in climate research and prediction, supporting sustainable practices and sharing knowledge with the world. And I know that it is equally essential for all of us to play our part. “In the spirit of international collaboration that powers COP28, let us remember that there is hope, and it’s a powerful force that drives change.

Over the last couple of months, we’ve been witnessing a tremendous   of one of the strongest El Niño events on record.  Sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the east-central equatorial Pacific Ocean have   over three degrees Fahrenheit since  !   The collapse of El Niño was well predicted because El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are almost always strongest during the Northern Hemisphere winter (1).  So, the seeds of destruction are sown into most El Niño events, but what exactly are they?  To understand the demise of El Niño, one needs to understand why and how ENSO evolves.   The entire ENSO lifecycle describes the birth, growth, maturation, and death of warm (El Niño) and cool (La Niña) phases.  When and why ENSO events get their start is still a bit of a mystery to us and is why forecasting remains challenging.  The death of ENSO is slightly more predictable, but still not preordained (2).  While ENSO events don’t always die in the spring or summer, there are times—like recently!—when it’s clear that a eulogy needs to be written.  Remember that one of the best crystal balls for the future state of ENSO is what is happening in the ocean.  Relative to the fast-changing atmospheric winds, we can literally see the evolution of ENSO in slow-mo because the ocean is tough to push around. One of the reasons we know the seeds of destruction have been planted is because we can watch them unfolding from below. The   and   that drift and dive several hundred meters below the surface show us what is happening not just   the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean, but what has been happening  the surface of the ocean. Recently, there are signs of El Niño’s demise at the surface of the ocean (a strip of   emerging), but for months we have been watching the equatorial Pacific cool down well below the surface (usually down to 1,000 feet below the surface).  You can see one nifty animation of the subsurface ocean in this recent   written by our fabulous editor Rebecca Lindsey (3). Temperature anomalies (departures from normal) across the depth of the equatorial Pacific Ocean (shown from the surface to 300 meters/984 feet below the surface). Red shading shows where temperatures are above average, and blue shading shows where the temperatures are below average. Animation by Climate.gov, based on NCEP GODAS data.  But why did this cooling of the subsurface ocean along the equator of the Pacific Ocean occur in the first place?  Not so long ago we were witnessing the entire tropical Pacific (surface and subsurface)  , with well above-average temperatures.  One theory is called the “recharge-discharge” mechanism (4).  Hang with me, and I promise I will explain, but not overload you (but if you want to be overloaded go straight to footnote #5).  Following La Niña and/or during Neutral conditions, heat builds up in the subsurface ocean around the equator over many months or even years (6).  Heat tends to increase initially in the western Pacific Ocean.  This is called the “ ” period (akin to recharging a battery!).   At some point, this built-up heat in the subsurface ocean becomes large and extensive enough that it begins to influence the surface of the ocean.   Generally, there is some trigger that instigates the spread of above-average temperatures across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, such as a strong westerly wind burst (7).    occurs when above-average surface temperatures are observed across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean.   As El Niño matures, the warmer than average waters in the upper layers of the equatorial Pacific Ocean drain away from the equator and toward the off-equatorial regions (8).  This is called the “ ” period (9). Why does this discharging occur?  Without getting into math that might make your head spin, during El Niño the sea level is higher than average in the central and eastern Pacific, and the winds are anomalously westerly.  These conditions are not normal and so an ocean current arises in order to try to bring everything back in balance. This ocean current moves heat away from the equator (“Sverdrup transport” if you want to impress your friends). To the north of the equator, this current moves northward and to the south of the equator, it moves southward.  With the near-surface currents pulling water away from the equator, what then happens on the equator?  Basically, cooler water from the deeper depths of the ocean moves upward, so it is closer to the surface.   Sometimes (not always), the discharging is enough that the equatorial Pacific cools down to the point that a La Niña event occurs, as reflected in below-average temperatures across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean.  After this the heating cycle starts anew.  Go back to     What’s neat is that we can see this discharging (step III) occurring in measurements going back several months.  The animation below is showing the average of oceanic temperatures from the depth to the surface.    Temperature anomalies (departures from normal) averaged from the surface to 300 meters (or 984 feet) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.  Red shading shows where temperatures are above-average and blue shading shows where the temperatures are below-average.  Animation by climate.gov using pentad (5-day) averaged data from  .   Watch how you can clearly see the disappearance of the above-average ocean temperatures near the equator of the eastern Pacific Ocean (red shading), with the area of elevated temperatures elongating just to the north and south of equator.  Eventually, the below-average ocean temperatures (blue shading) dominate along the equator.  Another way to track recharge-discharge is in CPC’s  , which has a diagram showing this idea in action (the slide is titled “Warm Water Volume and Niño3.4 Anomalies”).  Discharge is not always this obvious, but given the tremendous El Niño we just had, it is clearly a big player and now all eyes are on whether it cools down enough that a La Niña gets underway. If you’re a regular reader of this blog, you already know  !  (1) In the case of our   (ONI), there was one really oddball El Niño episode that maximized during the late summer/early fall in 1987.  This El Niño is also unusual because it spanned two consecutive winters (1986-87 and 1987-88). (2) Unlike El Niño, La Niña events in particular have been known to last 1-3 years, so while it might weaken sometimes in the spring, it may not fade away entirely.  (3) People read the ENSO blog.  Some folks ask how this happened and I’m a little baffled by it myself.  This is an unabashedly nerdy blog.  But it’s clear to me that this blogging team is top notch, our guest bloggers have been generous about sharing their expertise, and Rebecca is a major reason why it’s not written entirely in Klingon.    (4) We’ve already touched on the “delayed oscillator” mechanism on this blog.  See two such articles by Tony   and  .  The recharge-discharge and delayed oscillator mechanisms are not mutually exclusive in the real world, so they can both be occurring at the same time.  In fact, you can – with math – show that delayed oscillator is a sub-case of recharge-discharge.  The biggest difference is that recharge-discharge theory does not explicitly invoke oceanic waves (  and Rossby waves), while delayed oscillator does.  Recharge-discharge is more focused on the movement of heat from the equator to off the equator and vice versa, while delayed oscillator is focused more on the zonal (east-west) movement of heat.  While we’re not getting into them here, there are a lot of other ENSO mechanisms in the literature as well, but recharge-discharge and delayed oscillator are probably two of the most popular ones.  (5) For those who want more technical details please here are some potentially useful references: Wyrkti, 1985: Water displacements in the Pacific and the genesis of El Niño cycles, . 90, 7129-32.

Observations of warm water volume changes in the equatorial Pacific and their relationship to El Niño and La Niña.  ,  , 3551-3559. (6) Again, the birth of ENSO events is more of a mystery than its death, which tends to be more foreseeable. Why does heat build up over time?  We don’t understand all the details other than this usually occurs after an extended period of ENSO-neutral (normal or average conditions) or La Nina when the trade winds are either near normal or stronger, respectively.  The trade winds blow from east-to-west across the tropical Pacific Ocean.  What happens in that journey is that the water heats up (from the sun) and then piles up in the western Pacific because it has nowhere else to go.  (7) Timing is important too as the average state of the Pacific is more conducive to atmosphere-ocean coupling and growth during the Northern Hemisphere summer and fall.  (8) Not all heat that was on the equator is released to the ocean off the equator.  Some heat goes into the atmosphere resulting in an increase in global air temperatures.   Also, some heat may remain on the equator due to nonlinear processes that don’t cancel out during the El Niño-La Niña cycle – this is referred to as “ENSO rectification on the mean state due to residual nonlinear dynamical heating.”  We won’t get into this now ( ), but maybe we’ll get someone to guest post on it sometime.  (9) Not only is the heat draining off the equator during the peak of El Niño (usually Northern Hemisphere winter), but as the event progresses into the spring, the average state of the Pacific Ocean becomes less conducive to coupling (less of a normally present east-west SST gradient and weaker Bjerknes feedback, which is something we briefly referred to in this  ).   Submitted by   on Fri, 06/24/2016 - 16:50 Hi Dave, thanks for compliments on the post. As for your question about our offices, it depends on where you are.

How to turn an animation of a year's worth of daily rain maps into a single picture.", "content": "  The seasonal migration of rainfall in Africa is one of the major rhythms of Earth’s climate system. Rains are generally dominated by the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), where the trade winds in each hemisphere meet. Millions of people rely on the timely seasonal progression of the rains in order to plant crops and feed their families. As seen in the animation above, the seasonal migration of the rains across the continent lead to distinct rainfall seasons in West Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa. An animation shows this pattern easily. But imagine you were trying to explain this pattern to someone and you were only allowed to use a small amount of space on a single printed page. That’s a conundrum scientists face all the time when they are explaining their research. You’d be left with static images to describe an anything but static earth. Because try as we might, we have yet to create artistic technology that mimics the moving pictures found in newspapers and artwork throughout the Harry Potter universe. But have no fear! It’s a tough problem, but someone’s already solved it. In 1949, a scientist by the name of Ernest Hovmöller created a diagram that excels at showing movement in static pictures (Hovmöller 1949). A cross between a map and a graph, the figure is known today as a  . Each individual column in this Hovmoller Diagram is one day of rainfall across Africa (20W-55E), averaged by latitude. The columns are arranged chronologically like the books on a shelf. The horizontal axis shows the time of year, and the vertical axis shows how much it rained at each latitude. Animation by Mary Lindsey and Hunter Allen, based on data provided by the Climate Prediction Center.   Hovmöller Diagrams average all the values in a single column of longitude or row of latitude and puts those values on one axis. The other axis represents time. In the example above, we are using the horizontal dimension (X axis) to represent   and the vertical dimension (Y-axis) to represent  . This way, we can show how rain moves north or south over the course of the year. Still a bit confused?  The animation below shows how we built our Hovmöller Diagram. In the Hovmöller Diagram, you can still see that the heaviest rains push farthest up (north) along the Y-axis in the northern hemisphere summer (June-August). In contrast, during the southern hemisphere summer (December-February), the opposite occurs. Rains are farther down (south) along the Y-axis. The seasonal cycle of African rainfall is simplified in one tidy figure! While they may pale in comparison to the type of sorcery seen in Harry Potter, Hovmöller Diagrams are excellent at tracking signals that move, like rains in Africa. These diagrams can be used for many more types of atmospheric features. Stay tuned for our next post where we rotate a Hovmöller Diagram by 90° and learn how to use it to learn more about a recent   across the Maritime Continent. Hovmöller, E.

ENSO arises from changes across the tropical Pacific Ocean. So why does ENSO affect the climate over sizable portions of the globe, including some regions far removed from the tropical Pacific Ocean?  Does the strength of ENSO matter for global impacts?  ENSO affects the sea surface temperature (SST) in regions where fishing is a major industry to some countries. A prominent example is the anchovy fishing routinely done off the northwest coast of Peru. When El Niño occurs, the warmed waters become unfavorable for the fish, which flee for cooler waters, resulting in poor harvests that are detrimental to the Peruvian economy. But the abnormal tropical Pacfic SSTs are only the beginning of the story of ENSO’s impacts. When El Niño occurs, the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean becomes warmer than average. With the elevated SST, there is more thunderstorm activity, or convection, than usual over the waters in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. This convection is caused by the increased temperature and moisture in the air right above the warmed water. This warm, moist air rises to form thunderstorm clouds. The process causes  in the upper atmosphere: heat from the warmed surface of the ocean is released when water vapor condenses into clouds and rainfall. With more storminess than usual, the upper atmosphere becomes warmer than usual, and this extra heat sets in motion yet another series of important effects. The rising air in the tropical Pacific can branch away from the equator toward the higher latitudes, both northward and southward, contributing to the complex circulation patterns that help establish the average worldwide climate features. This poleward movement of air in the upper atmosphere, sinking motion over the subtropics, and the return flow at lower levels of the atmosphere toward the lower pressure at the equator, is called the   (see figure). El Niño influences global atmospheric circulation by intensifying the Hadley circulation, in which heat is transferred from the Earth's surface to the upper atmosphere through convection and latent heating. Map by NOAA Climate.gov. When an El Niño causes excess heating in the tropical Pacific upper atmosphere, the air flow toward the poles becomes more vigorous. The change in the strength of the Hadley circulation leads to modifications in the circulation patterns worldwide, including, for example, the position of the jet stream that flows from west to east over the North Pacific in winter months. El Niño tends to lead to an elongated jet stream that can extend all the way to North America and bring an above-average supply of storms across the southern part of the United States. By strengthening the Hadley circulation, El Niño can trigger a cascade of noticeable departures from the normal rainfall patterns around the globe. The changes in the atmospheric circulation, and subsequent ground-level climate impacts, that stretch across the globe are called El Niño   (see figure). Teleconnection patterns emerge in climate simulations, and they show up in historical observations. Typical rainfall patterns during El Niño events. Such teleconnections are   during El Niño events, but not  . Map by  . Observations since 1950 indicate that impacts during El Niño depend on the season. The figure shows what changes, and during which seasons, El Niño is expected to bring about across the globe. It must be emphasized that while these impacts are   during El Niño, they are not   to occur. The stronger the El Niño, however, the more likely the teleconnection side effects become. There is also some correlation between the strength of the El Niño and the severity of the effects (Lyon and Barnston, 2005), but, again, it must be stressed that there are no guarantees here either. The most reliable effects of El Niño are deficient rainfall over Indonesia and northern South America, and excess rainfall in southeastern South America, eastern equatorial Africa, and the southern US.

As the 2020–21 La Niña has  , leaving us with neutral conditions in the tropical Pacific, we now wonder if we have seen the last of La Niña for a while or if we will see another dip into La Niña conditions by next fall. In the world of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), double-dipping is not a party foul—it’s actually quite common for La Niña to occur in consecutive winters (not El Niño, though). If you’re wondering why, then this is the blog post for you! To understand why La Niña commonly double dips, we first need some basic understanding of ENSO  . Often, we think of El Niño and La Niña as mirror opposites—for example, that the warmer-than-average east-central tropical Pacific conditions during El Niño are exactly matched by the cooler-than-average conditions of La Niña. This mirror-opposites perspective is a pretty good approximation, but it’s not perfect!   Average November – January sea surface temperature anomalies (°C) for the top 10 strongest (top) El Niño and (bottom) La Niña events since 1950 based on the November – January Niño3.4 index. Anomalies are calculated with respect to 30-year base periods updated every 5 years (see   for a description). NOAA Climate.gov figure with   obtained from the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory. Upon closer inspection, we see some subtle but important differences between El Niño and La Niña in terms of their patterns and behavior. First, the sea surface temperature anomalies (difference from the long-term average) during El Niño tend to be centered farther east than for La Niña, especially for   episodes. Second, the strongest El Niños tend to be stronger than the strongest La Niñas. We can see these differences in the maps above. The warm anomalies in the eastern Pacific for the El Niño composite are between 2.25 and 2.75 degrees Celsius (4 and 5 degrees Fahrenheit), while the cool anomalies in the east-central Pacific for the La Niña composite top out at 2.25 degrees C.  Monthly sea surface temperature anomalies in the Niño 3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for (top) all first-year El Niño and (bottom) first-year La Niña winters since 1950, starting in the March before the first-year peak. Climate.gov graph based on ERSSTv5 temperature data. We also see notable differences in how   in the Niño 3.4 region of the Pacific change over time for first-year El Niños (meaning, the previous winter did not feature El Niño) and first-year La Niñas. After the peak of El Niño, which typically occurs in late fall or winter, Niño3.4 surface temperatures usually decline rapidly to neutral conditions by the following spring. In the ensuing summer through winter, ENSO neutral conditions continue, or La Nina develops, but the occurrence of El Niño in a second consecutive winter is uncommon.  For La Niña, in contrast, the return to ENSO neutral after the late fall peak is usually more gradual, and, as Emily  , the transition to El Niño after the first winter of La Niña rarely occurs. Instead, we generally see ENSO-neutral or a transition back into La Niña conditions by the following fall, as shown by that second dip in average Niño3.4 temperatures in the plot above. To reiterate what Emily already noted, of the 12 first-year La Niña events  , 8 were followed by La Niña the next winter, 2 by neutral, and 2 by El Niño. Things would be simpler if El Niño and La Niña behaved similarly, so why are the transitions out of El Niño and La Niña so different? The answers lie in the processes that cause El Niño and La Niña to strengthen and weaken. Several months ago, Michelle introduced us to the essential processes for ENSO, the fun-to-say  . Essentially, Bjerknes feedbacks describe the reinforcing interactions (positive feedbacks) between the ocean and atmosphere that cause El Niño and La Niña to grow: changes in the tropical Pacific ocean temperatures cause changes in the overlying trade winds, which then cause additional, reinforcing changes in the ocean temperature (please see   for more of the details!).     May–September monthly zonal (east-west direction) wind stress anomalies against the monthly sea surface temperature anomalies in the   3.4 region from 1980-2016. The wind stress anomalies corresponding to La Niña conditions (blue dots) are averaged over the central tropical Pacific from 5°S - 5°N and 167°E - 153°W. The wind stress anomalies corresponding to El Niño conditions (red dots) are averaged farther east, 5°S - 5°N and 179° - 139°W. These regions have the strongest relationship with the Niño 3.4 index and are chosen following  . The steeper slope of the linear fit to the red dots relative to the linear fit to the blue dots indicates a stronger zonal wind stress response under El Niño conditions. NOAA Climate.gov figure based on   wind stress data and ERRSSTv5 sea surface temperature data.  If all essential processes that comprise this feedback process were equal but opposite for El Niño and La Niña, then we might expect mirror opposite patterns. However, this isn’t the case. For example, the response of the trade winds to the Niño3.4 surface temperatures is unequal between warmer and cooler surface conditions. We see this above in the scatter plot of monthly May–September zonal (east-west direction) wind stress anomalies (1) in the equatorial Pacific versus the Niño3.4 surface temperature anomalies. As we expect, warmer Niño3.4 surface temperatures that are tied to El Niño conditions bring weaker trade winds and a weaker   (positive wind stress anomalies), whereas cooler Niño3.4 conditions bring stronger trade winds (negative wind stress anomalies) connected with a stronger Walker circulation. However, the plot also reveals that the relationship between the warm (El Niño) and cool (La Niña) sea surface temperature anomalies and the wind anomalies they generate is not equal. El Niño’s warm water anomalies generally produce wind stress anomalies that are stronger and farther east than those produced by cool La Niña anomalies of equal strength. The stronger response is demonstrated by the steeper slope of the red line versus the blue line. This difference may seem a bit subtle, but it can have big consequences for ENSO asymmetry (2). The strength of the coupling between the winds and upper ocean matters because it not only strengthens El Niño and La Niña, but it also sets the wheels in motion for the ultimate demise of each event. The strong coupling between ocean and atmosphere and the more eastward wind stress anomalies during El Niño contributes to a robust  , typically by early spring, that ends the El Niño event and sets the stage for the next La Niña. The weaker coupling and more westward wind stress anomalies during La Niña means that the corresponding “recharge” of heat is also weaker, and so the ocean is not as primed for a transition to El Niño. Instead, if we experience the right sequence of tropical weather, a second winter of La Niña may return instead (3). The scenario I have described is far from complete, as there are many other atmospheric and oceanic (and even  !) processes that likely contribute to ENSO asymmetry and the tendency for La Niña to persist for more than one winter (4). There is still considerable debate about which processes are most important for these El Niño/La Niña differences (still so much unsettled ENSO science!). Can we predict when La Niña will double-dip? Some recent studies suggest that we may be able to predict (in a  ) more than a year in advance the likelihood of two-year La Niña based on the strength of the preceding El Niño and poleward discharge of equatorial heat (5). However, the most recent La Niña is a bit unusual because El Niño did not immediately precede it, and so it is difficult to identify any clear indicators that La Niña will return next fall at this time. Although we must await further guidance to get a better handle on the forecast, we at least can say that both history and the   suggest that El Niño is unlikely to return in the near future. (1)   Wind stress measures the lateral force per unit area that the wind exerts on the ocean surface. A “positive zonal wind stress anomaly” corresponds to an anomalous eastward force on the ocean surface, exerted by a stronger-than-average eastward component of the winds; this   the normally westward force exerted by the trade winds. Conversely, negative zonal wind stress anomalies indicate a   westward force on the surface ocean, exerted by stronger-than-average westward trade winds.  (2)   The zonal wind stress analysis of this post is modeled after  . That study provides conceptual and theoretical support for the hypothesis that the asymmetry in zonal wind stress response to tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, like what is shown in the scatter plot of this post, is sufficient for explaining many of the asymmetries between El Niño and La Niña, including the tendency for La Niña to persist for more than one winter (see the next footnote for additional details).

Wittenberg, 2013:  ENSO transition, duration, and amplitude asymmetries: Role of the nonlinear wind stress coupling in a conceptual model.  ,  , 9462-9476.   (3)   For those of you who are interested in more of the scientific details about how this wind stress asymmetry between El Niño and La Niña may contribute to the tendency for La Niña to double-dip, this footnote provides additional, more technical discussion, courtesy of  . ENSO events are sparked by a   between two coupled ocean/atmosphere time scales in the response to wind changes: a fast equatorial adjustment (oceanic equatorial   +  ), and a slow off-equatorial adjustment (curl-induced oceanic Rossby waves and delayed negative feedbacks). Equatorial wind anomalies that are located farther east (as during a strong El Niño) induce more transient growth, disequilibrium, and overshoot into the opposite phase, for 2 key reasons.  (1) Their resulting zonal current anomalies & upwelling anomalies are located closer to the warm pool edge in the central Pacific and shallow   of the east Pacific.  This strengthens the transient growth via fast equatorial processes (zonal advective feedback and Ekman feedback, two of the important Bjerknes feedbacks), which amps the wind anomalies so much that they can over-discharge the equatorial thermocline several months later.  (2) When the off-equatorial wind stress curl anomalies are located farther east, they’re also farther from the western boundary, and so their resulting off-equatorial oceanic Rossby wave trains have farther/longer to travel before they can reflect back onto the equator and start the turnabout of the ENSO event.  This enables the equatorial disequilibrium to grow more strongly before being impeded & eventually reversed by the delayed negative feedback.  Thus, the more eastward-shifted zonal wind stress anomalies during strong El Niños enable stronger transient growth & disequilibrium, increasing the over-discharging and subsequent overshoot. In short, under the “zonal wind stress asymmetry hypothesis” of  , La Niña is more likely to double-dip because its winds stress anomaly is so   from the “sea surface temperature-ticklish” zone of the central/eastern Pacific, and so   to the western boundary “transfer station” for the off-equatorial feedbacks, that La Niña just can’t get as much of a disequilibrium going – and hence can’t over-charge the equator enough to guarantee an overshoot into El Niño.

I really appreciate and learn tons of new things! you're amazing! Submitted by   on Mon, 10/11/2021 - 15:31 Here along the west coast, the La Nina'ish teleconnections (not necessarily SSTA's at that point) suggests an atmospheric origin in 2019-20 prior to the oceanic La Nina 2020-21. Since the same anomalous Wx pattern is persisting through 2020-21 (resulting in 2 yrs of record heat and drought), \nis it possible that 2021 was really the 2nd year of La Nina (weather-wise) and we may now hope for a slow return to more normal conditions in 2021-22? Submitted by   on Mon, 10/11/2021 - 15:31 Hi Craig, La Nina isn't the only game in town when it comes to influencing West Coast weather. Sometimes other climate phenomena or just the randomness of our atmosphere can lead to similar weather patterns to La Nina but have nothing to do with the tropical Pacific. In 2019-2020, there was no active La Nina in the Pacific, but that doesn't mean that drought couldn't happen in the West Coast. It's just bad luck that there was a dry year preceding the La Nina which often also leads to drier outcomes for parts of the West Coast.

Submitted by   on Sun, 11/14/2021 - 14:02 In reply to   by  Hi, what are the chances of El Niño and the rain returning again for 22-23?  Submitted by   on Sat, 02/19/2022 - 18:19 As I look at through the decades of past episodes of seemingly 4, and not just 3, long-term la Nina episodes of more than 2 years, (especially to include the winter months), I see that they rather robustly occur every 22 years. The correlation is found in every other (odd numbered) solar cycle as upticks flip every 11 year cycle from a northern polarity to a southern polarity and then back again. Meanwhile, every new solar cycle upstart seem to favor a la Nina, which have been declining in episode strength lately. The mid cycle peak of sun spot activity with a lag of hot solar wind favor warmer conditions as they should. The sun is 99.8 of the mass of our solar system and maybe doing more driving than we have known, or at least illuded too. Just like hurricane season lags into the late fall past peak heating, there is likewise a bit of a lag-effect following an uptick in new sun spot activity. The magnetic fields flipping back to \"normal\" every other 22 year clearly have this triple-dip tendency. (give or take a couple of \"neutral\" months seen during 1974 and 2021 triple-dip runs), maybe there is a 44 year bump in this road too, or just the fact that we are headed into another grand solar minimum.  Either way, the declining sun spot activity over the last 40 years may also be influencing the weaker tendency of the strength of both warm and cold climate cycles. That's my two Indian cents. #happynativeamericanheritagemonth  Submitted by   on Thu, 11/10/2022 - 17:31 In reply to   by  Keep your eyes on our monthly updates posted here (2nd Thursday of each month):  Our official probabilities (which are linked at the end of the second paragraph) are here: Right now (and this will update monthly) we are around 35% for the summer and fall.   Submitted by   on Tue, 02/22/2022 - 12:04"}
