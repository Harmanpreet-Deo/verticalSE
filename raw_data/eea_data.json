Mitigating climate change means   into the atmosphere. This involves cutting greenhouse gases from main sources such as power plants, factories, cars, and farms. Forests, oceans, and soil also absorb and store these gases, and are an important part of the solution. Reducing and avoiding our emissions requires us to reshape everything we do — from how we power our economy and grow our food, to how we travel and live, and the products we consume. It is a problem felt  .  In the past decades, the   against climate change, resulting in a more than 37% drop in EU emissions in 2023 compared with 1990 levels. This is mainly a result of a growing use of  and decreased use of carbon-intensive fossil fuels. Improvements in   and structural changes in the economy also contributed to meeting these goals. Now, more ambitious goals are set that include a net  below 1990 levels by 2030 and a climate-neutrality objective by 2050. Reaching these goals will require even higher emission cuts through transitioning from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. It also means   and   until we reach the point where the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is balanced with the capture and storage of these gases in our forests, oceans and soil.

Most EU sectors reduced greenhouse gas emissions over the past three decades, with the highest reductions in the energy supply sector. Still, agriculture and transport struggle to reduce emissions: The EU also achieved its target for  . By 2023,  .  The EU has managed to continue reducing its energy consumption: primary energy use has fallen by 19% since 2005, while final energy consumption saw a 11% reduction during the same timeframe, according to early estimates for 2023.  The European Green Deal sets the overall roadmap for achieving EU climate neutrality by 2050 by tackling the threat of climate change while also growing economically and protecting people’s well-being. With the European Climate Law, the EU made   goal, set an interim target of a net 55% emission reduction by 2030 and is working on setting the 2040 target. The   aims to bring EU legislation in line with the 2030 goal. The impacts of the 2022 gas and energy security crisis highlighted the importance of transitioning faster towards a clean and secure EU energy system.  Under the wider umbrella of the European Green Deal, Europe's 2030 policy ambitions include: To accelerate this transition, Europe must ensure that investments and finance support sustainability. Energy and mobility sectors especially must distance themselves from unsustainable technologies.  6% of global emissions are released by the EU 37% reduction in EU emissions achieved in 2023 compared to 1990 levels 55% is the EU reduction target by 2030  compared to 1990 levels Total net greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union  , marking significant progress towards climate neutrality for the EU. The huge drop was led by a significant decline in coal use and growth of renewable energy sources and supported by reduced energy consumption across Europe, according to estimated figures included in the latest European Environment Agency (EEA) ‘Trends and Projections’ report. The annual EEA check-up on EU progress on its energy and climate targets stresses that EU Member States will need to sustain this rate of progress to achieve Europe’s climate and energy targets.

The largest reductions in emissions occurred in  , which includes energy industries and fugitive (leaked or uncaptured) emissions (-65%), waste (-37%) and agriculture (-21%). A robust reporting system is required to  . The EEA is a key player in setting up these  , providing guidance to Member States on how to report and quality check the input.

In simple terms, photosynthesis is the process through which trees and plants capture carbon from the atmosphere and release oxygen. This natural process happens to be one of our best allies and the most efficient technology to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. With the  , we get detailed information on what grows on the ground. Knowing where vegetated areas are and what type of vegetation is growing there is crucial for calculating net greenhouse gas emissions.

Ozone layer depletion could have serious effects on human health and the environment.  occurs over both hemispheres of the Earth. However, this phenomenon is more pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere (Antarctica) than in the Northern Hemisphere (Arctic). This is the case because the formation of the ozone hole is directly linked to the stratosphere's temperature. Once temperatures drop below -78°C, polar stratospheric clouds tend to form, which exacerbate ozone depletion. In the Antarctic, long presence of low   is stimulating their formation, whereas the Arctic is characterised by larger year-to-year meteorological variability. \r Dobson Units (DU) measure how much ozone is in the air above us. On a global scale, the average total ozone concentration is typically around 300 DU. Ozone levels tend to be higher near the poles and lower at the equator. Generally, the ozone hole is defined as the area for which ozone column values amount to 220 Dobson Units (DU, marked by the thick contour line in Figure 1) or less (represented in blue colours in Figure 1). This is only apparent in the southern hemisphere. Here, the largest historical extent of the ozone hole — 28.4 million square kilometres (Figure 1) — occurred in September 2000. This area is equivalent to almost seven times the territory of the EU. Please select a resource that has a preview image available. This year's ozone hole over the Southern Hemisphere had a maximum area of 21.9 million km² at the end of September (Figure 2), making it the smallest ozone hole since 2020. Data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) already indicated an unusually large and persistent ozone hole over the Antarctic in the period from 2020 to 2022 for which the drivers are currently still subject to research. While UNEP's scientific assessment report projects that global stratospheric ozone will return to 1980 levels around 2040, the behaviour of the southern ozone layer contrasts with observations in the past 40 years. Nonetheless, CAMS researchers expect to see a full recovery of the ozone hole by mid-century. \r Please select a resource that has a preview image available. When it comes to the identification of drivers of ozone depletion, the complex interaction of chemical and meteorological factors makes it difficult to attribute ozone hole evolution to a single individual component. One aspect is the strength of the polar vortex. For instance, the strength of the polar vortex in 2021 exceeded all other years which resulted in a large ozone hole. In late 2023, the ozone hole was unusually persistent during November, remaining over 14.2m2, roughly the area of Antarctica, until early December, closing on 20 December 2023 being the third longest-lived ozone hole, after the years 1999 and 2020 closing 27 December. In 2024, a highly disrupted southern polar vortex during austral winter contributed to late depletion of ozone starting in late August. Under normal meteorological conditions the hole begins to form in mid to late August and closes towards the end of November. Overall, the evolution of the 2024 ozone hole appears to be like the one in 2022.\r \r Another facet which acts as a driver to the ozone hole’s size is stratospheric temperature, with warmer temperatures leading to a smaller ozone hole, such as in 2019 and 2024 (CAMS, 2024 - see the list of scientific references). Two episodes of sudden stratospheric warming in July 2024 added to the above-mentioned phenomenon. When the polar vortex is weak, with higher temperatures and slower winds than usual in the stratosphere, ozone depletion process is weaker, leading to ozone columns above 220 Dobson units (DU). Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) cannot directly be attributed to a larger ozone hole, as they exert a dual effect. While GHGs are thought to lead to warmer temperatures, they tend to have a cooling effect in the middle and upper stratosphere which reduces the temperature exchange between the different layers of Earth's atmosphere. This stratospheric cooling effect is generally positively associated with ozone recovery, except for the polar regions. Here, very low temperatures can lead to an increase in the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, which facilitate ozone depletion as explained above. The ozone hole can also be periodically influenced by volcanic eruptions and forest wildfires, perturbing chemical and dynamic processes which in return affect stratospheric ozone amounts.   the eruption of the Hunga Tonga - Hunga Ha’apai volcano in early 2022, that injected huge amounts of water vapour into the stratosphere, might also have influenced the extent and intensity of ozone depletion in 2023. Finally, smoke-charged vortex (SCV) resulting from wildfires transport aerosols into the stratosphere, and this leads to both depleting and increasing the ozone layer stemming from different chemical reactions at different atmospheric layers, depletion being the bigger part (Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, 2024 - see the list of scientific references). With the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires driven by global warming, the formation of SCVs and their impact on the stratosphere could become more common, posing a threat to the ozone layer. The new findings by researchers of the Max Planck Institute highlight that natural events, exacerbated by climate change, pose additional risks to this fragile stratospheric layer. Since current observations show that the size and persistence of the ozone hole are largely dynamically driven, the urgence of continuing global efforts under the Montreal Protocol to ensure a swift recovery of the ozone layer and mitigating climate change remain key.

The urban landscape of Europe is heterogenous and characterised by a diversity of mostly small and medium cities.  Despite this diversity, it is clear that cities will need to play a key role in achieving sustainability in Europe.  With the support of urban stakeholders, the EEA developed a conceptual model and selected   to assess the role of cities in urban transitions towards environmental sustainability, within the broad European Green Deal framework and the EU Urban Agenda.    Cities have an outsized environmental impact, both positive and negative. On the one hand, urban sprawl encroaches on natural habitats and generates large amounts of pollution. On the other hand, resource use is typically more efficient and large-scale infrastructure projects can result in a lower environmental impact per person. As such, the importance of effective urban planning is hard to overstate. Every decision about how we use the land in urban spaces can either improve peoples’ lives and reduce our impact on the environment or have precisely the opposite effect. The   suite of products gives users access to detailed land cover/land use maps for 788 Functional Urban Areas across Europe, as well as additional street tree maps, building block height measurements, and population estimates. These products provide information necessary for urban planners to make informed, data-driven decisions about things like green spaces, transportation networks, and emergency response plans.

The ‘ ’ report highlights the need to take a broader view on such priorities as  . It recognises that Europe’s socio-economic systems and wellbeing of its citizens depend crucially on a healthy and resilient natural environment, a stable climate and long-term sustainable use of resources.   Global pandemic, war, inflation and other shocks and crises have tested the European Green Deal and its ambition of building a climate-neutral and sustainable economy. Two new EEA reports discuss how Europe can respond to the pressing and complex societal challenges while moving towards long-term sustainability goals.

Considering these new challenges, it is even more urgent to rethink agriculture and food systems to make them resilient and sustainable. We should also be asking broader questions.

Man-made ozone-depleting substances destroy the protective ozone layer and, in 1987, the international community established the Montreal Protocol to cut their consumption and production. To fulfil its obligations under the Montreal Protocol, the EU has adopted the more ambitious EU Ozone Regulation. This online data viewer contains information on ozone-depleting substances in the EU, based on aggregated data reported by companies since 2006 under the Ozone Regulation.  In 1989, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer entered into force. Its objective is to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production of  . The protocol covers around 100 individual substances with a high  , including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride (CTC), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), bromochloromethane (BCM) and methyl bromide (MB), all of which are referred to as ‘controlled substances’. Within the European Union (EU), the use of and trade in substances is regulated by Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (known as the  ). This regulation stipulates that all companies producing controlled substances or importing them into and/or exporting them out of the EU, as well as feedstock users, process agent users and destruction facilities, must report their activities concerning controlled substances annually. The Ozone Regulation also encompasses five additional ODS that are not covered by the Montreal Protocol. These ‘new substances’ are halon 1202, methyl chloride (MC), ethyl bromide (EB), trifluoroiodomethane (TFIM) and n-propyl bromide (n-PB). Producers, importers and exporters also have to report their activities for these new substances and will cover three additional ozone-depleting substances. The European Environment Agency (EEA) is responsible for collecting, archiving, checking and aggregating information contained in these company reports. The EEA also supports the companies in fulfilling their reporting obligations. The data reported on production, imports and exports are presented to parties to the Montreal Protocol in order to monitor progress in phasing out ODS in compliance with the Protocol. In 2024, 191 companies reported on their 2023 activities under the Ozone Regulation. The EU has already achieved its phase-out goals under the Montreal Protocol and reports on the uses that are still allowed. This online data viewer summarizes the most recent data reported by companies under the Ozone Regulation and looks at trends since 2006. Data from 2012 onwards were also updated, based on reports resubmitted after the reporting deadlines for these years.  Since the potential to harm the ozone layer varies among substances, results are expressed in both metric tonnes and ODP tonnes (see definition of ODP or ozone depleting potential in the terminology below). The observed trends can differ significantly depending on the unit used. Controlled substances with a relatively high ODP (e.g. CFCs and CTC) exhibit a different trend from those with a relatively low ODP (e.g. HCFCs). Consumption is an aggregated parameter calculated for data reported under the Montreal Protocol (see Box 1 below). It integrates the statistics on imports, exports, production and destruction of controlled substances into one single metric, excluding non-virgin imports and exports. Amounts that are produced and imported for feedstock use within the EU and process agent use are not included in consumption figures, in line with calculations applied under the Montreal Protocol. New substances listed in Annex II to the Ozone Regulation are also excluded from consumption data. In brief, consumption (which only applies to controlled substances) is calculated as follows: with In 2023, the consumption of controlled substances was positive, amounting to 1,306 metric tonnes, up from -2,954 metric tonnes in 2022. The positive consumption level is the result of significant stocks of quantities for ‘Feedstock outside the EU’ which are not reflected in total exports. The single activities that contribute to ODS consumption are shown in the figure below. If the sum of production and imports exceeds the sum of exports and destruction, the consumption is positive, and vice versa. In recent years, the consumption of controlled substances has largely been driven by CTC, HCFCs and CFC consumption. Expressed in ODP tonnes, consumption in 2023 amounted to 1,778 ODP tonnes, up from -3,165 ODP tonnes in 2022. In 2023, imports of controlled virgin substances into the EU amounted to 3,593 metric tonnes, which represents a 2% decrease compared to 2022. The imported controlled substances were almost entirely virgin substances and 80% of them were imported from China. Around 79% of the imported virgin quantities were HCFCs, followed by BCM and halons. Controlled virgin substances were almost exclusively imported for feedstock use. Imports of controlled non-virgin substances amounted to about 2% of total imports. Expressed in ODP tonnes, imports of virgin halons and HCFCs were largest.  When expressed in ODP tonnes, imports are showing an increasing trend, up from 1,934 ODP tonnes in 2021 to 3,061 ODP tonnes in 2023. This is mainly due to increased import of Halons for feedstock use, which exhibit significant ODP. In 2023, exports of controlled virgin substances from the EU amounted to 27,274 metric tonnes. Overall, exports decreased by 31% compared to 2022. CTC accounted for the largest quantities of exported virgin substances (89% of total exports when expressed in metric tonnes), followed by HCFCs (11% of total exports). Both CTC and HCFCs were mainly exported for feedstock use outside the EU. ODS quantities were mainly exported to the United States (89%) and Great Britain (7%). Since almost no CTC was imported in 2023, the exported quantities were mainly produced in the EU or taken from stocks which had accumulated from previous years. Looking at ODP tonnes, exports decreased by 7%. In terms of proportions, exports of virgin CTC were also largest (99% of total exports when expressed in ODP tonnes). Similar to imports, controlled non-virgin substances were exported out of the EU to a much lesser extent than controlled virgin substances. In 2023, non-virgin substances compose less than 1% of total exports when expressed in metric tonnes. In 2023, the production of controlled substances in the EU amounted to 157,006 metric tonnes, a 20% decrease compared with 2022. Thereof, 32,599 metric tonnes are relevant for consumption. The quantities produced included mostly production of HCFCs, CTC and TCA. Only minor quantities of BCM, halons, CFCs and HBFCs, and no MB, were produced. In terms of metric tonnes, production for feedstock use inside the EU decreased by 20%, and production for process agent use showed a decrease in 2023 compared with 2022 as well. Production for other uses in metric tonnes, as accounted for in the estimation of the consumption of controlled substances (see Box 1 above and the section on consumption), decreased by 21% in 2023 compared with 2022. Expressed in ODP tonnes, production of CTC and HCFCs was largest (81% and 9% of total production, respectively). Controlled substances were mainly produced for feedstock use inside the EU (79% of the produced quantity in metric tonnes). In 2023, 4,020 metric tonnes of controlled substances were destroyed in total, an 16% decrease compared with 2022. The largest quantities destroyed were of CTC, CFCs and HCFCs (82%, 9% and 7% of total destruction, respectively). Expressed in ODP, destruction amounted to 4,064 ODP tonnes and decreased by 20% compared to the year before. The largest quantities destroyed were of CTC, CFCs and halons (90%, 9% and 1% of total destruction, respectively). A number of ODS serve as feedstock for the manufacture of other products such as refrigerants, foam blowing agents, polymers, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. In 2023, feedstock use amounted to 130,112 metric tonnes, a 17% decrease compared with 2022. Feedstock availability was 129,561 metric tonnes in 2023, down by 17% from 2022. Overall, feedstock availability, which is calculated as the sum of the production for feedstock use inside the EU and the imports for feedstock use inside the EU, was therefore at a comparable level to feedstock use, indicating that the EEA reporting systems covers all relevant undertakings from the supply as well from the production side. In 2022, the emission   from feedstock uses was 0.04% of the reported make-up. The 2023 average emission rate was slightly higher than the emission rate in 2022 and also marginally higher than the average emission rate obtained from earlier years (2016 to 2022). A process agent is a substance that either facilitates or inhibits a chemical reaction in an industrial process. In 2023, total   and emissions stayed well below restrictions imposed by both the Montreal Protocol and the Ozone Regulation. The Ozone Regulation is more stringent than the rules of the Montreal Protocol and encompasses new substances (halon 1202, n-PB, EB, TFIM and MC). In 2023, the production of new substances amounted to 614,362 metric tonnes, a 17% decrease compared with 2022. Production of new substances is therefore at its lowest level since 2009. The production of new substances was almost exclusively for feedstock use and related to MC (more than 99% of total production), n-PB and EB. Expressed in ODP tonnes, the production of MC was also largest (99% of total production). In 2023, the production of new substances was about four times higher than the production of controlled substances expressed in metric tonnes. However, when expressed in ODP tonnes, the production of new substances was around one fifth the production of controlled substances in the same year. This is because new substances, on average, have significantly lower ODP than controlled substances. ODS are substances, mainly compounds containing chlorine and/or bromine, that reach the stratosphere of the Earth and whose breakdown products react with the stratospheric ozone. This reduces the concentration levels of ozone in that region of the atmosphere (commonly known as the ozone layer) and thus the capacity of the atmosphere to filter ultraviolet light. Most known ODS are regulated under the Montreal Protocol. Controlled substances are ODS that are listed in Annex I of the Ozone Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009) and are subject to the reporting obligation of Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol. The term ‘mixtures’ refers to gas mixtures consisting of multiple substances, at least one of which is a controlled substance. Destruction facilities are required to report the quantities of individual substances destroyed each year. In certain cases, however, companies were only able to report on the destruction of mixtures of controlled substances with an unknown composition. Therefore, these mixtures are not included in the data presented in this online data viewer and are not reported under the Montreal Protocol. The term ‘new substances’ refers to the five additional substances covered by the EU Ozone Regulation that are not included within the scope of the Montreal Protocol: halon 1202, n-propyl bromide (n-PB), ethyl bromide (EB), trifluoroiodomethane (TFIM) and methyl chloride (MC). Companies in the EU are obliged to report on the import, export and production of these substances in line with the Ozone Regulation’s higher level of ambition than that of the Montreal Protocol. New substances should not be confused with virgin substances (see below). These are substances that have been produced and have not been previously used. Newly produced substances are, by definition, virgin. These are substances that have been previously used and subsequently recovered from products and equipment, and/or been recycled or reclaimed. A number of ODS serve as chemical building blocks for the manufacture of other chemicals (i.e. as ‘feedstock’). They are used (directly or indirectly) for the manufacture of a diverse range of products including refrigerants, foam blowing agents, solvents, polymers, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. A process agent is a substance that either facilitates a chemical reaction or inhibits an intended chemical reaction in an industrial process. Make-up is the quantity of virgin, recovered or reclaimed controlled substances that has not been used in the process cycle before, and that is fed into the process cycle for the first time. For feedstock and process agent uses of controlled substances, make-up has to be reported, including the emissions generated during their use. The ozone-depleting potential (ODP) of a substance refers to the relative amount of ozone depletion caused by it. It is the ratio of the impact on ozone of the emission of a chemical substance to the impact of a similar emission by mass of CFC-11. The quantity in metric tonnes of a particular controlled substance is multiplied by its ODP to give its overall potential to deplete the ozone layer. For instance, 1 metric tonne of CFC-11 corresponds to 1 ODP tonnes (as its ODP is equal to 1), whilst for bromotrifluoromethane or halon 1301 (with an ODP = 10), 1 metric tonne corresponds to 10 ODP tonnes. The ODPs of controlled and new substances are listed in Annexes I and II of the Ozone Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009). Some new substances have a range, rather than a single ODP value. In this online data viewer, the highest value of the ODP value range is used."},

Overall, the outlook for putting these conditions in place by 2030 is positive, but phasing out fossil fuel subsidies without delay seems unlikely as most EU Member States still lack concrete plans to do so, the EEA report notes. Our analysis shows that Member States need to urgently strengthen actions to meet Europe’s environment and climate ambitions by 2030. This includes full implementation of current laws, increased investments in future-proof technologies and making sustainability a central element in all policies. The EEA report concludes that a number of the 8  EAP monitoring targets reflect the high ambitions of the European Green Deal and that Member States may need more time to take measures to achieve them. At the same time, several of the targets require two to nine times faster pace of progress until 2030, compared with progress over the past 10 years. Overall, stronger implementation of existing legislation by the Member States, bringing forward additional policies and measures when necessary, and mainstreaming environment and climate policies into other policy areas are urgently needed, the EEA report states. The 8  EAP monitoring targets and indicators   The EEA will assess progress towards the 8  EAP priority objectives annually and use the results of the 8  EAP monitoring reports in its upcoming flagship report on the state and outlook of the European environment, due for publication in 2025."},

Greenhouse gas emission intensity of power generation in the European Union has returned to the overall decreasing trend of the past decades. This follows a slight increase in use of fossil fuels during 2021 and 2022, linked to post-COVID recovery and the war in Ukraine. Generating one kilowatt hour is estimated to have emitted, on average, 19% less CO  in 2023 than in 2022 and 35% less than a decade ago. Climate and energy policies have effectively lowered carbon-intensive electricity supply over time, resulting in less coal use, more renewables and a more efficient EU generation mix. The EU electricity sector is expected to provide one of the most significant contributions to   by 2030 and be a cornerstone for the Union to reach net climate neutrality by 2050, according to   behind the joint targets. For that to happen, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity of the sector needs to fall drastically through the end of this decade. In 2023, the EU’s electricity sector was estimated to be 58% less GHG intensive than it was in 1990 and 19% less thank 2022. Hydro and nuclear power returned to average generation levels, solar and wind power continued their growth and coal generation resumed its long-term decline. Electricity generation experienced a   (3%, compared with , partly linked to a lower production in specific EU industrial sectors. Until 2010, the need to comply with industrial emissions legislation, such as the   and the shift from fossil fuels to renewable electricity sources drove   of EU electricity supply. As of 2010, the decrease has been almost exclusively due to the transition from fossil fuels to renewable electricity sources, with prices for emission allowances under the   increasing, especially since 2019. To reduce the EU’s net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 (compared with 1990) and reach   by 2050, electricity generation across the EU needs to decarbonise faster. Figure 1 visualises indicative intensity levels that would be consistent with the EU’s climate targets.  Today’s geopolitical context further calls for a   to replace gas, coal and oil use in power supply, heating and transport. This would also contribute to improved energy security and reduced electricity prices in the longer term. Additional policies and measures are needed to deploy renewable generation sources faster, provide incentives to users to save energy and participate actively in the electricity market, and ensure an optimised build out of electricity infrastructures across the European Union.  The   of electricity production differs significantly between Member States. Estonia, Poland, Cyprus and Bulgaria are estimated to have had the highest electricity generation carbon intensity in 2023. This is due to the use of solid fossil fuels, relatively few renewables and limited, or no, nuclear sources in their national electricity mixes.  In eight additional Member States, the carbon intensity was higher than the EU average (Czechia, Greece, Germany, Malta, the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy and Romania). Yet, the GHG intensities for electricity production were lowest in Sweden, Luxembourg and Finland, because of their high share of low-carbon electricity sources (renewables and nuclear power). For  , estimates show the highest rates of decarbonisation in electricity production over the 1990-2023 period in Luxembourg (87% decrease), Denmark (86%), Slovakia (82%) and Latvia (81%). In non-EU EEA countries, all electricity produced in Iceland and most produced in Norway comes from renewable sources, therefore their GHG emission intensities are very low. Türkiye has a relatively high GHG emission intensity of electricity generation. The CO  emission intensity is calculated as the ratio of CO  emissions from electricity generation and gross electricity generation. The GHG intensity of total electricity generation is taken as the ratio of CO equivalent emissions from all electricity production (both from main activity producers and auto-producers) to total electricity generation, including electricity from nuclear plants and renewable sources.  For main activity producers, the CO e emissions from electricity generation only (i.e. excluding emissions resulting from heat production), were estimated as follows: a)      Estimating the transformation input for gross heat production by formula:  . b)     Estimating the transformation input for electricity generation by subtracting the estimated transformation input for gross heat production from total transformation input for electricity and heat generation, by formula ; c)      Multiplying the ratio of b) and the transformation input for electricity and heat generation (ESTAT codes TI_EHG_MAPE_E, TI_EHG_MAPCHP_E, and TI_EHG_MAPH_E) to total CO e emissions from public electricity and heat production (1A1a from the EEA data viewer). Formula:  . The reported CO e emissions in class 1A1a do not include CO e emissions from autoproducers. Emissions from electricity generated by autoproducers were estimated by multiplying the ratio of the energy input for autoproducers and the energy input for main activity producers by the CO e emissions from main activity producers (as calculated in steps a-c above). The energy input for electricity generation by autoproducers was estimated using the same method as for main activity producers (a and b above) using the ESTAT codes GHP_APH and GHP_APCHP for gross heat production and TI_EHG_APE_E, TI_EHG_APCHP_E, and TI_EHG_APH_E for transformation input for electricity and heat production. A zero CO e emission factor was applied to nuclear power and to renewables (including the biodegradable fraction of municipal solid waste), as the method does not take into account life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. This applies also to solid biofuels: in accordance with the United Framework Convention on Climate Change Reporting Guidelines, biofuel-related emissions have to be reported as a memorandum item in greenhouse gas emission inventories, with the assumption being that harvesting emissions would be shown as changes in carbon stocks in the land use, land use change and forestry sector, not in the energy sector. This should not be interpreted, however, as an endorsement of default carbon neutrality or the sustainability of biofuels. The denominator of the GHG intensity of total electricity production is the sum of electricity produced from main activity producers (ESTAT: GEP_MAPE and GEP_MAPCHP) and autoproducers (ESTAT: GEP_APE and GEP_APCHP). Calculation Formula: (CO e * ((ei_MAP – dh_MAP)/ei_MAP))*((ei_AP-dh_AP)/(ei_MAP-dh_MAP))+CO e*((ei_MAP–dh_MAP)/ei_MAP)))/(GEP/85.98), where: The EU aims to be climate-neutral (i.e. its economy will emit net-zero greenhouse gas emissions) by 2050. This objective is at the heart of the European Green Deal and in line with the EU's commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement. Decarbonising electricity supply, for instance by substantially accelerating the deployment of renewable energy sources to achieve a share of almost 70% in electricity generation by 2030 and over 80% by 2050, is critical to achieving this objective.

News   Europe’s environment is at a tipping point. We have a narrow window of opportunity in the next decade to scale up measures to protect nature, lessen the impacts of climate change and radically reduce our consumption of natural resources.   Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director While European environment and climate policies have helped to improve the environment over recent decades, Europe is not making enough progress and the outlook for the environment in the coming decade is not positive, according to the ‘  (SOER 2020)’ report. SOER 2020 is the most comprehensive environmental assessment ever undertaken on Europe. It provides a stark snapshot of where Europe stands in meeting 2020 and 2030 policy targets as well as longer term 2050 goals and ambitions to shift to a sustainable, low carbon future. The report notes that Europe has already made significant progress over the past two decades in terms of climate change mitigation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Signs of progress are also evident in other areas, such as tackling air and water pollution and the introduction of new policies to tackle plastic waste and bolster climate change adaptation and the circular and bio-economy. Furthermore, the EU’s sustainable finance initiative is the first of its kind on the role of the financial sector in driving the necessary shift to a sustainable future. While these achievements are significant, Europe will not achieve its sustainability vision of ‘living well within the limits of the planet’ by continuing to promote economic growth and seeking to manage the environmental and social impacts. The report urges European countries, leaders and policymakers to seize the opportunity and use the next decade to radically scale up and speed up actions to put Europe back on track to meeting its medium and longer-term environmental policy goals and targets to avoid irreversible change and damage. The current range of European policy actions provide an essential foundation for future progress but they are not enough. Europe needs to do things better, it needs to address certain challenges differently, and it needs to rethink its investments. Achieving Europe’s goals will require better implementation and improved coordination between current policies. It will also need additional policy actions to achieve fundamental change in the key systems of production and consumption that underpin our modern lifestyles, such as food, energy and mobility, which have substantial environmental impacts. The report also stresses the importance of how governments can enable a transition to sustainability and the need to address things differently. For example, Europe should rethink how it uses existing innovations and technologies, how production processes could be improved, how research and development into sustainability could be fostered and how changes in consumption patterns and ways of living could be stimulated. Lastly, achieving such change will require investing in a sustainable future and stopping using public funds to subsidise environmentally damaging activities. Europe will gain immensely from such a change in investment priorities because of the economic and social opportunities that it can create. At the same time, it will be crucial to listen to public concerns and ensure widespread support for such a shift — a socially fair transition. The State of the Environment Report is perfectly timed to give us the added impetus we need as we start a new five-year cycle in the European Commission and as we prepare to present the European Green Deal.  In the next five years we will put in place a truly transformative agenda, rolling out new clean technologies, helping citizens to adapt to new job opportunities and changing industries, and shifting to cleaner and more efficient mobility systems and more sustainable food and farming. There will be multiple benefits for Europe and for Europeans if we get this right, and our economy and our planet will be winners too. This is an urgent global challenge, and a unique opportunity for Europe ‘Europe’s environment is at a tipping point. We have a narrow window of opportunity in the next decade to scale up measures to protect nature, lessen the impacts of climate change and radically reduce our consumption of natural resources. Our assessment shows that incremental changes have resulted in progress in some areas but not nearly enough to meet our long-term goals. We already have the knowledge, technologies and tools we need to make key production and consumption systems such as food, mobility and energy sustainable. Our future well-being and prosperity depend on this and our ability to harness society wide action to bring about change and create a better future,’  Overall environmental trends in Europe have not improved since the last EEA state of the environment report in 2015. The assessment notes that while most of the 2020 targets will not be achieved, especially those on biodiversity, there is still a chance to meet the longer-term goals and objectives for 2030 and 2050. Europe has made important gains in resource efficiency and the circular economy. But recent trends highlight a slowing down of progress in areas such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, industrial emissions, waste generation, improving energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy. Looking ahead, the current rate of progress will not be enough to meet 2030 and 2050 climate and energy targets. Protecting and conserving European biodiversity and nature remains the biggest area of discouraging progress. Of the 13 specific policy objectives set for 2020 in this area, only two are likely be met: designating marine protected areas and terrestrial protected areas. Looking ahead to 2030, if current trends continue, they will result in further deterioration of nature and continued pollution of air, water and soil. Climate change, air and noise pollution impacts on the environment and human health are also still of concern. Exposure to fine particulate matter is responsible for around 400 000 premature deaths in Europe every year, affecting central and eastern European countries disproportionally. There is also growing concern over hazardous chemicals and the risks they pose. Looking ahead, the prospects for reducing environmental risks to health would be improved with better integration of environment and health policies. Achieving Europe’s low carbon and sustainability vision is still possible. The report outlines seven key areas where bold action is needed to get Europe back on track to achieve its 2030 and 2050 goals and ambitions. The European environment – state and outlook 2020 is published by the EEA every five years as mandated in its regulation. SOER 2020 is the 6th SOER published by the EEA since 1995. It offers solid, science-based insights on how we must respond to the huge and complex challenges we face, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and air and water pollution. SOER 2020 has been prepared in close collaboration with the EEA’s European Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet). The report draws on the Eionet’s vast expertise of leading experts and scientists in the environmental field, across the EEA’s 33 member countries and six cooperating countries. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Not long after the new coronavirus arrived in Europe, the EEA published Drivers of change of relevance for Europe’s environment and sustainability. The report’s main key message is bold: the desirable normal does not exist. Public participation in environmental decision-making is a legal right in Europe. This principle was established two decades ago by the Aarhus Convention. Since then, it has been increasingly recognised that participation is not only a matter of justice and democracy but also a practical necessity for transitioning into sustainability. This briefing focuses on different forms of public participation from a sustainability transitions perspective, highlights its core tenets, principles and pitfalls. The ways in which societies, institutions and citizens relate to and value nature have played a key role in the interconnected biodiversity, climate change, natural resource and health crises we face. This briefing explores how to reframe the relationships between humans and nature. It examines how holistically understanding humans’ deep interconnection with other life forms and ecosystems could lead to new motivations to protect nature and accelerate the societal transformation we need to live well within the limits of the planet. While global food chains, market competition, industrial processes and increasing productivity have turned agriculture into a profitable economic sector, it is also one of the biggest contributors to environmental and sustainability challenges in Europe and worldwide. This briefing reflects on what makes agriculture unsustainable today — and the types of agriculture we may want to preserve and support. This briefing reflects on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. It asks how these lessons can be applied to our quest for sustainability and how we can govern our societies in a way that respects planetary health as a precondition for human and economic health Innovation is both a primary source of systemic environmental and sustainability challenges and an essential element in society’s response to such challenges. Technological innovation, which is a policy priority across Europe, has historically been a major ‘driver of change’ for society and the ecosphere. Although technological innovations deliver a multitude of benefits, they are also associated with significant collateral hazards and new challenges. Economic growth is closely linked to increases in production, consumption and resource use and has detrimental effects on the natural environment and human health. It is unlikely that a long-lasting, absolute decoupling of economic growth from environmental pressures and impacts can be achieved at the global scale; therefore, societies need to rethink what is meant by growth and progress and their meaning for global sustainability. Below the surface of apparent normality, the reality is stark: we face increasing resource scarcity, ecosystem disruption, climate change, mass extinction, pollution, democratic decline, and geopolitical instability.

Mortality is expressed either as   or  .  are deaths that occur before a person reaches an expected age. This expected age is typically the life expectancy for a country, stratified by sex and age. Premature deaths are considered preventable if their cause can be eliminated.  is defined as the years of potential life lost because of premature death. YLL is an estimate of the number of years that people in a population would have lived had there been no premature deaths. The YLL measure considers the age at which deaths occur; therefore, the contribution to the total number of lost life years is higher for a premature death occurring at a younger age and lower for a premature death occurring at an older age.  is the state of having a disease, measured by, for instance, the prevalence of a disease in a population. In this briefing, morbidity is expressed as   meaning years of healthy life lost to disability.   The   sets the 2030 target of improving air quality, with a focus on PM , in order to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by air pollution in the EU by a minimum of 55%, relative to those in 2005. Having a look at the past trend, from 2005 to 2020, premature deaths in the EU attributable to PM  exposure above the WHO guideline level fell by 45% (see  ). Should air quality continue to improve at this rate and the number of premature deaths continue to fall at a comparable rate in the future, the target would be achieved by 2026. However, this estimation is based purely on the assumption that the observed trend will continue. It is not a projection, since it does not factor in any recent policy developments or additional efforts taken to improve air quality since 2020.   To estimate premature deaths, all-cause (natural) mortality is considered in people over 30 for concentrations above the 2021 WHO guideline level of 5 µg/m , assuming a linear increase in the risk of mortality of 8% for a 10 μg/m  increase in concentrations of PM . The evolution in the number of premature deaths is based on the continuation of the past rate of reduction in premature deaths. Continuously reducing particulate matter concentrations in ambient air over the next decade will be challenging. To meet the target, Member States will need to fully implement their national air pollution control programmes (NACPCs), as well as measures needed to reach the 2030 climate and energy targets ( ). In terms of exposure, an increasingly ageing and urbanising European population counteracts some of the health gains associated with the reduction in ambient air pollution concentrations. Firstly, older people are more sensitive to air pollution. Secondly, a higher rate of urbanisation typically means that more people are exposed to PM  concentrations, which tend to be higher in cities.   The WHO   refer to concentrations of key air pollutants above which adverse health effects are known to occur. They offer quantitative, health-based recommendations for air quality management and provide an evidence-based tool for policy makers working on air quality. The WHO air quality guidelines also include ‘interim targets’ — levels associated with a qualified reduction in the risk to health — that inform the development of pollution reduction policies that are achievable in realistic timeframes in highly polluted areas. WHO recommends that ‘the interim targets be regarded as steps towards the ultimate achievement of air quality guideline levels in the future, rather than as an end target’. Since 2014, the EEA has been estimating mortality due to exposure to air pollution, with support from our European Topic Centres. Mortality is the most serious health outcome of exposure to air pollution, with robust scientific evidence of causality and for which data are more widely available. At the same time, studies increasingly show that ambient air pollution is also associated with morbidity due to several chronic conditions, such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( ). As a result, the share of morbidity in the total burden of disease for selected diseases is considerable.  Concentration-response functions are used to attribute a health risk to exposure to air pollution. These functions are based on epidemiological studies and estimate the increase in risk per unit of concentration of a certain air pollutant. As an example, the concentration-response function for mortality from exposure to PM  used in this briefing assumes a linear increase in the relative risk of mortality of 8% per 10 µg/m  increase in the annual mean concentration of PM  (as recommended in  ).  So far, the EEA used the concentration-response functions for mortality recommended by WHO in their 2013 report on the  . In this briefing, EEA applies for the first time the concentration-response functions for mortality set out in the  . For both PM  and O  the risk of mortality associated with incremental increases in concentrations is now higher, while for NO  the associated risk is slightly lower. An increased risk of mortality will increase the estimates of premature deaths per unit of air pollution, while a decreased risk will do the opposite.  An additional change to the method of calculating mortality has to do with the range of concentrations considered. Until 2021 and based on the  , all concentrations were considered for PM ; only concentrations above 20 µg/m  were considered for NO  and only concentrations above 70 µg/m  for O . Following the  , the main analysis presented in this briefing calculated mortality for concentrations above 5 μg/m  for PM  and above 10 μg/m  for NO . These values correspond to the new air quality guideline levels, below which the level of uncertainty surrounding the concentration-response functions is higher. This change reduces premature death estimates, since health impacts below the WHO guideline levels are not accounted for (although they are considered in a sensitivity analysis). Regarding O , the concentration from which premature deaths are calculated remains unchanged at 70 µg/m .  Note that the estimates of premature deaths presented here may differ from others calculated at national and European levels due to differences in methodological choices. As an example, the estimated number of premature deaths presented in this assessment is higher than those presented in the Study to support the impact assessment for a revision of the EU Ambient Air Quality Directives ( ). The kinds of methodological choices that can affect estimates of premature deaths include: The EEA uses concentration maps with the same resolution and applies the same assumptions for all of Europe, enabling a robust comparison across European countries.  For morbidity, years lived with disability (YLD) were estimated for ten pollutant-disease pairs. For these pairs, scientific evidence of an association between exposure to a specific air pollutant and the disease is robust and enough data for the estimations were available. Morbidity was calculated for the European countries for which health data was also available. The number of countries varied between 23 and 35, depending on the disease. For PM , morbidity was estimated for: For NO , morbidity was estimated for: For O , estimates were calculated for the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases.   In 2020 in the EU-27: In 2020 in Europe (please see the countries considered in tables 2 and 3):   It is important to note that the numbers of premature deaths presented here do not capture possible additional deaths caused by exposure to PM  and NO  concentrations below the respective 2021 WHO guideline levels (for which the scientific evidence is less certain than for health impacts above the WHO guideline levels). Furthermore, there is no evidence of a threshold below which air pollution does not impact health. With this in mind, EEA has also performed a sensitivity analysis of premature deaths for exposure to PM  and NO  at concentrations above 0 µg/m . For O , premature deaths were calculated for exposure to concentrations above 20 µg/m . This enables comparison with results in previous EEA assessments on the impact of air pollution on health (where the old methodology was used). The level of uncertainty around these estimates is higher than for the estimates of health impacts presented above. Table 1 presents the potential additional premature deaths and potential total premature deaths by pollutant for the EU-27 and for the larger number of European countries included in the assessment. The EEA table   presents, for all considered countries and the different aggregations, the estimates from 2005 to 2020 of the premature deaths attributable to exposure to PM , NO  and O  . It takes into account the methodology used until last year, the current methodology and the one used for the sensitivity analysis.    presents the total country population, the population-weighted mean concentrations and the estimated number of attributable premature deaths by country in 2020.  presents the YLL and YLL per 100,000 inhabitants associated with exposure to PM , NO  and O  concentration levels in 2020. When comparing 2020 to 2019, the number of premature deaths attributable to air pollution increased for PM  but decreased for NO  and O . Apart from the changes in concentrations and demographics, the number of premature deaths was also influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 incremented the number of natural deaths in 2020. For PM , falls in concentrations were counteracted by an increase in deaths due to the pandemic. In the case of NO , significant falls in concentrations were seen as a direct result of reductions in road transport during COVID-19 lockdowns ( ). The impact lower concentrations had in terms of reducing mortality countered the excess deaths due to COVID-19. The sections below provide information at country level on the health impacts of key pollutants   For PM , the highest absolute numbers of premature deaths in 2020 were seen in Italy, Poland, Germany, Romania and Spain, in order of decreasing rank. When considering YLL per 100,000 inhabitants, the highest relative numbers were observed in central and eastern European countries. This is where the highest concentrations of PM  were also observed; namely, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Bulgaria, in order of decreasing rank. The lowest relative health impacts due to PM exposure were seen in countries situated in the north and north-west of Europe, including Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.   For NO  the highest absolute numbers of premature deaths in 2020 were seen in Türkiye, Italy, Germany, Spain and France, in order of decreasing rank. When considering YLL per 100,000 inhabitants, the highest relative numbers were observed in Bulgaria, Türkiye, Romania, Greece and Serbia, in order of decreasing rank. The lowest relative health impacts due to NO exposure were seen in Estonia, Iceland, Finland, Sweden and Denmark. The countries with the highest absolute numbers of premature deaths in 2020 due to exposure to O  were Italy, Germany, France, Spain and Türkiye, in order of decreasing rank. The countries with the highest rates of YLL per 100,000 inhabitants were Albania, Montenegro, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia, in order of decreasing rank. The countries with the lowest relative impacts were Iceland, Finland, Ireland, Norway and Sweden.   The following section presents estimates of morbidity for the diseases that entail the most significant health burden; namely, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for PM  and diabetes mellitus (also known as Type 2 diabetes) for NO . For O , the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory disease in adults aged 65 was used as a proxy for morbidity.   These results are based on the ETC/HE report. Estimating the morbidity related environmental burden of disease due to exposure to PM , NO  and O  in outdoor ambient air ( ). It estimated the morbidity associated with ten pollutant-disease pairs in 2019. For these pairs, the scientific evidence of an association between exposure to a specific air pollutant and the disease is robust and enough health data for the calculations were available. In 2019, the morbidity effects of   in adults aged 25 and above resulting from exposure to   in 30 European countries was estimated at 175,702 YLD. The highest absolute burden was seen in Germany with 38,460 YLDs; in contrast, the lowest was in Iceland with less than 10 YLDs. When accounting for population, the highest rates were seen in Serbia (90 YLD per 100,000 inhabitants), Lithuania (85 YLD per 100,000 inhabitants) and Croatia (81 YLD per 100,000 in habitants). The lowest rates were seen in Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Iceland (see Figure 2).   In 2019, the morbidity effects of   in adults aged 35 and above resulting from exposure to   in 31 European countries was estimated at 175,070 YLDs. The highest absolute burden from diabetes mellitus was seen in Türkiye, with 54,186 YLDs. The lowest was in Iceland with 18 YLDs. When accounting for population, the highest rates were seen in Türkiye (146 YLDs per 100,000 inhabitants), Cyprus (76 YLDs per 100,000 inhabitants) and Greece (61 YLDs per 100,000 inhabitants). The lowest rates were seen in Estonia, Sweden and Denmark (see Figure 3).   For O , the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory disease in adults aged 65 and above was used as a proxy for morbidity (since no study was identified linking the incidence or prevalence of diseases to exposure to O ). In 2019, a total of 12,253 hospital admissions were attributable to exposure to O  across 23 European countries. The highest absolute number of hospital admissions was estimated for Italy (3,059) and the lowest number for Iceland (<10). The highest numbers of hospital admissions by population attributable to exposure to O  were seen in Austria (29 per 100,000 inhabitants), Spain (28 per 100,000 inhabitants) and Italy (22 per 100,000 inhabitants). The lowest rates were observed for Iceland, Latvia and the Netherlands (Figure 4).   The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing This narrative is part of a series called ‘ ’ published by the EEA’ Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a year of involuntary as well as voluntary change. While there is still no consensus on how the infectious agent SARS-CoV-2 emerged, the study by Cheng et al. (2007) has been put forward as an example of an early warning. They wrote: Coronaviruses are well known to undergo genetic recombination, which may lead to new genotypes and outbreaks. The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. The possibility of the re-emergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored (Cheng et al., 2007, p.683). Human progress depends on the ability and willingness to learn from the past. The way early warnings of environmental and human hazards emerge, and how they are dealt with, provides us with many ‘late’ lessons (EEA, 2001, 2013). These lessons can help pave the way towards more resilient and better-prepared societies. Previous EEA reports describe cases of unintended environmental hazards caused by the use of chemicals or other activities (EEA, 2001, 2013). These late lessons mainly highlight the need for precautionary approaches and how to strike a balance between desired economic opportunities and uncertain environmental harm. Plagues and pandemics have occurred throughout human history (Waltner-Toews, 2020). However, today’s globalised societies and economies, and the way we interact with the natural environment, affect the way pandemics develop. There is little doubt that new pathogens are often created at the interfaces between wild and domestic animals and humans, and that these sometimes manifest as zoonotic disease (Figure 1). According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2020), ‘60 per cent of known infectious diseases in humans and 75 per cent of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic’, while at least six outbreaks of novel coronaviruses were observed in the last century. Several interacting drivers underpin the emergence of zoonotic diseases by creating novel and diverse contacts among wildlife, livestock and people. These include (1) population growth and rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation, (2) increasing demand for animal protein, with a consequent increase in exploitation of wildlife, agricultural intensification and trade, (3) inadequate husbandry practices and (4) poorly managed informal wildlife and fresh produce markets, and industrial meat processing plants (UNEP, 2020). It is also clear that today’s high levels of international trade and travel make pathogens spread faster, as ‘diseases can now move around the world in periods shorter than their incubation periods’ (UNEP, 2020). : EEA (2020a), adapted from Jones et al. (2013) More attention is also being paid to these complexities in policy fields outside epidemiology and public health, as health crises like COVID-19 have far-reaching implications for people and society at large. The Council of Europe recently addressed the relationship between pandemics and democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law. It reminds us that the COVID-19 crisis should not be used as a pretext for restricting the public’s access to information, and that emergency measures taken by Member States should not undermine EU’s founding values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Council of Europe, 2020). One positive thing that we’ve learned from COVID-19 is that contemporary societies are in fact able to ‘act with necessary force’ when required (Mahmood and Sanchez, 2020). New regulations can be quickly enforced, with certain social practices and economic activities even being prohibited. Airports, restaurants, sports arenas and schools can be closed overnight if the reason is considered legitimate (at least when it is seen as temporary). EU Member States have willingly taken measures against COVID-19 that have had enormous economic costs, along with creating the risk of economic recession and severe unemployment. The global community will need years, if not decades, to assess the full extent of COVID-19 and its implications for our society, including its impacts on inequalities, health and the well-being of citizens (EEA, 2020b). Unprecedented national lockdowns, travel restrictions and the closing of national borders in the first half of 2020 and since have led to short-term improvements in the environment in Europe. Reductions in traffic, shipping and aviation led to sudden improvements in air quality and noise levels, with the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO ) in some cities declining by up to 60% compared with the same period in 2019 (EEA, 2020c). The pandemic also had the immediate effect of encouraging people to choose more active modes of travel. The increase in cycling in particular has prompted cities to become more bike friendly, including by introducing new cycling infrastructure (Kraus and Koch, 2021; Nikitas et al., 2021). A reduction in human activity gave habitats the chance to recover and species the opportunity to occupy new spaces and niches (EEA, 2020d). Moreover, preliminary data show that EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decreased by 10% from 2019 to 2020 (EEA, 2021a). As a society, we should learn from past experiences. The 2008-2009 financial crisis led to lower emissions, but the effect was short-lived (Peters et al., 2012). Now, once again, the imperative to emerge from economic recession and the apparent resilience of unsustainable political and economic priorities provide little hope that the post-corona planet will be more sustainable, unless there is an active and conscious change in social and economic practices. : EEA (2021c) During the pandemic, we have struggled with and learned to cope with the crisis. For a time, we changed our daily actions and reoriented our priorities, valued things differently and perhaps appreciated the natural world around us more. Yet, the question remains as to whether we have changed in any fundamental way. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the systemic frailty of our global economy and society (EEA, 2020e). It is not going too far to say that we are currently living in a world characterised by multiple global crises: a health crisis, an economic and financial crisis, a climate crisis and a crisis in nature (EEA, 2020e). One thing that the history of pandemics has taught us is that more pandemics should be expected (Waltner-Toews, 2020) and we should at the very least be prepared. ‘COVID-19 is not only a wake-up call, it is a dress rehearsal for the world of challenges to come […] The pandemic has taught us that our choices matter. As we look to the future, let us make sure we choose wisely.’ A. Guterres (2020), Secretary-General of the United Nations Taking the early warning from Cheng et al. (2007) seriously would mean considering a range of measures globally, including tackling illegal wildlife trade, closing down illegal food markets, tightening the regulation of industrial meat production, changing social and cultural food practices and, ultimately, changing unsustainable patterns of consumption, urbanisation and natural habitat destruction (IPBES, 2020). As highlighted by the OECD (2021), returning to business as usual would mean missing a vital opportunity to tackle underlying and interconnected environmental, economic, social and relational challenges that pre-date COVID-19. A well-being approach could guide the process of ‘building back better’ (OECD, 2021), especially if underpinned by the realisation that environmental health is a prerequisite for public health. We do not lack knowledge or ideas for action. The limiting factor is agency, the agency to address the driving forces underpinning this and other global crises. The next crisis, whatever form it takes, is likely to reveal itself for what it is: yet another symptom of the same underlying problem — unsustainable human production and consumption (EEA, 2020e). It is this chronic problem that continues to express itself in challenges that are framed either as ‘issues’ — to be addressed in premeditated policy cycles — or as ‘crises’ — requiring extraordinary and emergency measures (Lakoff, 2017). Therefore, our societies’ governance approaches should address not only the underlying roots of the problems themselves, but also the increasingly frequent or even simultaneous emergence of what we used to think of as exceptional crises. To address the sustainability problem we face, social and economic practices must change across different levels and aspects of society: the way we live our lives and the way we eat, move and power our societies cannot remain the same. While enduring COVID-19 lockdowns, French anthropologist and philosopher Bruno Latour proposed an exercise of reflection (Latour, 2020). He suggested that we consider which suspended activities we would like to see gone for good and which we would like to resume; which brand-new activities or habits we would like to develop in the aftermath of the pandemic; and how workers or entrepreneurs disenfranchised by a reshaped economy might be helped to transition into other, more sustainable or more resilient roles or activities. While this exercise can be performed individually, it also gives rise to fundamental questions that deserve attention at institution level. Given the wide recognition that sustainability transitions depend on certain practices being phased out (EEA, 2019), the exercise could even serve as inspiration for the further development and implementation of the European Green Deal. COVID-19 triggered sudden and forceful action. Emergencies have their own dynamics and risks, not least to democracy and legality. Yet, we have seen that, where there’s a will, there’s a way. Reflecting on the unprecedented mobilisation and impact of responses to COVID-19 can inspire new ways of thinking and help humanity to seize the moment and make a change. If we can temporarily shut down parts of society to survive the threat of COVID-19, it seems entirely reasonable that we can make significant societal changes to prevent COVID-22, -25 or -30, not to mention the other threats due to climate change and environmental degradation that we will most likely face.

News The EEA briefing ‘ ’ reflects on how social and technological innovation could contribute to more sustainable societies by avoiding technology-sourced, man-made environmental problems, and by shifting emphasis from technology-driven to people-driven solutions. New governance mechanisms and balancing experimentation and precaution can channel the potential of different types of innovation towards sustainability. Many sustainability-driven technologies promise positive outcomes, but the consequences of such innovations are difficult to anticipate, the EEA briefing points out. For example, large-scale production of first-generation biofuels resulted in deforestation and other land use changes that affected ecosystems and biodiversity. Problems arise also when improved efficiency leads to increased consumption or when technological innovations lead to lock-ins and path dependency. The EEA briefing argues for an innovation governance that enables citizens and societies to participate and engage in positive, transformative change beyond consumer choices. The new briefing is part of the ‘ ’ series, which brings new perspectives to the fore that could trigger change in the way we think and act towards sustainability. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

There has been growing interest in systems thinking and anticipatory knowledge within EU institutions in view of designing better-informed and ultimately more effective policies.   In order to explore even further the characteristics, interactions and potential implications of the ‘drivers of change’, the EEA has developed and identified six thematic clusters using the STEEPV framework (i.e. society, technology, economy, environment, politics and values):               , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Article Europe, like the rest of the world, is facing an unprecedented public health crisis, quickly spreading across the continent. News channels report regular updates on the number of people who are affected and lost their lives. European and national authorities have been implementing drastic measures to limit and slow down the spread of Covid-19. Restrictions on travelling, commuting and social gatherings are severely impacting several key economic sectors. Many flights are cancelled, and schools, restaurants and borders are closing. The term ‘lock-down’ captures the new reality in many European countries. A The first and foremost priority is to minimise the impacts on Europeans’ health and ensure the best possible provision of health services to those affected, followed by ensuring well-being, including jobs and livelihoods.  In this difficult period, the EEA has been asked on many occasions about the impact of Covid-19 measures on the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions. One of the unintended outcomes of such abrupt socio-economic shocks may be extra reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  .  In many of our reports, we have underlined the link between the economic performance of some sectors and environmental impacts. This current crisis is expected to have a strong effect on production and consumption patterns, such as reducing demand on mobility, including international aviation and daily commuting by private cars. However, to have a clearer understanding of the extent, the duration, as well as some expected and unexpected effects, we need to analyse the data in various domains after we get out of the crisis. The EEA is planning to assess these links and will share the results of such analysis in due course.  However, without a fundamental transformation of our production and consumption systems, any emission reduction triggered by such economic crises is likely to be short-lived and come at an extremely high cost to society. Europe aims to achieve climate neutrality through gradual and irreversible emission reductions and by setting long-term objectives to build a resilient economy and a resilient society, and not through disruptive shocks. This current crisis shows why we also need the transition to be a just one, offering new opportunities and support to those most affected. Earlier this month, the European Commission proposed the  , which aims to establish a long-term framework, complementing existing legislation, to achieve climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050. The European Union already has one of the most ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, supported by a comprehensive legislative package. What makes this proposal unique is that it makes climate neutrality by 2050 a legally binding target. When adopted, the European Union and its Member States will be required by law to comply and take the necessary measures to achieve it. The European Union has been reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the last three decades. The EEA's   shows that in 2018, EU greenhouse gas emissions were 23.2% below 1990 levels. It also asserts that extra effort and additional measures are needed to achieve the current 2030 target, set as ‘at least 40% reduction below 1990 levels’. Despite these reductions, the Europe’s Environment — state and outlook 2020 ( ) report  concludes that to tackle environmental degradation and climate change, we need to transform fundamentally the way we produce and consume goods and services. These findings confirm the urgent need for speeding up and scaling up transitions in key systems, including energy, food and mobility. The European Climate Law proposal, which is one of the key components of the European Green Deal, is put forward against this background and raises the EU’s ambition level even higher. The proposal requires the European Commission to review the current 2030 target and ‘explore options for a new 2030 target of 50 to 55% emissions reductions compared to 1990’. It also outlines how  . In addition to mitigation efforts, the proposal foresees regular assessments of climate adaptation measures. These climate objectives cannot be achieved without tackling the overarching sustainability challenge. Just as the European Commission is coming forth with other initiatives under the European Green Deal umbrella, including on circular economy, biodiversity and sustainable finance, our work addresses a number of areas to support sustainability transitions. Even if it results in significant temporary reductions in emissions, Covid-19 is and will remain a serious public health crisis. Covid-19 and its multiple impacts on our society cannot in any way be perceived as an event with positive outcomes. Even those of us who, based on our expertise and knowledge, have been vocal and calling for serious changes in our systems of production and consumption, should not see the massive shut down of our society as an acceptable solution to urgent and systemic sustainability challenges. The question remains:  ? I think we can. In my opinion, a socially just transition planned and implemented over a long term is the only way forward to build a resilient society with a strong and sustainable economy. Moreover, the investments we will make to mitigate the economic impacts of this crisis should be, and can be, fully aligned with our long-term sustainability goals. Even during these trying times, the European institutions have confirmed their strong commitment to the long-term objectives of the European Green Deal. This will require strong partners, and that is exactly what the EEA aims to be.

Definitions of key general terms and concepts are provided, followed by definitions of specific terms used as part of the EEA’s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability. (to urban environmental sustainability transitions) Difficulties that may be preventing some cities from reaching their sustainability potential or from overcoming long-standing economic, institutional and cultural challenges leading to suboptimal environmental outcomes and preventing more radical change from taking place. Key qualities that contribute to urban environmental sustainability. Depending on the context and enabling factors, different building blocks will be the inputs required to transition towards urban environmental sustainability. One of the four main components of the EEA’s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks). A model of production and consumption that aims to maintain the value of products, materials and resources for as long as possible by returning them to the product cycle at the end of their use while minimising the generation of waste.  A large and densely populated urban settlement. A city is defined in relation to a political level (administrative boundary) and a densely populated ‘urban centre’ (population > 50 000).  A circular model of resource management in which products, materials, built assets and land are kept in use while maintaining their value. It also means minimising waste generation.  The additional benefits above and beyond the direct benefits intended from the main action or measures to improve urban environmental sustainability. Sometimes referred to as ‘multiple benefits’ or ‘synergies’.  One of a range of terms describing formations of cities that are used in the literature and by different organisations. Compact cities have a range of potential benefits, including dense development patterns, better accessibility to local services and jobs, short intra-urban distances and public transport systems that make positive contributions to the efficiency of infrastructure investments, reductions in energy consumption and CO  emissions, knowledge diffusion and economic growth. A way of breaking down the complex concept of urban environmental sustainability into its key components and interrelationships to help provide the EEA with a clear structure for its thinking, including in terms of: The range of current and historical physical, social and institutional characteristics that create and shape the setting in which a specific city exists, develops and functions. Each city’s context has a considerable influence on its transition to urban environmental sustainability. One of the four main components of the EEA’s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks). Factors that encourage cities to transition to urban environmental sustainability and facilitate some cities to reach their sustainability potential. Factors that lead to positive environmental outcomes and support more radical change.  Relatively high-level forces that, based on their level of availability, facilitate (drivers) or hinder (barriers) the transition towards urban environmental sustainability. One of the four main components of the EEA’s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks). Consists of a city and its commuting zone. Functional urban areas therefore consist of a densely inhabited city and a less densely populated commuting zone whose labour market is highly integrated with the city.  A strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services (as defined by the European Commission’s communication on green infrastructure — EC, 2013). Green infrastructure is present in both rural and urban settings. In urban areas, many different features may be part of green infrastructure (e.g. parks, gardens, grassy verges, green walls or green roofs) in so far as they are part of an interconnected network and are delivering multiple ecosystem services. These green urban elements (or blue if aquatic ecosystems are concerned) may be found within the city and in its peri-urban area.  The outcome of the economic stimulus packages and recovery plans that governments have put in place to bring about a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that is both green and inclusive. This will, for example, create opportunities for income, jobs and growth, and at the same time accelerate action on medium- and long-term environmental goals, both national and global.  A range of perspectives on urban environmental sustainability that represent priority issues/concerns reflecting the EEA’s environmental remit and that can be used to guide/focus assessment and analysis. One of the four main components of the EEA’s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks). An urban reform movement that gained prominence in the 1990s and seeks to promote urban qualities that reformers have been seeking for over a century: vital, beautiful, just, environmentally benign human settlements.  Nexus— the interlinkages and interrelationships between two or more systems (e.g. food and energy) or policy areas relevant to urban environmental sustainability. Nexus analysis— the identification and analysis of the interactions, interrelationships and interdependencies among sectors and policies or other interventions. Nexus approach— the consideration of two or more urban policy areas in order to address a specific urban environmental sustainability problem or to advance a policy objective. By identifying priority synergies, co-benefits and trade-offs, opportunities can be identified for better coordinated and integrated policymaking and action. The achievement of a fulfilled human life in cities. It can be highly subjective and dependent on people’s individual circumstances and comprises both material (e.g. food, water and energy security) and non-material (e.g. equity, freedom of choice, enjoyment of natural beauty) dimensions.  The capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems to reduce their exposure to, prepare for, cope with, recover better from, adapt to and transform, as necessary, in response to the impacts of climate change.  Buildings that have high levels of energy and resource efficiency and reduce environmental impacts across their life cycle. Their users enjoy better health and well-being and productivity gains. In turn this translates into cost savings  The way in which cities and national governments can foster more growth that protects environmental quality and creates thriving, low-carbon and climate‑resilient communities that promote economic vitality, health, well-being and social inclusion. Sustainable, large-scale changes in complex adaptive systems (e.g. cities) and their underlying structures and supporting mechanisms (e.g. policies, routines, relationships, resources, power structures and values). An antonym of co-benefits. Disbenefits that arise that have to be weighed up against the direct benefits intended from the main action or measures to improve urban environmental sustainability.  The fundamental and structural changes in urban systems through which persistent environmental and societal challenges are addressed.  The ease with which people can reach goods, services and activities and connect with one another. In urban areas, accessibility is considered high when households can reach a wide variety of destinations in a short time and at a low cost per unit of travel. Areas, including cities but also smaller urban settlements and suburban areas, developed for residential, industrial or recreational purposes.  Urban sustainability from an environmental perspective achieved by focusing on environmental issues in urban areas, such as air and water pollution, green spaces providing space for people and nature, biodiversity loss, resource efficiency, and mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and manage the impacts of climate change.  A city’s physical characteristics as determined by physical elements, morphology, buildings, open spaces, expectant zones and the transport infrastructure. Allowing people and goods to move freely and safely in towns and cities while respecting the environment, which is crucial both for quality of life and for the health of the economy. It involves tackling challenges such as traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, air and noise pollution, health issues, safety risks and security threats. Urban, city or town planning is the planning discipline dealing with the physical, social, economic and environmental development of metropolitan regions, municipalities and neighbourhoods. The expression ‘urban planning’ covers developing land use and building plans as well as local building and environmental regulations.  Incorporating energy- and resource-efficient technologies and approaches into buildings that also bring co-benefits, such as reducing energy costs and creating healthier buildings for residents.  The physical pattern of the low-density expansion of large urban areas into the surrounding agricultural areas under certain market conditions. Sprawl lies in advance of the principal lines of urban growth and implies little planning control of land subdivision. Development is patchy, scattered and strung out, with a tendency to discontinuity because it leap-frogs over some areas, leaving agricultural enclaves. An adaptive process of addressing economic (e.g. economic equity), social (e.g. resilience to climate change impacts), environmental (e.g. reduced air pollution) and governance (e.g. ensuring citizens’ active participation in carrying out urban functions) issues in an integrated way within and beyond urban areas.  Multiscale, interdependent, social, natural and engineered systems that affect human and planetary well-being across spatial (local to global) and temporal scales.  Urbanisation is a long-term process characterised by both an increasing share of the population living in towns and cities and the growth of urban areas.      (Based on Cramer, 2014.) C (Based on McHarg, 1995.) (Based on WHO,1998.) City in which the processes of development include a wide variety of citizens and activities and involve spatial, social and economic inclusion. City that has achieved or is moving towards achieving low-carbon practices in all aspects, including its economy, daily life (e.g. travel), politics and culture. City in which the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems is enabled to survive, adapt and grow in response to chronic stresses and acute shocks. Characteristics, patterns of behaviour and understanding of/attitude to issues shared by a group of people in urban areas and learned by socialisation. All cities have their own specific cultural and historical settings. Actions to achieve urban environmental sustainability need to recognise, adapt to or draw on culture to improve the design and implementation of new policy measures.  Data are raw, unorganised facts in various forms on relevant issues, whereas information is data processed, organised and/or structured so as to make it useful for forming knowledge on a subject, issue, event or process relevant to achieving the urban environmental sustainability transition. Accessible, relevant, compatible clearly presented and easy to understand data and information are central for identifying and promoting sustainable urban solutions, and for measuring and monitoring progress towards the urban environmental sustainability transition. (Drawn from Glasgow Caledonian University, 2021.) Management of public/government money and the process of acquiring funds through traditional (e.g. taxes, public-private partnerships) and innovative (e.g. micro-contributions/crowd-funding, land value capture) financial mechanisms to support green investments and the transition to urban environmental sustainability. Note that financing typically refers to how the upfront costs of building infrastructure, etc., are met, while funding refers to how it is paid for it over its life cycle. Access to sufficient, sustainable finance from various sources is necessary to develop, deliver and maintain sustainable and high-quality urban infrastructure and services and to support other programmes or actions for urban environmental sustainability transitions. (Drawn from Institute for Government, 2018.) The interaction between the formal institutions and those in civil society. Governance refers to a process whereby actors in society wield power, authority and influence and enact policies and decisions concerning public life and social upliftment. Public engagement, soft governance, transparency, accountability and integrated decision-making processes involving all relevant sectors, stakeholders (e.g. civil society platforms) and levels of government is crucial to support urban sustainability transitions. (Drawn from Global Development Research Center, 2021.) Key insights into urban environmental sustainability processes and their management and options for action held by individuals within a group or among groups. Knowledge supported by the education system, research, innovation, networks and training is essential to identify appropriate solutions to urban environmental sustainability issues.  Tools used to facilitate or support practices, processes and behaviours with different forms and in various areas of technological development, including education, construction, transport, energy, and information and communications. Technological innovation, and making better use of technology, can facilitate sustainability transitions in governance and various sectors by making urban systems more efficient, reducing resource use, supporting better informed decision-making processes, and monitoring the implementation of relevant policies.  (All definitions based on EEA, 2021a, 2021b.) Urban systems with the capacity to be resilient, adaptive and responsive to a variety of chronic stresses and acute shocks, reducing vulnerability to climate change and extreme events. High-quality buildings, public spaces and supporting physical infrastructure, such as water supply, energy networks and transport systems, that are built to last, properly integrated with the wider urban system and effectively support sustainable urban living. Community-led and decentralised networks, initiatives and partnerships that foster social innovation and enhance resilience and cohesion. Healthy urban biodiversity, ecology and ecological networks that benefit urban ecosystem services and enhance the resilience of the urban system. Materials and products used efficiently through reuse and recycling with the goal of eliminating the generation of waste. Energy used efficiently to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, reduce energy costs for citizens and cities, and help ensure security of energy supply. An interconnected network of natural and semi-natural areas, green or blue spaces and features that deliver a wide range of benefits to urban citizens while also enhancing biodiversity and helping to restore local ecosystems. An inclusive economy that is low-carbon, resource-conserving, diverse and circular and results in improved human well-being and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. High-quality housing stock that delivers good environmental performance and healthy homes for residents. Integrated, long-term spatial planning and design that delivers healthy, accessible, compact, economically competitive cities and sustainable, multifunctional urban peripheries that also effectively manage urban sprawl. Low energy consumption and demand from citizens and cities, achieved through pro-environmental behaviours and practices that use less energy. Empowerment of stakeholders and citizens in relevant aspects of decision-making and knowledge creation through timely engagement and meaningful participation across all sectors of society. A high proportion of cities’ energy needs produced from decentralised renewable sources ranging from small plants to community and household microgeneration produced close to the point of use. Natural resources used efficiently and operating within the limits of the planet to bring about economic benefits and promote healthier lives and job creation. Justice that protects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and gives them access to a good-quality environment. A well-connected urban environment based on public and active transport accessible to all, including those socially and economically disadvantaged.

Briefing   The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge of unprecedented proportions and cities are on the  . There is still considerable uncertainty about the longer-term impacts of the crisis on cities. However, a growing agenda of issues that will have to be tackled in the months and years ahead is emerging. All of the following will have an impact on environmental sustainability transitions in cities: This short briefing is unable to cover all of these important themes in detail. Instead it provides a brief overview of some of the main impacts that the pandemic has had on urban environmental sustainability and then summarises the key opportunities to align the recovery with the urgent transition towards more sustainable cities. There is a growing movement of cities in Europe actively committing to a green recovery from the crisis — supported by initiatives at the EU level such as  ,   and the new  . The EU’s ambition to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and its European Green Deal flagship initiative must stay on track. However, the profound societal and economic changes brought about by the crisis need to be recognised. Likewise, we need to ensure an inclusive recovery that recognises that the pandemic has   within individual cities and between cities.   While current efforts are rightly focused on tackling the immediate challenges of the pandemic, it is important to swiftly put in place approaches to recovery that are aligned with wider sustainability objectives. This will require active participation and full commitment at all levels of government. A central part of these approaches will be ensuring that local governments can play an active role in the recovery planning process at EU and national levels. Funding will also be urgently needed, e.g. by   directly for local governments. The economic fallout from COVID-19 has put local governments in a precarious situation in which increased expenditure and reduced revenues have led to major budget shortfalls that could jeopardise existing sustainability initiatives. For all European citizens, the pandemic has resulted in abrupt changes in daily routines that have had far-reaching consequences for cities and the wider sustainability of urban systems. Although the longer-term impacts require further investigation and will differ from one city to another, there are certain patterns that already serve as an important basis for debate and discussion. Figure 1 presents some examples of the key opportunities and challenges that COVID-19 presents for urban environmental sustainability in the immediate term (pandemic response phase) and in the longer term (recovery planning phase).         As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold and health concerns remain paramount, cities are already taking the first steps towards recovery and  . The aim is to enable cities to rebuild their economies, address complex social justice issues and tackle the climate and ecological crisis at the same time. The following four areas offer particularly promising avenues for confronting this triple crisis in cities. Although they are presented as separate issues here, recent  highlights the critical interdependencies between the different urban sectors and systems and the importance of taking an integrated approach that recognises the important nexuses between various urban interventions and the associated policy outcomes.  The pandemic allowed policy experiments to be undertaken at a previously unconceivable scale and demonstrated that mobility behaviour in cities is a lot more fluid than perhaps previously assumed. Over the past year, European cities have already created   of new cycle lanes, traffic-calming measures and car-free streets. There is an opportunity to build on this momentum by encouraging a modal shift and permanently reallocating road space to walking and cycling — and more green space —thereby avoiding a return to car-dominated cities with  . This will require new regulatory interventions that deter car use and encourage the uptake of public transport and active travel. Public transport will   and will need special attention, given the major revenue losses that threaten the long-term viability of entire public transport systems. The pandemic also highlighted the importance of ensuring more equitable access to key services. Although most of the   underpinning the 15-minute city are not new, the pandemic has clearly increased interest in the concept as a way to improve liveability, reduce carbon emissions and rebuild and future-proof urban communities. If cities are to embrace this model of urban proximity, we will need to reconsider how public and active transport is currently planned. There is a need to move away from radial transport to provide cycling networks that connect residential areas to the urban core and ensure better connections within and between the different areas. Source: C40 Climate Leadership Group, 2020, ‘ ’ . There is a major opportunity for cities to invest in retrofitting their ageing building stock. This can play a central role in supporting the European Green Deal ambition of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and meeting the goals of the new  . Collectively, buildings in the EU are responsible for  . Building retrofits have considerable co-benefits beyond reducing carbon emissions, including reduced operating costs and more comfortable and healthier buildings for residents. Retrofitting also has  , which can help to restart the economy. For example, Lille has announced a  , pledging EUR 35 million over the next 3 years for renovating 3 000 social housing units, more than 3 600 private homes and 600 student residences. Beyond green building retrofits, there will also be opportunities for cities to think creatively about repurposing buildings for alternative uses. A drastic reduction in tourist numbers has accelerated plans in some cities, such as Lisbon and Venice, to   to affordable housing. Given that the demand for city centre office space may never fully recover, some cities are exploring the potential for converting commercial buildings into housing or other uses. This will require leadership from the public sector and careful planning to ensure an appropriate mix of urban functions and land use and to update regulatory, zoning and taxation policy to enable this shift. The pandemic has certainly underscored the importance of designing  . Such buildings can be easily adapted to new uses without having to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch. This supports the EU’s ambition to increase the use of  . Urban green infrastructure provides multiple ecosystem services, supports climate change adaptation and plays a key role in improving people’s mental and physical well-being. Perhaps one of the most enduring legacies of the pandemic will be the renewed appreciation of high-quality public green spaces in cities and the importance of  , where air, water, soil and other natural resources are protected and nurtured while also increasing cities’ resilience to the effects of climate change. The ability of nature-based solutions to   local air quality is particularly relevant, given that evidence now suggests that   exacerbated the health impacts of COVID-19. As cities start designing and implementing pathways for recovery from the pandemic, nature-based solutions can provide   that create economic opportunities, employment and multiple public health and well-being benefits and have a transformative impact on urban ecosystems.  has also highlighted how investments in green infrastructure can help cities adapt to a rapidly changing climate and to the increasingly extreme weather events they have to confront as a result. In planning such interventions, cities will have to consider the  , and ensure that those urban communities that currently have the   to high-quality public and green spaces are prioritised. It is also important to ensure that urban greening policies are clearly linked to wider issues related to inequities in urban planning and development processes (e.g. uneven access to other urban services such as transport). Linking urban green space policies with other policy objectives, such as an expansion in urban food production, can be an important way of building greater resilience and ensuring that the co-benefits of interventions are maximised.  Food security is critical to urban environmental sustainability, and the pandemic has highlighted the importance of having a robust and resilient food system that can withstand sudden crises. The Commission’s   strategy seeks to develop a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system. Initiatives such as the   and the   have created platforms for cities to actively shape more sustainable, inclusive and resilient food systems. The pandemic has given a boost to initiatives embracing the value of growing local, organic and more seasonal food in and around urban areas. For example, Paris is expanding its   programme to support local urban farms, and it is explicitly linking access to locally grown food to its 15-minute city model. In Valencia, the   has become an immediate and direct source of fresh food for the city. In addition to increasing the availability of healthy produce, urban agriculture also reduces transport distances and the associated carbon emissions and has considerable climate adaptation, ecological, social and health  Local food production can also disrupt linear food systems and support cities’ efforts to move towards a more circular consumption model. This may be especially the case where cities also tackle other   such as food sourcing, designing and marketing healthier products, and dealing with food waste. Policies to promote local food production will need to consider its affordability for lower-income households, which often lack access to sufficient healthy food and fresh produce. A successful rethinking of urban food systems will therefore require coordinated policy and action across a complex nexus of sectors, including urban agriculture, spatial planning and social policy.  The early 2020s are likely to be a key turning point. The fiscal recovery packages and infrastructure investments being rolled out by city and national governments and the EU have the potential either to further entrench fossil fuel-intensive and ecologically damaging economic systems and ‘business as usual’ urbanisation patterns or to accelerate progress towards a zero-carbon, more inclusive future for Europe’s cities.   explores some of the drivers and barriers that European cities face in accelerating their transition to more environmentally sustainable patterns.  By investing in recovery measures that prioritise zero-carbon transport, energy-efficient buildings, green and blue infrastructure, more space for nature and more resource-efficient urban living, cities can increase their resilience to future crises and ensure a just transition for all of their residents. To be truly inclusive, recovery planning needs to understand and address existing social inequalities within local communities and ensure that the needs of all, including the most vulnerable, are met. Initiatives such as the   will be pivotal in placing cities at the centre of the European Green Deal. Cities have been at the forefront of responding to the pandemic, and there is growing recognition that European cities can be powerful agents of change in driving a sustainable recovery. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of both horizontal and vertical coordination of governance and the complex interlinkages between geographies, systems and policy areas. The   is a new instrument to strengthen integrated and participatory approaches to sustainable urban development and to provide a stronger link to relevant EU policies and, in particular, cohesion policy investments. EU recovery funding presents a significant opportunity for cities, but only if local governments and local citizens are properly consulted in the planning and execution of recovery initiatives.  Co-creating solutions with cities and their networks will be essential in ensuring that transformative actions can be scaled up. Networks and institutions such as  ,  , the  , the  ,   (Local Governments for Sustainability),  ,   (Council of European Municipalities and Regions) and others will play a key role in supporting cities on this journey. Opportunities for peer-to-peer learning will remain central to enabling cities to share challenges and lessons learnt in their recovery from the crisis. The Horizon Europe research programme will play a major role in driving innovation in cities with its ambitious goal of  . One important legacy of the crisis is likely to be the realisation that behaviours, institutions and even infrastructure can be changed a lot faster than we may have previously assumed. European cities are not as ‘locked in’ to certain ways of doing things as previously thought. If necessary, cities can radically transform how they operate and how we live within them. This has important implications for the ambitions that cities put forward to enable the transformational systems change that will be needed to tackle the climate and ecological crisis in the years to come.    Briefing no. 03/2021 Title: HTML -   - ISBN   - ISSN   - doi:  The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

These pollutants contribute to poor air quality, leading to significant negative impacts on human health and the environment. ", "content": "All official European Union website addresses are in the    domain.  entered into force on 31 December 2016. Replacing earlier legislation,  . The 2016 NEC Directive sets 2020 and 2030 emission reduction commitments for five main air pollutants. The directive transposes the reduction commitments for 2020 agreed by the EU and its Member States under the 2012 revised   under the   (Air Convention). The more ambitious reduction commitments agreed for 2030 are designed to reduce the health impacts of air pollution by half compared with 2005. Further, the Directive requires that the Member States draw up National Air Pollution Control Programmes that should contribute to the successful implementation of air quality plans established under the EU’s  . The NEC Directive highlights the importance of Member States regularly reporting air pollutant emission inventories for assessing progress in reducing air pollution in the EU and for ascertaining whether Member States are in compliance with their commitments. The directive introduces a number of new reporting requirements for Member States. These are defined in Annex I of the directive and include annual information on emissions of a number of pollutants: To ensure that information on emissions reported by Member States is consistent and harmonised with international requirements, the NEC Directive requires Member States to follow the methodologies agreed upon by the UNECE  . It also requires that Member States use the  k in preparing their inventories. Every year, the EEA publishes an annual status briefing that summarises the most recent reported data and progress of EU Member States in meeting their emission reduction commitments.

EU   were required to report a national air pollution control programme (NAPCP) by 1 April 2019. This included policies and measures (PaMs) that Member States selected as relevant for fulfilling their commitments to reduce emissions set for the periods 2020-2029 and from 2030 onwards. Actions taken to reduce emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases often address the same economic sectors but are reported separately under different EU legislation. An overview of the latest policies and measures reported by Member States to tackle air pollution, as required under the National Emission reduction Commitments (NEC) Directive are available  . Complete data set on policies and measures reported by Member States can be accessed in the  . The NEC Directive establishes a number of flexibilities (Article 5) that Member States may request to be applied for the purposes of assessing compliance with their emission reduction commitments. This includes an ‘adjustment’ process, in which Member States may ‘adjust’ downwards their emission inventories. The adjustment is applied if non-compliance with the national reduction commitments is caused by implementing an improved emission inventory methods in accordance with updated scientific knowledge. Member States wishing to adjust their data in this way must first notify the European Commission (EC) by 15 February each year, and subsequently submit a range of documentation (by 15 March each year) for review and decision by the European Commission."},

Policies to reduce air pollution have led to improved air quality in Europe over the last three decades. However, in some European cities air pollution still poses risks to health. You can use the European city air viewer to check   and to compare it with air quality in other cities across Europe.  Cities are ranked from the cleanest city to the most polluted,  based on average concentration levels of fine particulate matter,  (or PM ) over the past two calendar years. Fine particulate matter is the air pollutant with the highest impact on health in terms of premature death and disease. This tool is focused on   air quality, as  long-term exposure to air pollution causes the most serious health effects. In 2021, the  , and recommended a maximum level of 5 μg/m  for fine particulate matter for  exposure in order to protect health. In 2008, the European Union (EU) set an annual limit value for fine particulate matter of 25 μg/m under  . The Ambient Air quality   is currently under   to, among other things, align the EU standards more closely with the WHO recommendations. The viewer categorises air quality as: In Europe, we benefit from the most comprehensive air quality monitoring network in the world. Here we present levels of fine particulate matter in over  350 cities from across  . Data comes from on the ground measurements of fine particulate matter, taken by over  500 monitoring stations. If the city is not represented by a dot on the map, it means that the city could not be included in the viewer for one of the two reasons below. The dot representing a city on the map is grey when: Hover on a city on the map to see: The table ranks European cities according to their average levels of fine particulate matter over the past two full calendar years. Using the index to the right, y ou can click on the air quality categories, good, fair, moderate, poor and very poor, to display the cities with air quality in that category. Clicking on a city on the map shows a  view of the locations of the PM  monitoring stations, regardless of their type, in the city. The stations on the  map are represented according to the average concentration of PM  for the city as a whole. Hovering on the stations on the  map shows: The viewer presents cities as defined by the European Commission’s  , in its 2020 edition. This geospatial dataset includes cities with a population of over 50,000 inhabitants. A similar dataset is available for download from the    . We use data on concentration of fine particulate matter, or PM  reported to the EEA by our member countries under the European Union Ambient Air Quality Directives (2008/50/EC). Two types of data are used. In addition to the information available in the city viewer, a pop-up window provides links to country fact sheets from the Urban PM  Atlas, Air Quality in European Cities, 2023 Report, when you select a city on the map. These fact sheets contain detailed insights into the spatial (e.g., urban or national levels) and sectoral (e.g., transport, residential heating, or agriculture) contributions to air pollution in each urban area. They also highlight how targeted local and national measures can effectively reduce fine particulate matter levels, supporting the objectives of the EU’s Zero Pollution Action Plan. Particulate matter is the ambient air pollutant that has been most extensively researched and studies show that PM  has one of the highest impact on health in terms of premature death and disease. Long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with the most serious health outcomes, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, along with mortality.   To produce this tool, we use data from   and   air quality monitoring stations that are situated within the boundaries of the cities, as defined by the Urban Audit, and for which countries report data to the EEA. These stations provide a robust picture of the exposure of the population to air pollution in cities. Air quality is also measured at industrial stations and traffic stations. Data from these stations is not used for this tool, as they are used to measure levels in more polluted areas, such as around industrial sites or near motorways and major roads with dense traffic. As such, they measure the exposure of populations around major industrial areas and roads and do not estimate the exposure of the general population. In addition, industrial and traffic stations are unevenly distributed in cities across Europe, which might introduce bias when making comparisons. Nevertheless, concentrations at traffic stations are shown when clicking on the cities, as explained above. Air quality is also monitored in rural areas, with the aim, for instance, of understanding the impacts on crops and natural ecosystem. Rural stations, typically situated far from urban centers, are not included in this tool. For some cities, we do not have data for either step 1 or step 2. In such cases, we use the annual mean for the available year.   For data from a station to be included, a minimum of 75% temporal data coverage is required. This means that for an individual station, we consider those with more than 274 valid daily values per calendar year (or 275 days in a leap year). We display five categories of air quality, including good, fair, moderate, poor and very poor. These are defined by bandwidths of concentrations of fine particulate matter, as shown below. In their  , the World Health Organization established an annual air quality guideline for PM  exposure of 5 μg/m , as well as several interim targets. These values have been used to define the bandwidths for the five categories of air quality.  Interim target 1 35  Interim target 2 25  Interim target 3 15  Interim target 4 10  Interim target 5 5 : Adapted from  All measurement methods used have a degree of error. In particular, the up-to-date data (dataflow E2a) is not checked for outlying datapoints, which may be errors, and validated by the countries. This may introduce a limited number of more extreme values to the dataset.     In reporting the characteristics of monitoring stations to the EEA, countries may interpret the definitions of station types differently. This can reduce comparability between cities. It is assumed that all the urban and suburban monitoring stations in a single city represent background environments equally. The methodology does not account for the distribution of the urban population across the city. Treating stations equally may lead to an underestimate of the average concentration that the general population is exposed to, in the case where the area around a pollution hotspot is densely populated. In large cities with dense urban centres, where large parts of the population reside, stations in the city centre are likely to be traffic stations. Such stations are not included in the methodology, and this may lead to an underestimation of concentrations of fine particulate matter. Only measurements from urban and suburban stations that are in the urban audit geometries are considered in the calculations.                                          "},

Together, such policies have delivered progress in reducing the   of many pollutants from the transport sector. Between 1990 and 2022, emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO ) from transport across the EU-27 decreased by 51%, sulphur oxides (expressed as SO ) by 82%, carbon monoxide (CO) by 90%, methane (CH ) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by 76% and 91% respectively. In the same time frame, transport emissions of particulate matter (including non-exhaust emissions) with particle diameter of 10µm/2.5µm or less (PM ) decreased by 46%/58%, respectively.   The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had an influence on these figures, due to the significant reduction in transport volumes during 2020. However, many of the pollutant levels have rebounded.  At the same time, two air pollutants have demonstrated   in recent decades. Between 1990 and 2022, transport emissions of ammonia (NH ) increased by 121% (138% in 1990-2019) while nitrous oxide (N O) increased by 35%. Although transport contributions of NH  emissions are limited compared to other sectors such as agriculture, their impact on air quality, especially within cities, is reported to be very high . While a powerful greenhouse gas, N O is also currently considered a dominant ozone depleting substance  . Although most pollutant emissions declined since 1990, the situation is uneven across transport modes. This in part reflects differences in the stringencies of emissions standards.   has significantly reduced its pollutant emissions since 1990, with the exception of compounds NH  and N O. Their recent increase is mainly due to new catalytic systems for the reduction of NO  in diesel engines  and the use of enriched fuel mixtures to control NO  at high load in petrol engines . While a significant reduction can be seen for both PM  and PM , the non-exhaust fraction of these emissions (i.e. from brake and tyre wear or road abrasion) is increasing in percentage and constituted 75% and 59% of PM  and PM  emissions from road transport in 2022. Non-exhaust emissions will become even more relevant with the progressive decarbonisation of the sector and increases in vehicles mass due to batteries . Emissions from the   sector (i.e. including domestic and international), increased for most pollutants, with the exception of CH , CO, NMVOC, rebounding after the significant contraction in traffic volumes that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in emissions since 1990 ranged between 47% and 117%, depending on the compound considered.  Differences exist between domestic and international aviation trends for some pollutants (Figure 2). This can be partially explained by the difference in demand evolution and the technology used in domestic and international aviation . The aviation sector's reduction of air pollutant emissions is mainly done at engine design level since the application of advanced aftertreatment systems (as mentioned above) is technologically very challenging.   sector emissions from domestic navigation decreased during 1990-2022, for all pollutants considered (excluding CH , which increased by 7%). These reductions range between 88.7% and 0.3%, depending on the compound considered. Conversely, in international navigation most pollutants have increased, aside from PM , PM  and SO . This increase in emissions ranged between 5% and 58%, depending on the compound considered. In the maritime sector, many of the pollution reduction technologies already developed in the road sector could in principle be adapted to marine diesel engines. This would yield a significant reduction in air pollutants emissions from the sector with clear environmental benefits. The indicator measures the relative change (in %) in the emissions of different pollutants (CO, NO , NMVOC, SO , NH , CH , N O, PM , PM ) in the transport sector as a whole and for different subsectors. Relative variations were indexed with respect to year 1990 for all pollutants. For CO, NO , NMVOC, SO , NH , PM  and PM , data officially reported to the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP)/LRTAP Convention were used. For CH  and N O data officially reported under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and also under the Kyoto Protocol (KP) were used.   Where a complete time series of emission data has not been reported for CO, NO , NMVOC, SO , NH , PM  and PM , data have been gap filled according to the methodologies of the European Environment Agency's (EEA's) European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (ETC/ACC). Details of the gap-filling procedure for the air pollutant data set are described in the EU emission inventory report under the UNECE's Convention on LRTAP. Similarly, for CH  and N O additional information on the gap-filling procedure can be found in the Annual European Union greenhouse gas inventory and inventory report Submission to the UNFCCC Secretariat.   The mobility system contributes to overall air pollution emissions and air quality deterioration across Europe.

Air pollution damages health during childhood and increases the risk of disease in later life, according to the EEA ‘ ’ briefing. Air pollution is estimated to cause over   every year among those under the age of 18 across the EEA’s 32 member countries. Although the number of premature deaths in this age group is low relative to the  , deaths early in life represent a loss of future potential and come with a significant burden of chronic illness, both in childhood and later in life.  Children’s lung function and lung development are affected by air pollution, especially by   (NO ) in the short term, and by   (PM ) in the long term. Maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy is linked to low birth weight and risk of pre-term birth. After birth, ambient air pollution increases the risk of several health problems, including asthma, reduced lung function, respiratory infections and allergies. It also can aggravate chronic conditions like asthma, which afflicts 9% of children and adolescents in Europe, as well as increasing the risk of some chronic diseases later in adulthood. Until air pollution is reduced to safe levels overall, improving air quality around settings like   and during activities like school commutes and sports, can help reduce children’s exposure. Air pollution levels across Europe are still unsafe and European air quality policies should aim to protect all citizens, but especially our children, who are most vulnerable to the health impacts of air pollution. It is urgent that we continue to step up measures at EU, national and local level to protect our children, who cannot protect themselves. The surest way to keep them safe is by making the air we all breathe cleaner. In 2021, upwards of  was exposed to harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide, ozone and fine particulate matter (PM ).

According to preliminary data from 2022, central-eastern Europe and Italy reported the highest concentrations of both PM  due primarily to the burning of solid fuels like coal for domestic heating and their use in industry.

Under the European Green Deal’s  , the European Commission set the 2030 goal of reducing the number of premature deaths caused by PM  (a key air pollutant) by at least 55% compared with 2005 levels.

In 2021, 13 Member States met their respective 2020-2029 national emission reduction commitments under the EU’s National Emission reduction Commitments Directive (NECD) for each of the five main pollutants (nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulphur dioxide and fine particulate matter)  . Thirteen Member States failed to do so for at least one of the five main air pollutants (and one Member States did not report this year). The overall downward trend since 2005 comes despite economic growth over the same period.  The EEA briefing is based on the latest available data reported by Member States in 2023 for their 2021 emissions. It describes the progress made towards reducing emissions of the five main air pollutants regulated under the directive. It presents an assessment of Member State performance against the emission reduction commitments for 2020-2029 as well as their progress towards achieving the more ambitious reduction commitments that will apply from 2030 onward.   Achieving further reductions for 2030 and beyond will be a significant challenge for nearly all EU countries for nearly all pollutants, as the reduction rate for some pollutant emissions is now levelling off according to the briefing. One exception is sulphur dioxide, where many countries are already compliant with their 2030 reduction commitment. Sulphur dioxide emission contribute to acidification and is responsible for damage to ecosystems and buildings, among other detrimental effects.  Reducing ammonia emissions remains the biggest challenge. Ammonia emissions are a concern as they contribute to excessive nitrogen presence in water ecosystems leading to the known phenomenon of eutrophication, among other environmental negative impacts. Ammonia is also a precursor to fine particulate matter, very harmful to health. Ten Member States will have to reduce their ammonia emissions compared to 2021 levels to fulfil their 2020-2029 reduction commitments. The agriculture sector is the principal source, responsible for 93% of total ammonia emissions in the EU. Since 2005, ammonia emissions have only slightly decreased in many Member States and in some cases have even increased. The separate annual EU emission inventory report 1990-2021, also published today by the EEA, showed a continued downward trend in emissions for most main air pollutants, however emissions decreased more slowly from 2007 to 2021. The   looks at air pollutant emissions reported by the EU under the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (the Air Convention) and includes a wide range of substances. These include the five main air pollutants (NO , NMVOCs, SO , NH  and PM ) but also others such as heavy metals, black carbon or persistent organic pollutants. Under the National Emission reduction Commitments (NEC) directive 2016/2284, EU Member States are required to meet national commitments to reduce emissions for these five air pollutants to deliver clean air for human health and the environment.  The EEA analysis is based on the latest air pollutant emission inventory data, as reported by Member States in February 2023 both under the Directive and the UNECE Air Convention."},

These WHO recommended concentrations are set based on the level of pollution above which there is clear evidence of associated health effects.  The figures released today by the EEA remind us that air pollution is still the number one environmental health problem in the EU. The good news is that clean air policy works, and our air quality is improving. But we need to do better still, and bring pollution levels down further. That is why the EU must quickly adopt and implement the proposal for a revised Ambient Air Quality Directive that aims to align EU air quality standards more closely with WHO recommendations. While we have made great strides over past years to reduce air pollution levels, our latest data and assessment show that the  , resulting in deaths and illnesses which can be attributed to air pollution. The positive news is that authorities at European, national and local levels are taking action to reduce emissions through measures like promoting public transport or cycling in city centres, and through updated legislation. New in this year’s assessment is the quantification of the   to which air pollution contributes. The total health burden associated with each of these diseases depends not only on the attributable deaths linked to the disease but also on the health burden of living with the effects of the disease on a daily basis.  For some diseases such as  the majority of the health burden is linked to attributable deaths, but for other diseases such as diabetes and asthma there is also a significant health burden associated with living with the debilitating health effects of these diseases, typically over many years or decades. Therefore, when we consider the health effects of air pollution, it is important not only to focus on attributable deaths but also on the  that these diseases can have on the   of European citizens as they cope with the long-term effects of diseases such as asthma.   Of the considered air pollution-related illnesses, for exposure to   (PM ), the greatest health burden is caused by ischemic heart disease, followed by stroke, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and asthma.

Briefing Protecting children’s health is frequently cited as a key objective in major policies on climate and the environment such as the zero pollution action plan (European Commission, 2020). Though most children across EEA member countries are healthy (Eurostat, 2019; WHO, 2023), there are reasons for concern regarding environmental risks to their health. Children and adolescents are more susceptible than adults to most adverse environmental factors; in some cases they may be more exposed than adults too (Valent et al., 2004); and they can do little to change the situation or protect themselves. That is especially true for air pollution, the largest environmental risk for children in Europe. There are many factors that make children and adolescents especially vulnerable to air pollution. Children’s breathing rates are higher than those of adults and they also take in more air per kilogram of body weight. Because of their lower physical height, they breathe air closer to the ground where some pollutants, especially from traffic exhausts, are emitted and become concentrated. Their acquired dose of pollution is also elevated since they breathe faster and are often more physically active (Osborne et al., 2021). Moreover, children inhale a larger fraction of air through their mouths than adults. Due to this increased oral breathing, pollution penetrates deep into the lower respiratory tract, which is more permeable (US EPA, 2019). Children’s bodies and organs, including their lungs, are also still in development (Chen et al., 2015), which further increases risk. Furthermore, children’s developing immune systems are weaker than those of adults, strengthening the effects of pollution (WHO, 2018).    Air pollution is the contamination of indoor or outdoor air by any agent that modifies its natural characteristics. It comes from both natural and, particularly, man-made sources, which include everything from road traffic and residential heating exhausts, through to factory chimney stacks and a wide variety of other sources (EEA, 2022a, 2022c). Air pollution affects urban and rural areas, and comes in many forms, from ambient air particles, ozone and nitrogen oxides, to second-hand smoke (SHS), smoke from the burning of biomass in households, mould spores, mites and allergens, and toxic chemicals like formaldehyde (Trasande et al., 2016; Carreras et al., 2019; Rojas-Rueda et al., 2019; WHO, 2022). Some of the aforementioned pollutants and sources are more frequent or found at higher concentrations indoors. They are the subject of ongoing research at the EEA and findings will be summarised in forthcoming publications. Boxes 1 and 2 in this briefing provide some highlights on indoor air pollutants. This briefing however focuses on outdoor ambient air pollution, a term that is used interchangeably with ‘air pollution’ hereafter. Depending on the pollutant, different sources of ambient air pollution are the main drivers of exposure, as illustrated in Figure 2 below (EEA, 2022b). : EEA (2022a) . NMVOC: non-methane volatile organic compounds; NO : nitrogen oxides; PM : particles with a diameter smaller than 2,5 microns; PM : particles with a diameter smaller than 10 microns; SO : sulphur dioxide. Children’s and adolescents’ exposure to air pollutants partly mimics that of adults, but it also differs in specific ways. Children are already exposed to air pollution while in their mothers’ wombs, and after birth they are typically exposed to air pollution in child-centric settings such as: outside in the grounds of schools and kindergartens; in classrooms where ambient air pollution worsens indoor air quality; and during activities like commuting to school and afterschool activities. Smaller children are also exposed to air pollution closer to the ground, where the concentrations of some pollutants are higher. Children and adolescents tend to spend more time outdoors and are more physically active than adults, potentially increasing their exposure to ambient air pollution. In addition, as is the case with other environmental risks, poorer children tend to be systematically more exposed to and affected by air pollution (Fairburn et al., 2019) than their better-off counterparts.   Children are affected by ambient air pollutants from the womb through to adulthood. Every year in EEA member and collaborating countries, air pollution is estimated to cause over 1,200 deaths and the loss of over 110,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs, a measure of the burden of disease caused by a risk factor) among those aged under 18 (GBD Collaborative Network, 2020). These deaths, along with a significant burden from non-fatal diseases, are caused by air pollution through a variety of mechanisms and health outcomes, which are explored below. Before birth, ambient air pollution increases the risk of babies being smaller during pregnancy (a condition known as ‘small for gestational age’, or SGA) (Pun et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Nyadanu et al., 2022), having a low birth weight (Yang et al., 2020; Ghosh et al., 2021) as well as having an increased risk of pre-term birth (US EPA, 2020; Nyadanu et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022). All of these can increase the risk of different health problems later in life. Though the evidence is less clear, particulate matter has also been linked to an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and still births (Grippo et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2022). Despite solid epidemiological data, the biological mechanisms are not fully understood for most of the pre-natal risks of air pollution. After birth, ambient air pollution increases the risk of several types of adverse health outcomes for children and adolescents. For example, it increases the risk of respiratory infections in children, including acute lower respiratory infections, pneumonia, upper respiratory infections and otitis media (ear infections) (Mehta et al., 2013; Nhung et al., 2017; Bowatte et al., 2018; King et al., 2018; Låg et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Ziou et al., 2022). Short-term exposure to air pollution may also exacerbate allergies, including allergic rhinitis (runny nose), eczema and conjunctivitis (itchy eyes) in children (US EPA, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020). Children’s lung function and lung development are also affected by ambient air pollution, especially by ozone and nitrogen dioxide (NO ) in the short term, and by fine particles (PM ) in the long term. This effect can be seen both in healthy children and also in children with asthma, which can be exacerbated by pollution (US EPA, 2010, 2017, 2019, 2020; WHO, 2018, 2021a; Garcia et al., 2021; Holm and Balmes, 2022). Asthma affects over 9% of children in the EU (Selroos et al., 2015), placing a large burden on children, their families and societies. The risk of developing asthma itself and asthma-like symptoms is clearly linked to long-term exposure to air pollution (US EPA, 2010, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020; Zu et al., 2018; Låg et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Bettiol et al., 2021; Han et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022). This has been observed both in epidemiological studies and in the laboratory, where the mechanisms for this effect have been studied and confirmed. Asthma symptoms can range from mild to very severe, even life-threatening. Exposure to short term increases in air pollution increases the risk of asthma hospitalisation and emergency department visits for children (Mustafić et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2016; US EPA, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022). Ambient air pollution may also be linked to other types of health problems in children. For example, there is growing evidence that air pollution affects children’s brain development, contributes to cognitive impairment, and that it may play a role in the development of some types of Autistic Spectrum Disorders (US EPA, 2015, 2019, 2020; Dutheil et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Lin et al., 2022). Some studies have also observed a link between traffic-related air pollution, with benzene playing a key role, and leukaemia in children (Orsini et al., 2012; Filippini et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021).   In addition to ambient air pollution from traffic, heating, industry, etc., children’s health is also threatened by other airborne pollutants, like second-hand smoke and chemicals. Children can be exposed to these pollutants both outdoors and indoors.  Indoor air pollution (IAP): European children spend most of their time indoors, and indoor air pollution can significantly affect their health and well-being. Sources of IAP include: some building products and furnishings that release toxic chemicals; materials like some mineral fibres and legacy-asbestos still remaining in buildings; natural pollutants like radioactive radon. Outdoor air pollution also contributes to indoor air pollution, as does smoking, burning candles, allergens and dust, among others. Two types of air pollutants are of particular importance indoors: mould, and several types of toxic chemicals. Mould is a frequent indoor health hazard for adults and children alike, for whom it increases the risk of developing asthma, asthma exacerbation, wheeze, allergic rhinitis, and respiratory infections (Gern et al., 1999; Dick et al., 2014; Tham et al., 2014; Kanchongkittiphon et al., 2015; Sharpe et al., 2015; Hurraß et al., 2017; Fakunle et al., 2020, 2021). The concentrations of certain chemicals that are toxic for adults and children, such as formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds (VOC), flame retardants, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) tend to be much higher in indoor air. However, our knowledge of the sources, concentrations, status of, and trends in indoor air pollution in Europe lags far behind that of outdoor air pollution. Second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS): there is no safe level of SHS exposure, and children are particularly vulnerable to it both before and after birth (Öberg et al., 2010). About 12% of European children are regularly exposed to SHS at home (Carreras et al., 2020), and socially disadvantaged children and adolescents are also more likely to be exposed to SHS at home (59%) than children of parents with high socioeconomic status (21%) (Kuntz and Lampert, 2016). In children, SHS is estimated to cause up to 13% of all new cases of asthma, 20% of lower respiratory infections, 15% of cases of otitis media, and over 20% of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Öberg et al., 2010, 2011; Hänninen et al., 2011; Carreras et al., 2019, 2020; GBD Collaborative Network, 2020). The exposure of children to toxic chemicals in Europe, mould, SHS, and poor indoor air quality are the subject of current work at the EEA, to be released in forthcoming publications. Additional information on indoor air quality is available as part of the EEA’s   and the WHO guidelines for indoor air quality concerning  ,  , and  .   Good progress has been made towards reducing air pollution from industry, transport, and homes — thereby reducing the number of deaths of all ages linked to air pollution as a result. In the EU-27, total emissions of all pollutants have consistently declined from 2005 to 2020 (the latest year with validated data). Figure 3 shows the trend in total emissions of particularly harmful air pollutants, indexed as a percentage of their value in the reference year 2005. Though the decline of all pollutants is good news, the decline of particulate matter, both PM  and PM , is of special importance, given their overall impact on the health of Europeans.   : EEA (2022b) . These facts were already highlighted by the EEA and WHO Europe 20 years ago (EEA and WHO Europe et al., 2003) and are still true today. Policies and interventions targeting air pollutants can be categorised according to whether they aim at reducing emissions (prevention), reducing concentrations (mitigation) or avoiding individual exposure (avoidance) (Public Health England, 2019). There are entire catalogues of existing and proposed policies and interventions within these categories (Burns et al., 2020), including those mentioned in this briefing. To ensure that air pollution policies and interventions adequately protect children and adolescents, it is important that they explicitly acknowledge and integrate the different exposures and biology of these groups, rather than treating them implicitly as little adults. Ideally, air pollution decisions and policies should be informed by specific risk assessments to children’s health, while also setting out a clear framework to protect children and adolescents from polluted air at the places and settings where they are most at risk, including prenatally. Involving the groups and institutions involved in childcare, education and health, as well as encouraging the engagement of parents and/or caregivers can promote buy-in and foster success. Reducing the concentration of air pollutants will help protect all Europeans, including children. However, until air pollution is reduced to safer levels, preventing exposure is the most effective way of protecting children’s health. Ultimately, all air pollution policies designed to reduce exposure ought to be implemented down to local levels of government, where the exposures actually occur. The examples of good practices listed in this briefing are only a subset of possible policies, focused mostly on avoidance (i.e. reducing exposure to air pollution). They are highlighted because they are highly local and actionable, and they focus on an easily identifiable context where children are exposed to air pollution: within care and educational settings. Locally, where exposures occur, certain good practices can be considered to reduce exposures in children. Frequently, these good practices focus on the different microenvironments where children spend most of their time: home, schools/kindergartens (including school gates, drop-off zones, classrooms and playgrounds), indoor and outdoor activities which are neither at home nor at school, and transport including school commutes. Air pollution concentrations in school grounds, playgrounds and drop-off points are heavily influenced by proximity to nearby roads, traffic density and traffic flow (Rivas et al., 2018; Boniardi et al., 2021; Osborne et al., 2021). For example, in a recent study the concentration of PM  was found to intensify by approximately a factor of three at the school entrance during drop-off hours, as cars queued (Kumar et al., 2020). Reducing ambient air pollution around schools can contribute significantly to reducing the dose of air pollutants inhaled by schoolchildren daily. This reduction can be achieved in various ways. . Establishing ‘clean air zones’ around schools can reduce the concentration of pollutants found around them. Lower pollution levels can be achieved through restrictions on traffic, such as no-idling zones around schools (Ryan et al., 2013; Rumchev et al., 2021; Mendoza et al., 2022), ‘school streets’ (i.e. with a traffic ban at the start and end of the school day in the immediate vicinity of the school), or relocation of drop off/pick-up points away from school entrances (Davis, 2020; Den Hond et al., 2020; Koppen et al., 2020; van Poppel et al. 2020 Huertas-Delgado et al., 2022). . If a school is still in the planning stage, children’s exposure to air pollution can be reduced by placing the school away from pollution sources or hotspots of high air pollution, as already mandated in various European countries (NICE, 2017; Rijkswaterstaat Environment, 2022; Senatsverwaltung für Umwelt, Mobilität, Verbraucher- und Klimaschutz, 2022). This principle should be applied cautiously, however, as the location of a school influences the primary modes of travel to and from it (An et al., 2021). A school built at a site with better air quality might be further away from housing areas, thus requiring a commute by motorised transport which could in turn lead to higher exposure levels at the school. A school located closer to the children’s housing, meanwhile, may be reachable on foot or by bike, reducing traffic and leading to better air quality in the vicinity. Commuting modes and routes are another area of action where good practices can reduce exposure. For example, when the same home-school route is taken by children walking and commuting by car, the pedestrians experience a higher dose of pollutants. However, by taking an alternative background route or avoiding proximity to traffic queues, pedestrians can lower their dose. In fact, studies show that pedestrians may be willing to change their route when presented with pollution information (Dirks et al., 2016; de Nazelle et al., 2017; Rafiepourgatabi et al., 2021; Wolfe et al., 2021), switching to alternative routes with less exposure (‘background routes’). More children walking to school also reduces motorised traffic and the resulting pollution from private vehicles. Placing schools away from high-volume roads and within a walkable distance from home can benefit children’s health via a lower exposure to air pollution (An et al., 2021), particularly when background routes are used. It can also benefit children’s health through increased physical activity (Chillón et al., 2015) — an important consideration given that in most situations the benefits of physical activity outweigh the risks of air pollution (Tainio et al., 2021). Ultimately however, economic, social, and other considerations may preclude altering the siting of schools or changing commuting modes. . The design of school and childcare facilities can contribute to minimising the exposure of children to air pollution while onsite. This may entail locating the most frequented rooms or areas as far away from road traffic as possible, shielding the playground behind buildings, walls or green infrastructure (i.e. using plants), and allowing natural ventilation patterns that promote pollutant dispersion (An et al., 2021). At the same time, care must be taken to avoid unfiltered ventilation when there are high pollution levels outdoors near the school. Green infrastructure can filter some air pollutants and alter the airflow — thus changing pollution concentrations in local microenvironments (Abhijith et al., 2017). The type, height and porosity of vegetation heavily influences this cleaning effect, but various solutions from ivy screens to hedge fences have proved effective locally (Tremper et al., 2015: Tremper and Green, 2018; Tomson et al., 2021; Redondo-Bermúdez et al., 2022). Beyond their air quality enhancing effect, green infrastructure in and around schools provides multiple social and environmental co-benefits, including cooling, sun protection, opportunities for physical activity, water storage, habitat conservation, etc. (Redondo-Bermúdez et al., 2022). Nevertheless, the level of greening around schools in urban areas in Europe is low. On average, just over 10% of the area within a 300m radius of educational facilities is green, and only 6% is covered by trees (EEA, 2023). Schools with the greenest surroundings tend to be in northern Europe (Figure 4).  EEA (2023) . Children spend many hours indoors at school and kindergartens, so measures to reduce indoor air pollution in those spaces are crucial to reduce their overall exposure. Reducing toxic chemicals and mould is crucial for good indoor air quality in schools. Establishing regulations to improve indoor air quality and limit values for common air pollutants in places where sensitive populations gather is a crucial start (Vlaamse Regering, 2004; Lowther et al., 2021; UBA, 2023; Gouvernement de France, 2022). Clear sources of exposure to indoor air pollutants such as cleaning, painting, etc. should be organised to minimise children’s exposure, by scheduling them to take place after school hours, using low-emission cleaning products and materials, prioritising wet cleaning, fitting vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters, minimising the use of toxic chemicals, and using technologies like sorptive boards (surfaces engineered to trap certain pollutants) and CO  monitoring in classrooms as an indicator of indoor air quality. In most school settings, outdoor air quality can be better than indoor air quality on several parameters, and ventilation is a prime tool to improve indoor air quality in classrooms and laboratories. It lowers CO  levels and the risk of aerosol-transmitted diseases, removes moisture (and associated mould risks — see below), as well as odours and toxic chemicals from construction products, furniture and cleaning agents (Fisk, 2017; Aguilar et al., 2022). Ventilation of buildings can be improved by: (1) opening windows and doors to bring in ambient air, (2) using heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) devices, and ensuring exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens are working properly, and (3) communicating necessary background knowledge and instructions to students, parents, faculty and staff (Beregszaszi et al., 2013; European Commission et al., 2014; Baldauf et al., 2015; Jhun et al., 2017; Rivas et al., 2018; Thevenet et al., 2018; Brand et al., 2019; WHO Europe, 2022). Mould only grows when there is sufficient moisture, so detecting sources of moisture is the first step to controlling it. Leaking pipes, overflows, rain seeping through cracks or gaps in roofs, spills from blocked gutters, leaky window frames and rising damp are frequent causes of excess moisture, often leaving ‘tidemarks’ that should be interpreted as warning signs for mould. Another typical source of moisture is condensation, due to high humidity indoors and worsened by low temperatures and poor ventilation. Such sources of moisture should be eliminated, and any dampness removed via ventilation, dehumidifiers, etc. Thereafter, mould should be removed from affected areas. If the mould-affected area is large, or mould is present in the building structure and materials, removal should be done by qualified professionals, according to local and national standards. Finally, to stop mould and dampness from reoccurring, basic prevention measures should be undertaken including opening windows daily, using fans in bathrooms and kitchens, maintaining mechanical ventilation where installed, watching for and repairing leaks, and avoiding condensation on cold surfaces (WHO Europe, 2009; WHO, 2022).  . The reduction of smoking in all its forms, especially in child-centric settings such as in and around schools and kindergartens, is of key importance to reduce children’s overall exposure to SHS, despite the fact that it can also occur at home, in vehicles and elsewhere. Exposure to SHS has been observed to be significantly reduced by implementing smoking bans in all public places (Liang et al., 2016; El Sharkawy et al., 2021; Laverty et al., 2021; Nogueira et al., 2022). A recent study in Germany (Burkhardt et al., 2023) measured an 82% decline in a biomarker of tobacco smoke in the urine of non-smokers from 1995 to 2019, and largely attributes this to smoking bans and regulations limiting SHS following European legislation. Bans can benefit children when implemented with a special emphasis and consistent enforcement in and around schools and kindergartens. Interventions establishing family rules for smoke free vehicles (e.g. when commuting to school), smoking counselling to parents or caregivers, strict enforcement of complete tobacco bans in and around schools, and awareness campaigns against SHS have all shown to work in reducing children’s exposure to SHS (Blaakman et al., 2013; Bunik et al., 2013; Sharifi et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2015, 2020; Hoehn et al., 2016; Mason et al., 2016; Caldwell et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2018; Turner et al., 2020). More evidence on SHS impacts on children and good practices to reduce exposure will be published in forthcoming EEA products.  In addition to the good practices considered above, there is a wide range of local measures that can help protect the general population against air pollution. Well-informed residents are generally in a better position to demand action on air pollution and protect themselves from it. Two key EEA products can help citizens understand more about the air quality where they live. The European Environment Agency’s   gives near-real time assessments of air quality for more than 3,500 air quality monitoring stations across Europe. The   allows citizens to check how the air quality was in their city over the past 2 years and to compare it with air quality in other cities across Europe. While reducing European children’s and adolescents’ exposure to air pollution is crucial and urgent, the surest way to keep them safe in the long term is by making the air we all breathe cleaner. The EU bases its clean air policy on three main pillars: (1) the   (EU, 2016); (2) source-specific legislation for key sources of air pollution (European Commission, 2022a); and (3) the Ambient Air Quality Directives (EU, 2004, 2008), which set air quality standards (EEA, 2021). In October 2022, the European Commission published a  , including the following key measures (EEA, 2022a): The above measures are aligned with other legislative proposals, such as the revision of the   and recent proposals on   for road vehicles, which will support the achievement of stricter air quality standards. They are key to achieving one of the goals of the zero pollution action plan: reducing by 2030 the number of premature deaths caused by exposure to PM  by at least 55% compared with 2005 levels (European Commission, 2022b). In the international context, the EU Member States work closely with other UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) member countries to control international air pollution under the UNECE  .  It should be noted that achieving the goals and air pollution levels set forth by current EU policies and regulation will still not mean that the air in Europe is safe for children and adolescents. For example, there is no evidence of a safe level or a threshold of exposure to PM below which no adverse health effects occur, and in the past research has tended to detect health impacts of air pollution at progressively lower levels. This notwithstanding, air in Europe which is cleaner overall will significantly contribute to making our children and adolescents healthier.           Abhijith, K.

Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it! All official European Union website addresses are in the   domain. Briefing Protecting children’s health is frequently cited as a key objective in major policies on climate and the environment such as the zero pollution action plan (European Commission, 2020). Though most children across EEA member countries are healthy (Eurostat, 2019; WHO, 2023), there are reasons for concern regarding environmental risks to their health. Children and adolescents are more susceptible than adults to most adverse environmental factors; in some cases they may be more exposed than adults too (Valent et al., 2004); and they can do little to change the situation or protect themselves. That is especially true for air pollution, the largest environmental risk for children in Europe. There are many factors that make children and adolescents especially vulnerable to air pollution. Children’s breathing rates are higher than those of adults and they also take in more air per kilogram of body weight. Because of their lower physical height, they breathe air closer to the ground where some pollutants, especially from traffic exhausts, are emitted and become concentrated. Their acquired dose of pollution is also elevated since they breathe faster and are often more physically active (Osborne et al., 2021). Moreover, children inhale a larger fraction of air through their mouths than adults. Due to this increased oral breathing, pollution penetrates deep into the lower respiratory tract, which is more permeable (US EPA, 2019). Children’s bodies and organs, including their lungs, are also still in development (Chen et al., 2015), which further increases risk. Furthermore, children’s developing immune systems are weaker than those of adults, strengthening the effects of pollution (WHO, 2018).    Air pollution is the contamination of indoor or outdoor air by any agent that modifies its natural characteristics. It comes from both natural and, particularly, man-made sources, which include everything from road traffic and residential heating exhausts, through to factory chimney stacks and a wide variety of other sources (EEA, 2022a, 2022c). Air pollution affects urban and rural areas, and comes in many forms, from ambient air particles, ozone and nitrogen oxides, to second-hand smoke (SHS), smoke from the burning of biomass in households, mould spores, mites and allergens, and toxic chemicals like formaldehyde (Trasande et al., 2016; Carreras et al., 2019; Rojas-Rueda et al., 2019; WHO, 2022). Some of the aforementioned pollutants and sources are more frequent or found at higher concentrations indoors. They are the subject of ongoing research at the EEA and findings will be summarised in forthcoming publications. Boxes 1 and 2 in this briefing provide some highlights on indoor air pollutants. This briefing however focuses on outdoor ambient air pollution, a term that is used interchangeably with ‘air pollution’ hereafter. Depending on the pollutant, different sources of ambient air pollution are the main drivers of exposure, as illustrated in Figure 2 below (EEA, 2022b). : EEA (2022a) . NMVOC: non-methane volatile organic compounds; NO : nitrogen oxides; PM : particles with a diameter smaller than 2,5 microns; PM : particles with a diameter smaller than 10 microns; SO : sulphur dioxide. Children’s and adolescents’ exposure to air pollutants partly mimics that of adults, but it also differs in specific ways. Children are already exposed to air pollution while in their mothers’ wombs, and after birth they are typically exposed to air pollution in child-centric settings such as: outside in the grounds of schools and kindergartens; in classrooms where ambient air pollution worsens indoor air quality; and during activities like commuting to school and afterschool activities. Smaller children are also exposed to air pollution closer to the ground, where the concentrations of some pollutants are higher. Children and adolescents tend to spend more time outdoors and are more physically active than adults, potentially increasing their exposure to ambient air pollution. In addition, as is the case with other environmental risks, poorer children tend to be systematically more exposed to and affected by air pollution (Fairburn et al., 2019) than their better-off counterparts.   Children are affected by ambient air pollutants from the womb through to adulthood. Every year in EEA member and collaborating countries, air pollution is estimated to cause over 1,200 deaths and the loss of over 110,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs, a measure of the burden of disease caused by a risk factor) among those aged under 18 (GBD Collaborative Network, 2020). These deaths, along with a significant burden from non-fatal diseases, are caused by air pollution through a variety of mechanisms and health outcomes, which are explored below. Before birth, ambient air pollution increases the risk of babies being smaller during pregnancy (a condition known as ‘small for gestational age’, or SGA) (Pun et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Nyadanu et al., 2022), having a low birth weight (Yang et al., 2020; Ghosh et al., 2021) as well as having an increased risk of pre-term birth (US EPA, 2020; Nyadanu et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022). All of these can increase the risk of different health problems later in life. Though the evidence is less clear, particulate matter has also been linked to an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and still births (Grippo et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2022). Despite solid epidemiological data, the biological mechanisms are not fully understood for most of the pre-natal risks of air pollution. After birth, ambient air pollution increases the risk of several types of adverse health outcomes for children and adolescents. For example, it increases the risk of respiratory infections in children, including acute lower respiratory infections, pneumonia, upper respiratory infections and otitis media (ear infections) (Mehta et al., 2013; Nhung et al., 2017; Bowatte et al., 2018; King et al., 2018; Låg et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Ziou et al., 2022). Short-term exposure to air pollution may also exacerbate allergies, including allergic rhinitis (runny nose), eczema and conjunctivitis (itchy eyes) in children (US EPA, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020). Children’s lung function and lung development are also affected by ambient air pollution, especially by ozone and nitrogen dioxide (NO ) in the short term, and by fine particles (PM ) in the long term. This effect can be seen both in healthy children and also in children with asthma, which can be exacerbated by pollution (US EPA, 2010, 2017, 2019, 2020; WHO, 2018, 2021a; Garcia et al., 2021; Holm and Balmes, 2022). Asthma affects over 9% of children in the EU (Selroos et al., 2015), placing a large burden on children, their families and societies. The risk of developing asthma itself and asthma-like symptoms is clearly linked to long-term exposure to air pollution (US EPA, 2010, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020; Zu et al., 2018; Låg et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Bettiol et al., 2021; Han et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022). This has been observed both in epidemiological studies and in the laboratory, where the mechanisms for this effect have been studied and confirmed. Asthma symptoms can range from mild to very severe, even life-threatening. Exposure to short term increases in air pollution increases the risk of asthma hospitalisation and emergency department visits for children (Mustafić et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2016; US EPA, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022). Ambient air pollution may also be linked to other types of health problems in children. For example, there is growing evidence that air pollution affects children’s brain development, contributes to cognitive impairment, and that it may play a role in the development of some types of Autistic Spectrum Disorders (US EPA, 2015, 2019, 2020; Dutheil et al., 2021; Health Effects Institute, 2022; Lin et al., 2022). Some studies have also observed a link between traffic-related air pollution, with benzene playing a key role, and leukaemia in children (Orsini et al., 2012; Filippini et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021).   In addition to ambient air pollution from traffic, heating, industry, etc., children’s health is also threatened by other airborne pollutants, like second-hand smoke and chemicals. Children can be exposed to these pollutants both outdoors and indoors.  Indoor air pollution (IAP): European children spend most of their time indoors, and indoor air pollution can significantly affect their health and well-being. Sources of IAP include: some building products and furnishings that release toxic chemicals; materials like some mineral fibres and legacy-asbestos still remaining in buildings; natural pollutants like radioactive radon. Outdoor air pollution also contributes to indoor air pollution, as does smoking, burning candles, allergens and dust, among others. Two types of air pollutants are of particular importance indoors: mould, and several types of toxic chemicals. Mould is a frequent indoor health hazard for adults and children alike, for whom it increases the risk of developing asthma, asthma exacerbation, wheeze, allergic rhinitis, and respiratory infections (Gern et al., 1999; Dick et al., 2014; Tham et al., 2014; Kanchongkittiphon et al., 2015; Sharpe et al., 2015; Hurraß et al., 2017; Fakunle et al., 2020, 2021). The concentrations of certain chemicals that are toxic for adults and children, such as formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds (VOC), flame retardants, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) tend to be much higher in indoor air. However, our knowledge of the sources, concentrations, status of, and trends in indoor air pollution in Europe lags far behind that of outdoor air pollution. Second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS): there is no safe level of SHS exposure, and children are particularly vulnerable to it both before and after birth (Öberg et al., 2010). About 12% of European children are regularly exposed to SHS at home (Carreras et al., 2020), and socially disadvantaged children and adolescents are also more likely to be exposed to SHS at home (59%) than children of parents with high socioeconomic status (21%) (Kuntz and Lampert, 2016). In children, SHS is estimated to cause up to 13% of all new cases of asthma, 20% of lower respiratory infections, 15% of cases of otitis media, and over 20% of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Öberg et al., 2010, 2011; Hänninen et al., 2011; Carreras et al., 2019, 2020; GBD Collaborative Network, 2020). The exposure of children to toxic chemicals in Europe, mould, SHS, and poor indoor air quality are the subject of current work at the EEA, to be released in forthcoming publications. Additional information on indoor air quality is available as part of the EEA’s   and the WHO guidelines for indoor air quality concerning  ,  , and  .   Good progress has been made towards reducing air pollution from industry, transport, and homes — thereby reducing the number of deaths of all ages linked to air pollution as a result. In the EU-27, total emissions of all pollutants have consistently declined from 2005 to 2020 (the latest year with validated data). Figure 3 shows the trend in total emissions of particularly harmful air pollutants, indexed as a percentage of their value in the reference year 2005. Though the decline of all pollutants is good news, the decline of particulate matter, both PM  and PM , is of special importance, given their overall impact on the health of Europeans.   : EEA (2022b) . These facts were already highlighted by the EEA and WHO Europe 20 years ago (EEA and WHO Europe et al., 2003) and are still true today. Policies and interventions targeting air pollutants can be categorised according to whether they aim at reducing emissions (prevention), reducing concentrations (mitigation) or avoiding individual exposure (avoidance) (Public Health England, 2019). There are entire catalogues of existing and proposed policies and interventions within these categories (Burns et al., 2020), including those mentioned in this briefing. To ensure that air pollution policies and interventions adequately protect children and adolescents, it is important that they explicitly acknowledge and integrate the different exposures and biology of these groups, rather than treating them implicitly as little adults. Ideally, air pollution decisions and policies should be informed by specific risk assessments to children’s health, while also setting out a clear framework to protect children and adolescents from polluted air at the places and settings where they are most at risk, including prenatally. Involving the groups and institutions involved in childcare, education and health, as well as encouraging the engagement of parents and/or caregivers can promote buy-in and foster success. Reducing the concentration of air pollutants will help protect all Europeans, including children. However, until air pollution is reduced to safer levels, preventing exposure is the most effective way of protecting children’s health. Ultimately, all air pollution policies designed to reduce exposure ought to be implemented down to local levels of government, where the exposures actually occur. The examples of good practices listed in this briefing are only a subset of possible policies, focused mostly on avoidance (i.e. reducing exposure to air pollution). They are highlighted because they are highly local and actionable, and they focus on an easily identifiable context where children are exposed to air pollution: within care and educational settings. Locally, where exposures occur, certain good practices can be considered to reduce exposures in children. Frequently, these good practices focus on the different microenvironments where children spend most of their time: home, schools/kindergartens (including school gates, drop-off zones, classrooms and playgrounds), indoor and outdoor activities which are neither at home nor at school, and transport including school commutes. Air pollution concentrations in school grounds, playgrounds and drop-off points are heavily influenced by proximity to nearby roads, traffic density and traffic flow (Rivas et al., 2018; Boniardi et al., 2021; Osborne et al., 2021). For example, in a recent study the concentration of PM  was found to intensify by approximately a factor of three at the school entrance during drop-off hours, as cars queued (Kumar et al., 2020). Reducing ambient air pollution around schools can contribute significantly to reducing the dose of air pollutants inhaled by schoolchildren daily. This reduction can be achieved in various ways. . Establishing ‘clean air zones’ around schools can reduce the concentration of pollutants found around them. Lower pollution levels can be achieved through restrictions on traffic, such as no-idling zones around schools (Ryan et al., 2013; Rumchev et al., 2021; Mendoza et al., 2022), ‘school streets’ (i.e. with a traffic ban at the start and end of the school day in the immediate vicinity of the school), or relocation of drop off/pick-up points away from school entrances (Davis, 2020; Den Hond et al., 2020; Koppen et al., 2020; van Poppel et al. 2020 Huertas-Delgado et al., 2022). . If a school is still in the planning stage, children’s exposure to air pollution can be reduced by placing the school away from pollution sources or hotspots of high air pollution, as already mandated in various European countries (NICE, 2017; Rijkswaterstaat Environment, 2022; Senatsverwaltung für Umwelt, Mobilität, Verbraucher- und Klimaschutz, 2022). This principle should be applied cautiously, however, as the location of a school influences the primary modes of travel to and from it (An et al., 2021). A school built at a site with better air quality might be further away from housing areas, thus requiring a commute by motorised transport which could in turn lead to higher exposure levels at the school. A school located closer to the children’s housing, meanwhile, may be reachable on foot or by bike, reducing traffic and leading to better air quality in the vicinity. Commuting modes and routes are another area of action where good practices can reduce exposure. For example, when the same home-school route is taken by children walking and commuting by car, the pedestrians experience a higher dose of pollutants. However, by taking an alternative background route or avoiding proximity to traffic queues, pedestrians can lower their dose. In fact, studies show that pedestrians may be willing to change their route when presented with pollution information (Dirks et al., 2016; de Nazelle et al., 2017; Rafiepourgatabi et al., 2021; Wolfe et al., 2021), switching to alternative routes with less exposure (‘background routes’). More children walking to school also reduces motorised traffic and the resulting pollution from private vehicles. Placing schools away from high-volume roads and within a walkable distance from home can benefit children’s health via a lower exposure to air pollution (An et al., 2021), particularly when background routes are used. It can also benefit children’s health through increased physical activity (Chillón et al., 2015) — an important consideration given that in most situations the benefits of physical activity outweigh the risks of air pollution (Tainio et al., 2021). Ultimately however, economic, social, and other considerations may preclude altering the siting of schools or changing commuting modes. . The design of school and childcare facilities can contribute to minimising the exposure of children to air pollution while onsite. This may entail locating the most frequented rooms or areas as far away from road traffic as possible, shielding the playground behind buildings, walls or green infrastructure (i.e. using plants), and allowing natural ventilation patterns that promote pollutant dispersion (An et al., 2021). At the same time, care must be taken to avoid unfiltered ventilation when there are high pollution levels outdoors near the school. Green infrastructure can filter some air pollutants and alter the airflow — thus changing pollution concentrations in local microenvironments (Abhijith et al., 2017). The type, height and porosity of vegetation heavily influences this cleaning effect, but various solutions from ivy screens to hedge fences have proved effective locally (Tremper et al., 2015: Tremper and Green, 2018; Tomson et al., 2021; Redondo-Bermúdez et al., 2022). Beyond their air quality enhancing effect, green infrastructure in and around schools provides multiple social and environmental co-benefits, including cooling, sun protection, opportunities for physical activity, water storage, habitat conservation, etc. (Redondo-Bermúdez et al., 2022). Nevertheless, the level of greening around schools in urban areas in Europe is low. On average, just over 10% of the area within a 300m radius of educational facilities is green, and only 6% is covered by trees (EEA, 2023). Schools with the greenest surroundings tend to be in northern Europe (Figure 4).  EEA (2023) . Children spend many hours indoors at school and kindergartens, so measures to reduce indoor air pollution in those spaces are crucial to reduce their overall exposure. Reducing toxic chemicals and mould is crucial for good indoor air quality in schools. Establishing regulations to improve indoor air quality and limit values for common air pollutants in places where sensitive populations gather is a crucial start (Vlaamse Regering, 2004; Lowther et al., 2021; UBA, 2023; Gouvernement de France, 2022). Clear sources of exposure to indoor air pollutants such as cleaning, painting, etc. should be organised to minimise children’s exposure, by scheduling them to take place after school hours, using low-emission cleaning products and materials, prioritising wet cleaning, fitting vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters, minimising the use of toxic chemicals, and using technologies like sorptive boards (surfaces engineered to trap certain pollutants) and CO  monitoring in classrooms as an indicator of indoor air quality. In most school settings, outdoor air quality can be better than indoor air quality on several parameters, and ventilation is a prime tool to improve indoor air quality in classrooms and laboratories. It lowers CO  levels and the risk of aerosol-transmitted diseases, removes moisture (and associated mould risks — see below), as well as odours and toxic chemicals from construction products, furniture and cleaning agents (Fisk, 2017; Aguilar et al., 2022). Ventilation of buildings can be improved by: (1) opening windows and doors to bring in ambient air, (2) using heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) devices, and ensuring exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens are working properly, and (3) communicating necessary background knowledge and instructions to students, parents, faculty and staff (Beregszaszi et al., 2013; European Commission et al., 2014; Baldauf et al., 2015; Jhun et al., 2017; Rivas et al., 2018; Thevenet et al., 2018; Brand et al., 2019; WHO Europe, 2022). Mould only grows when there is sufficient moisture, so detecting sources of moisture is the first step to controlling it. Leaking pipes, overflows, rain seeping through cracks or gaps in roofs, spills from blocked gutters, leaky window frames and rising damp are frequent causes of excess moisture, often leaving ‘tidemarks’ that should be interpreted as warning signs for mould. Another typical source of moisture is condensation, due to high humidity indoors and worsened by low temperatures and poor ventilation. Such sources of moisture should be eliminated, and any dampness removed via ventilation, dehumidifiers, etc. Thereafter, mould should be removed from affected areas. If the mould-affected area is large, or mould is present in the building structure and materials, removal should be done by qualified professionals, according to local and national standards. Finally, to stop mould and dampness from reoccurring, basic prevention measures should be undertaken including opening windows daily, using fans in bathrooms and kitchens, maintaining mechanical ventilation where installed, watching for and repairing leaks, and avoiding condensation on cold surfaces (WHO Europe, 2009; WHO, 2022).  . The reduction of smoking in all its forms, especially in child-centric settings such as in and around schools and kindergartens, is of key importance to reduce children’s overall exposure to SHS, despite the fact that it can also occur at home, in vehicles and elsewhere. Exposure to SHS has been observed to be significantly reduced by implementing smoking bans in all public places (Liang et al., 2016; El Sharkawy et al., 2021; Laverty et al., 2021; Nogueira et al., 2022). A recent study in Germany (Burkhardt et al., 2023) measured an 82% decline in a biomarker of tobacco smoke in the urine of non-smokers from 1995 to 2019, and largely attributes this to smoking bans and regulations limiting SHS following European legislation. Bans can benefit children when implemented with a special emphasis and consistent enforcement in and around schools and kindergartens. Interventions establishing family rules for smoke free vehicles (e.g. when commuting to school), smoking counselling to parents or caregivers, strict enforcement of complete tobacco bans in and around schools, and awareness campaigns against SHS have all shown to work in reducing children’s exposure to SHS (Blaakman et al., 2013; Bunik et al., 2013; Sharifi et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2015, 2020; Hoehn et al., 2016; Mason et al., 2016; Caldwell et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2018; Turner et al., 2020). More evidence on SHS impacts on children and good practices to reduce exposure will be published in forthcoming EEA products.  In addition to the good practices considered above, there is a wide range of local measures that can help protect the general population against air pollution. Well-informed residents are generally in a better position to demand action on air pollution and protect themselves from it. Two key EEA products can help citizens understand more about the air quality where they live. The European Environment Agency’s   gives near-real time assessments of air quality for more than 3,500 air quality monitoring stations across Europe. The   allows citizens to check how the air quality was in their city over the past 2 years and to compare it with air quality in other cities across Europe. While reducing European children’s and adolescents’ exposure to air pollution is crucial and urgent, the surest way to keep them safe in the long term is by making the air we all breathe cleaner. The EU bases its clean air policy on three main pillars: (1) the   (EU, 2016); (2) source-specific legislation for key sources of air pollution (European Commission, 2022a); and (3) the Ambient Air Quality Directives (EU, 2004, 2008), which set air quality standards (EEA, 2021). In October 2022, the European Commission published a  , including the following key measures (EEA, 2022a): The above measures are aligned with other legislative proposals, such as the revision of the   and recent proposals on   for road vehicles, which will support the achievement of stricter air quality standards. They are key to achieving one of the goals of the zero pollution action plan: reducing by 2030 the number of premature deaths caused by exposure to PM  by at least 55% compared with 2005 levels (European Commission, 2022b). In the international context, the EU Member States work closely with other UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) member countries to control international air pollution under the UNECE  .  It should be noted that achieving the goals and air pollution levels set forth by current EU policies and regulation will still not mean that the air in Europe is safe for children and adolescents. For example, there is no evidence of a safe level or a threshold of exposure to PM below which no adverse health effects occur, and in the past research has tended to detect health impacts of air pollution at progressively lower levels. This notwithstanding, air in Europe which is cleaner overall will significantly contribute to making our children and adolescents healthier.           Abhijith, K.

Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe and a major cause of premature death and disease. Latest estimates by the European Environment Agency (EEA) show that fine particulate matter (PM ) continues to cause the most substantial health impacts. Most Europeans live in areas, especially cities, where air pollution can reach high levels. Both short- and long-term exposure to air pollution can lead to a wide range of diseases, including stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trachea, bronchus and lung cancers, aggravated asthma and lower respiratory infections. The   (WHO) provides evidence of links between exposure to air pollution and type 2 diabetes, obesity, systemic inflammation, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. The   has classified air pollution, in particular PM , as a leading cause of cancer. A recent   found that  , complicating and exacerbating existing health conditions. Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable because their bodies, organs and immune systems are still developing. Air pollution  and increases the risk of diseases later in life, yet children can do little to protect themselves or influence air quality policies.  is the air pollutant driving the most significant health problems and premature mortality. In 2021,   was exposed to concentrations of fine particulate matter above the health-based guideline level set by the World Health Organization. 238,000 premature deaths  due to fine particulate matter above WHO-guideline level The  , in 2020, approximately 238,000 premature deaths were attributable to PM  in the 27 EU Member States. In 2020, premature deaths attributed to exposure to fine particulate matter fell by 45% in the EU-27, compared to 2005. \r Residential, commercial and institutional energy consumption was the principal source of particulate matter in 2020. The manufacturing and extractive industry was also a significant source, while agriculture was an equally important source of PM . Between 2005 and 2020, emissions of particulate matter, PM  and PM , fell by 30% and 32%, respectively.\r In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) published   following a systematic review of the latest scientific evidence demonstrating how air pollution damages human health. The European Union (EU) has also set   in the  . In the  , the European Commission committed to further improving air quality and to aligning EU air quality standards more closely with the WHO recommendations. This commitment was echoed in the  , which set a vision for 2050 to reduce air, water and soil pollution to levels no longer considered harmful to health and natural ecosystems. In addition, the zero pollution action plan introduced targets for 2030, two of which focus on air and aim to:\r \r \r Stricter air quality standards would also contribute to the objectives of  . Air pollution is a known cause of cancer in Europe; in particular, lung cancer ( ).\r In terms of the past trend, from 2005 to 2020, premature deaths attributed to PM  exposure in the EU-27 fell by 33% to reach 238,000. Should air quality continue to improve, and the number of premature deaths per year continue to fall at a comparable rate in the future, then the zero pollution target would be achieved by 2032, as shown in the figure below.\r \r \r \r \r In October 2022, the European Commission published  . Key measures are listed below.\r \r The above measures are aligned with other legislative proposals, such as the revision of the   and recent proposals on the   for road vehicles, which will support the achievement of stricter air quality standards. \r Air pollution affects people in different ways.  . In addition, the most deprived people in society often have poorer health and less access to high-quality medical care, increasing their vulnerability. \r There is strong evidence linking lower socio-economic status to increased exposure to air pollution. In large parts of Europe,   and thus, face higher levels of exposure to air pollution. At the same time, exposure patterns vary across European cities. In some cities, wealthier people live in central, polluted areas, while in other European cities central areas are inhabited by poorer communities. \r In Europe,   and tend to occur in Eastern and South-eastern Europe. This pattern is largely driven by the combustion of low-quality solid fuels (e.g. coal and wood) in low-efficiency ovens for domestic heating in those areas. The higher population exposure to PM  in particular regions, translates into higher numbers of premature deaths attributed to air pollution.  \r Besides premature death, air pollution also causes morbidity. People live with diseases related to exposure to air pollution; this is a burden in terms of personal suffering as well as significant costs on the healthcare sector. In 2019, exposure to PM  led to 175,702 years lived with disability (YLDs) due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 30 European countries. At the same time, exposure to NO2 led to 175,070 YLDs due to diabetes mellitus (also known as Type 2 diabetes) in 31 European countries. That same year, 12,253 people across 23 European countries were admitted to the hospital with lower respiratory infections resulting from acute exposure to ozone.\r The interactive map viewer shows the spatial distribution of population-weighted concentrations of PM  (as an indication of population exposure) across Europe and the associated mortality. The viewer also allows to display data against GDP per capita as a proxy for the average socio-economic characteristics of the population in each region. The data is presented for   (between 150,000 and 800,000 inhabitants). \r"},

Twenty-five years later, the 28 Member States of the EU have reduced their emissions by more than 22 % below 1990 levels  and reported information concerning more than 1 500 national policies and measures that limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions or enhance the removal of CO  from the atmosphere  .

The quality of the information reported in 2017 improved in terms of its completeness, consistency, accuracy and transparency, compared with the reporting cycle in 2015. However, quantitative information onex postpolicy evaluations, costs and benefits, and indicators remains underreported. In 2017, only nine Member States (Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Poland) reported information on the emission reductions achieved, and for only 65 policies and measures (Figure 2). This does not allow for a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of existing national climate policies across the EU to be performed. It also highlights the further need for Member States to increase their efforts to assess the effects of their implemented policies more systematically. There can be technical explanations for the low level of quantitative information reported. For example, Member States do not use common evaluation approaches and methodologies, and may use different assumptions or find it difficult to separate the effects of individual policies from others. There may also be political reasons for this. Some policy makers may prefer to focus on new proposals and are often not very interested in communicating the actual effects of past actions. Comparing and summingex postemission savings therefore becomes a highly uncertain exercise. Detailed and transparent information on national policies and measures is essential to track climate action at national and EU levels. Additionally, policy evaluation plays a crucial role in policy processes, for example, by allowing policy makers to assess the contribution of specific policies to the achievement of climate mitigation objectives, and to understand success factors and obstacles to policy implementation. Further efforts on reporting and evaluation activities, even if incremental, are considered important to help improve the quality of the information reported under the EU monitoring mechanism and to support climate policy. On the Member States’ side, there have been recent quality improvements in the consistency, comparability, completeness and transparency of the information —particularly qualitative information – reported on national policies and measures. Efforts on quantitative aspects must, nevertheless, be further enhanced, notably onex postpolicy evaluation results, costs and benefits, and monitoring indicators.

Between 2004 and 2022, emissions from large combustion plants in the EU decreased: sulphur dioxide (SO ) and dust by 92%, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 70%. Declines in emissions and improvements in environmental performance were largely driven by European policy, which sets legally binding emission limit values. Fossil fuel useage decreased by 35% as energy production shifts to climate-friendly sources, even if coal has returned as the most used fuel in large combustion plants in Europe. Stricter emission limit values and policies aimed at increasing the use of renewable or cleaner fuels are expected to drive further declines in combustion plant emissions in coming years. As of 2022, large combustion plants (LCPs) are responsible for almost 40% of the EU’s electricity production capacity. These largely depend on fossil fuels, resulting in the emission of pollutants to air, water and land, causing damaging our ecosystems. To mitigate the environmental impact,   LCP emissions.  Emissions from LCPs decreased significantly during 2004-2022: SO  and dust by 92% and NO  by 70% . This decreased highlighted  ; 1) over the period 2007-2009, LCP operators had the double effect of needing to adapt their plants to new emission limit values from the   and the financial crisis that started at the end of 2008, and 2) around 2015-2016 coincided with the moment operators had to comply with stricter limits set by the  , which entered into full force. LCPs vary significantly in size, from 50MWt to even larger than 2,000MWt. Declines in emissions correspond to a   in environmental performance across all LCP sizes, particularly among the very large ones, which, although including only 21% of LCPs, accounts for 70% of installed capacity. These reductions demonstrate the value of European policy in driving improvements in the environmental performance of LCPs, with LCP operators adopting pollution reduction measures, more efficient operating processes and end-of-pipe pollution abatement techniques . In 2022, 3,139 LCPs, were covered by the scope of the IED. European countries rely to different degrees on combustion plants to meet their  . However, generally, the number of plants in a given country is proportional to its size and population. Czechia, Malta and Slovakia did not report 2022 data, and therefore the number of plants in Europe is estimated to be 4,047, taking into account the latest number from these four countries.    The   plays a key role in emission generation, with coal and liquid fuels substantially dirtier than other options. Shifting from fossil fuels to other energy carriers and sources is paramount to achieve climate mitigation goals. Changes to the fuel mix contributed to emission reductions over the period with other factors, including changes to a broader economy and society, international fuel prices and industry initiatives.  The war in Ukraine impacted natural gas prices in 2022. Coal was the major fuel input, surpassing natural gas for the first time since 2019. Future data will show if this may be a slowdown of the phase-out from coal progression. Natural gas and coal combined, two fossil fuels, are still very significant in the overall mix covering almost 75% of the total fuel input (Figure 2) of the combustion sector. More   are expected in the coming years as a result of stricter IED permits, and energy and climate change mitigation policies, driving the use of renewable or cleaner fuels aimed at achieving the EU’s ambition of becoming climate neutral by 2050 . Overall, LCP fuel consumption   by 35% between 2004 and 2022 (Figure 2). Largely attributed to a decrease in the consumption of fossil fuels, particularly coal (down 46% since 2010) and liquid fuels (down 36% since 2010), this mostly occurred after 2010. It could reflect a shift in Europe’s energy system from fossil fuels to renewable sources, with natural gas still playing a bridging role in this transition.  The war in Ukraine impact and rise of natural gas prices in 2022 are reflected on the overall consumption in 2022. Coal was the   covering 37% of the consumption, followed by natural gas (36%) and consumption of liquid fuel increased by 14% from 2021 levels. This pause in the coal phase-out should be monitored in the near future as it may have a negative impact on achieving the goals set by the  .  All EU countries reduced coal use over the 2004-2022 period, with five (Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and Poland) contributing for around 70% of the reduction in coal consumption (Figure 2) in 2022. However, coal still accounts for more than 50% of the fuel input in large combustion plant in four countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland and Slovenia). Another interesting phenomenon is the consistent increase of biomass as a fuel input (86% since 2010). While this has its origin in climate mitigation goals, it can result in increases of air pollution, particularly particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds . This indicator tracks trends for the so-called Large Combustion Plants' (LCPs) emissions of SO , NO  and dust, as well as the evolution of the energy mix used in these plants since 2004. LCPs comprise industrial combustion plants with a total rated thermal input equal to or greater than 50MW. The geographical coverage comprises the 27 EU Member States (EU-27) (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden). The temporal coverage is 2004-2022. Data for the period 2004-2015 were reported under Directive 2001/80/EC on large combustion plants, while for 2016 onwards they were reported under Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions. The requirements are not identical, and it is expected for data from 2016 onwards to have a slightly broader scope in terms of plants included. Queries are applied to the Industrial Emissions Database to extract and aggregate emissions reported individually for each LCP in Europe to produce Figure 1. In a similar manner, queries extract and aggregate fuel use data to produce Figure 2. Fig. 1: Emissions are indexed with reference to 2004 levels. The exact formula is: emissions of pollutant x for the current year/emissions for pollutant x in 2004) × 100. Fig. 2: Total fuel consumptions per type are summed and provided in the graph. As the data were not reported in the same way before and after 2016, the category 'coal' is the result of the sum of all solid fuels reported. Slovakia did not report any data from 2018, Malta did not report any data from 2019 and Czechia did not report data for 2022: in this cases the most recent data were used to gap-fill the trend.  No methodology references available. No rationale has been identified for this indicator.   Anthropogenic emissions of SO , NO  and dust all contribute to air quality problems in Europe. Excess deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds can lead to disturbances in the functioning and structure of ecosystems by, for example, causing the acidification of soils and waters as well as, in the case of nitrogen, the eutrophication of nutrient-poor ecosystems such as grasslands. LCPs use large amounts of fuels, mostly fossil fuels, to produce useful forms of energy. These plants inevitably generate a number of residues, waste products and emissions to all environmental media (air, water and soil). Emissions from LCPs constitute a significant proportion of total anthropogenic emissions and are considered one of the main environmental pressures from LCPs. In that context, policy has regulated these plants for decades now. Between 2004 and 2015, two pieces of EU law were in place: the LCP Directive and the IPPC Directive. This EU legislation imposed specific limit values on emissions of NO , SO  and dust from plants with a thermal rated input equal to or greater than 50MW. Since 1 January 2016, this legislation has been replaced by  . The aim of EU policy on LCPs is to reduce emissions to air, water and land, including measures related to waste, to achieve a high level of protection of the environment as a whole. The focus with regard to LCPs is to reduce emissions of acidifying pollutants, particles and ozone precursors while also covering other environmental concerns (e.g. mercury emissions). No targets have been specified. No related policy documents have been specified. This indicator covers the EU-27 countries. However, there are no data for Croatia for 2004-2009. The data for Croatia have not been gap filled, and in the years of reporting Croatia contributed less than 1% of emissions and fuel consumption to the EU-27 total. This lack of data is thus considered a minor distortion of the overall trend. As indicated, reporting requirements were not identical before and after 2016, which is also considered a minor distortion of the trend. Although reporting requirements began in 2004, it is possible that the data for the first reported period (2004-2006) contain some gaps. No uncertainty has been specified.

Briefing   This briefing  builds on the EEA’s recent  , which assesses progress towards the EU’s climate and energy targets, and a  . The findings are based   and   and   greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a   that Member States reported to the EEA in March 2019 under  . The work also relies on the results of two detailed assessments of trends in the Effort Sharing sectors carried out by the European Topic Centre (ETC) for the EEA in   and  . The EU’s Effort Sharing legislation aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the sectors that are not included in the   (EU ETS). This represents a wide range of sources, such as petrol and diesel use for road transport, energy use for heating and cooling in households and commercial buildings, animal digestion and fertiliser use in agriculture, waste treatment and small industries. Altogether, these emissions make up about 58 % of total greenhouse gas emissions at EU level. The Effort Sharing legislation does not apply to emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), which are covered by the   and from 2021 by the  . The legislation sets national annual greenhouse gas emission targets for the periods 2013-2020 ( ) and 2021-2030 ( ). These annual targets are different for each country: The national emission targets for 2020 range from a 20 % reduction by 2020 (from 2005 levels) for the richest   to a 20 % increase for the least wealthy one, Bulgaria. Taken together, the national 2020 targets represent a 10 % reduction in EU Effort Sharing emissions compared with 2005, which is in line with the EU target of a 20 % reduction in all greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (including those in the EU ETS), compared with 1990. For 2030, the national emission targets range from 0 % (no change from 2005 levels) to 40 % below 2005 levels (applicable to Effort Sharing emissions only). These targets correspond to an EU reduction of 30 % from 2005 levels by 2030, as a contribution towards the current reduction target of 40 % below 1990 levels for all greenhouse gas emissions in the EU Member States and the United Kingdom. After a 14 % decline between 2005 and 2014, followed by three consecutive annual increases from 2015 to 2017, Effort-Sharing emissions in the EU Member States and the United Kingdom decreased by 0.9 % in 2018 to a level 10.8 % (309 Mt CO e) below that of 2005. This was below the corresponding target level for the period 2013-2020 (Figure 1). Between 2005 and 2018, the largest reduction in Effort Sharing emissions took place in the heating and cooling of buildings (155 Mt CO e) (Figure 2; Figure 3). Emissions were also reduced in the waste management sector (66 Mt CO e) and in small industries (61 Mt CO e). The transport and agriculture sectors only contributed to small reductions in the Effort Sharing sectors (25 Mt CO e and 2 Mt CO e, respectively) during this period. Today — more than halfway through the 2005-2030 period — the total reduction achieved so far in the Effort Sharing sectors represents only one third of the reduction needed by 2030 to achieve the target of a 30 % reduction compared with 2005 in these sectors. From 2018 onwards, the annual rate of emission reductions at EU level needs to nearly double to achieve the cuts foreseen under the Effort Sharing Regulation. If Member States and the United Kingdom were to implement the additional policies and measures that are already planned, Effort Sharing emissions could decrease to a level 27 % below that of 2005 by 2030, according to projections reported by Member States and the United Kingdom to the EEA under the Mechanism Regulation in March 2019. Most of these reductions are expected in the transport, buildings and industry sectors, while agriculture remains the sector where countries do not foresee any significant change in emissions over the next decade. The aggregated reduction in the Effort Sharing sectors would still fall short of the expected contribution from Effort Sharing sectors towards the EU’s 2030 target. More action is therefore needed at a national level to decarbonise their economies further and faster. The next section focuses on each of the main Effort Sharing sectors, highlighting key emission trends and the national climate policies that aim to reduce these emissions. Transport — without aviation, which is covered by the EU ETS — is responsible for more than one third of emissions from the Effort Sharing sectors. It is the largest sector covered by Effort Sharing legislation. Transport has only played a minor role in curbing Effort Sharing emissions so far, with a reduction of just 25 Mt CO e between 2005 and 2018 (Figure 3). The sector’s emission trend shows the key role played by this sector in driving total Effort Sharing emissions upwards since 2014, as a result of the growing demand for passenger and freight road transport (Figure 2). The net reductions achieved so far can be attributed to the improved energy efficiency of vehicles and the introduction of low carbon fuels. Countries expect a significant change in transport emission trends, with large reductions expected, in particular in road transport. However, these projected reductions mostly rely on additional measures that are still to be adopted and fully implemented (Figure 3). Most of the 111 planned measures on transport  target Of these 111 measures, 34 are associated with quantified expected emission savings by 2030, as reported by eight Member States (Czechia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania and Spain). Estonia is the Member State reporting the largest expected reduction of its national transport emissions from transport policies by 2030. Estonia provided quantified reductions of transport policies such as the improvement of the efficiency of the transport system, the implementation of a passenger car registration system and annual road usage fees for passenger cars. Other examples of quantified policies ad measures include energy-efficiency improvements of cars and vans and promoting the use of biofuels in the transport sector in Finland, as well as the implementation of incentives for the use of combined freight transport in Lithuania. Heating and cooling activities of residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions in the Effort Sharing sectors, the second biggest source after transport. Fluctuations in weather conditions from one year to another (i.e. warmer or colder winters) are an important cause of annual variations in this sector’s emissions. However, emissions over the period 2005-2018 show a clearly decreasing trend (Figure 2Figure 3). This can be linked to several policy-driven factors, in particular the increasing energy efficiency of buildings and the switch to less carbon intensive fuels, including renewable energy sources for heating and cooling. Countries expect emission cuts from heating and cooling in the building sector to continue as a result of the further implementation of existing measures and the introduction of additional measures. In 2019, 18 Member States reported information to the EEA regarding 73 planned policies and measures targeting improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings . These encompass the With 17 % of total Effort Sharing emissions at EU level, agriculture is the third largest source of emissions in the Effort Sharing sectors. With emission trends in this sector nearly constant between 2005 and 2018, this sector has hardly contributed to reductions in the Effort Sharing sectors (Figure 2). Projections indicate that countries plan rather low emission reductions in this sector (Figure 3). In 2019, 12 Member States reported information on 55 planned policies or measures targeting greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture . These measures most commonly aim at Policies and measures reported are often related to the implementation of European policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy, the Nitrates Directive and the Renewable Energy Directive. Five Member States (Finland, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, and Spain), reported quantified reduction effects in 2030 for 14 of their planned measures. Lithuania reported measures expected to deliver significant reductions in its agriculture emissions (more than 10 %), including the provision of compensatory support to farms for emission-reducing activities, the development of organic farming and the amendment of mandatory requirements for the use of mineral nitrogen fertilisers. Spain reported quantified information on a measure supporting the improvement of animal waste management systems there. This sector, referred to as ‘small industry and other’ in this briefing, covers emissions from energy industries, manufacturing and production industries, fugitive emissions and industrial processes that are not covered by the EU ETS. Fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions as also included. The sector saw emissions substantially decrease between 2005 and 2018 (-61 Mt CO e) (Figure 2). These reductions resulted primarily from improvements in energy efficiency. Planned policies and measures addressing these emissions typically include energy efficiency measures for industrial installations and the promotion of renewable energy. Many of these measures also affect emissions covered by the EU ETS. While the waste management sector is by far the smallest sector in terms of its contribution to Effort Sharing emissions, it delivered the second largest reduction in Effort Sharing emissions between 2005 and 2018 (-66 Mt CO e) (Figure 3) and the largest relative reduction (-33 %). These reductions were mainly driven by measures aiming to improve waste management, to limit the quantity of landfilled waste and improve landfill management, as well as better treatment technologies and enhanced recycling. Countries expect limited additional emission reductions in this sector. Only 7 Member States reported information on 15 planned policies and measures, which include Germany, Lithuania and Spain provided quantified expected reduction effects for 2030 as a result of 5 policies or measures. Effects included the minimisation of the amount of landfilled waste in Lithuania and a set of measures in Spain (prevention of waste generation, household composting, separate collection of organic matter for biological treatment and separate collection of other fractions such as paper, cooking oil and textiles for recycling, and the promotion of the use of renewable gases), which would reduce these countries’ waste emissions by 35 % and 19 %, respectively. Evidently, reported information on emission savings expected from national policies and measures in the Effort Sharing sectors remains insufficient. Further monitoring and evaluation of the effects of policy at national level is clearly needed to identify the most effective measures to achieve climate neutrality in the EU.   , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing   In 2019, the EU-wide share of renewable energy was less than half a percentage point below the binding 20% target for 2020 (EEA, 2020a, 2020d, Eurostat 2021). At 34% of all electricity generation, renewable electricity has almost doubled since 2005, and coal no longer supplies most of the EU’s electricity. However,  still altogether (38% of all generation in 2019). With combustion-based installations dominating the power mix, the EU electricity sector gives rise to almost a quarter of all EU greenhouse gas emissions. It also remains an important source of acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone formation (EEA, 2020b). Offering the potential for rapid expansion, renewable electricity plays a leading role in Europe’s decarbonisation strategy (EC, 2020a, 2020b, 2020d). Except for biomass and the biodegradable fraction of waste, renewable power sources have negligible emissions during generation. But, even so, increasing the renewable power supply is not impact free, because constructing renewable power generation components and plants is both material and energy intensive. That leads to specific upstream and downstream emissions and impacts, while new infrastructure can affect vulnerable habitats. Going beyond climate mitigation, a detailed life cycle analysis was undertaken to calculate global changes in overall environmental impacts associated with the trends in the EU power mix between 2005 and 2018, especially given the shift towards increasing shares of renewable electricity generation. The aim was to estimate how key environmental impacts had changed by 2018, thanks to the increase of renewable sources in the electricity supply across the EU, relative to the benchmark year 2005. Officially reported annual generation data for 16 main renewable and conventional power technologies in each Member State and at EU level were used to provide insights on six essential environmental impact categories:   By looking at both upstream and downstream parts of the value chain, life cycle analysis can also highlight interactions between domestic measures and global pressures because of the growing complexity of international trade.     Unsurprisingly, the results show that, in 2018, annual life cycle continued to be combustion, followed by emissions from natural gas and oil burning (Figure 1). Since combustion-related emissions affect many categories  ,  Compared with 2005, the increase in renewable electricity generation by 2018 had significantly decreased life cycle greenhouse gas emissions at the EU level. In fact, for most of the impact categories investigated, the switch from fossil fuel to renewable electricity sources resulted in clear improvements in 2018, compared with 2005: at the EU level, the life cycle impact potentials of eutrophication, particulate matter formation and acidification were all lower in 2018 than in 2005. For   and for  , however, the life cycle impact intensities are more evenly spread across renewable and non-renewable sources, with the exception of clear outliers such as ecotoxic impact intensities associated with electricity generation from municipal solid waste and land occupation intensities associated with electricity produced from solid biomass. Consequently, the analysis indicates that substituting fossil fuels with a growing share of renewable electricity across the EU has increased impact potentials for freshwater ecotoxicity and land occupation by 2018, compared with 2005. These findings are in line with the International Resource Panel’s landmark study on the benefits, risks and trade-offs of low-carbon technologies for electricity production (UNEP, 2016). That assessment also found that renewable power requires larger amounts of metals and other minerals per unit of electricity generated, while generally having consistently lower environmental impacts than power generated from fossil fuels in nearly all impact categories investigated. Whereas for freshwater ecotoxicity the potential increase is related to increases in solar photovoltaic (PV) power and in the incineration of biodegradable municipal waste (and to lesser extents to geothermal power), for land occupation the deterioration is associated with increases in biomass use and solar PV power  . Small, but noticeable, impacts are also observed for particulate matter formation, related to increased biomass generation. These overall trade-offs are partially compensated for by a simultaneous increase in the contribution of other renewable electricity sources. Changes in gross electricity generation are accounted for in the figure (gross electricity generation in 2018 is 1% higher than in 2005). GHG, greenhouse gas. ETC/CME, 2020   These changes came about because of shifts from coal to natural gas and renewables-based generation in most Member States since 2005. Most of the avoided impacts were driven by an increase in electricity generation from onshore wind power and solar PV sources, followed by electricity generation from solid and gaseous biomass fuels. A considerable part of the avoided impacts can be attributed to the    in favour of renewable and natural gas generation. The life cycle improvements related to the EU’s power supply are especially clear when these estimates are compared with a counterfactual scenario that freezes the share of renewable electricity generation at the 2005 level. In the counterfactual scenario, the growth in renewable power is replaced every year by a mix of conventional sources that changes with the relative annual share of each fossil fuel in the generation mix. The results of this stylised comparison show that the increased use of solar PV and wind power have contributed significantly to reducing life cycle pressures across the impact indicators investigated. One trade-off is that the growth in renewable electricity appears to have increased the potential ecotoxicity- and land occupation-related impacts of Europe’s power supply, as shown in Figure 2. ETC/CME, 2020   Fully implementing national climate and energy plans for 2030 would allow the EU to overachieve its current climate and renewable energy targets for 2030 (EC, 2020c; EEA, 2020d). Such developments, however, would still be insufficient for the EU to meet a higher target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, of 55% by 2030, or to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 (EC, 2020d).  To meet these higher pledges,  to almost 70% of all EU generation by 2030 and to over 80% by 2050 (EC, 2020a; EEA, 2020c), allowing sectors that are harder to decarbonise to reduce their emissions through electrification. Investments in the renewable electricity supply need to be ramped up to meet those targets and speed up the energy transition. Furthermore, higher carbon prices under the EU Emission Trading Scheme would make renewable power sources more competitive  (see also EEA, 2020c). By substituting more polluting fossil fuels, expanding renewable electricity generation across the EU provides multiple opportunities to improve human health and the environment while mitigating climate change. However,       and potentially other targeted measures will need to accompany these trends to avoid environmental problem shifting, including in areas not addressed by this study. Other critical tools for policymakers will be improvements in cross-sectoral energy and resource efficiency and giving special attention to the planning, design, selection and siting of projects depending on the habitats, species and ecosystems potentially affected.   Several processes and emissions associated with renewable electricity generation lead to high life cycle impacts. However, opportunities to decrease relative and total impact intensities do exist, despite considerable differences in the life cycle impacts of the national electricity supply sectors. Solar PV has a relatively high impact intensity for ecotoxicity because of the emissions of metal,   related to mining and smelting operations, and chlorine from the purification of solar-grade silicon. Reducing the demand for raw materials, e.g. by prioritising better , can lower process emissions, bringing down the corresponding life cycle emissions for solar PV power generation. Solar PV power’s greenhouse gas impact intensity is also among the highest of all renewable sources across the value chain. Emissions accumulate from a collection of processes, each contributing a little. As the construction of solar PV modules requires both heat and electricity and takes place globally, the cumulative effect leads to relatively high total emissions of greenhouse gases. Increasing the reliance on   would help to bring down the emission intensity of solar PV components. For biodegradable municipal solid waste, almost all ecotoxicity impact potentials arise from the incineration process itself, offering potential opportunities to mitigate impacts by adopting more  . Similarly, for particulate matter formation linked to biomass fuels, process emission contributions are highest during burning, indicating a potential to install further emission control measures. In addition, focusing efforts on  , such as third-generation biofuels, could considerably reduce the overall high land use intensity associated with the current fuel supply chains.    to reduce the need for standby generation during peak consumption, measures to improve  across end use sectors, and more sustainable,   proposed under the circular economy action plan could further reduce some of the potential negative impacts associated with the transition to renewable power supplies, while simultaneously increasing its cost-effectiveness. For non-combustible power sources, measures also include   to reduce the emission intensity linked to upstream and downstream processes. Finally, efforts to improve the   are essential to reduce adverse trade-offs associated with the energy transition. This briefing considers the changes in the EU power sector since 2005 across six key impact categories. Other dimensions that are important to ensure a sustainable transition across the sector were not included in this assessment. Ranging from impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (following, for example, changes in land use and in river ecology and morphology) to resource depletion, understanding and addressing these aspects will prove essential to avoid and reduce future impacts, as renewable electricity is set to grow.     Life cycle analysis is a quantitative approach for assessing products in terms of their environmental, human health and resource consumption impacts. The method enables a generic assessment of environmental impacts that occur globally across supply chains. The work is based on constant impact factors, leading to impact potentials, which are then compared to identify environmental problem shifting and potential hot spots in value chains. However, the approach should not be confused with assessments based on more detailed estimates of emissions and impacts, e.g. atmospheric dispersion of air pollutant emissions and subsequent impacts on human health. The analysis includes activities related to materials and fuel extraction, transport and refining, the construction of (plant) components and infrastructure, plant operation and end-of-life plant decommissioning.   Information on national  Data on emissions of      [ ] Combustion processes are a main source of key air pollutant emissions, especially sulphur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ) and carbon monoxide, of particulate matter (PM , PM ) and heavy metals (such as mercury, lead and cadmium) and of persistent organic pollutants (in particular hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyl). Most of these pollutants are linked to coal combustion. [ ]  [ ] Mainly copper and, to a lesser extent, silver, nickel and zinc.

The Commission has put in place different building blocks for a sustainable finance system: The first European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA) identifies 36 climate risks that pose a threat to Europe’s energy and food security, ecosystems, infrastructure, water resources, financial stability, and people’s health.  Many climate impacts can affect the economy and the financial system, from where they can cascade further to other policy areas that may be deprived of financial resources. To accelerate the green transition, Europe needs a solid socio-economic and fiscal policy framework to ensure the European Green Deal is smoothly implemented in the upcoming EU institutional cycle.  This requires some clear political decisions and good policymaking, namely within fiscal and industrial policies. New green industrial policies can help overcome limitations in public finance for the green transition.

Briefing   The   aims to transform the EU into a climate-neutral, fair and prosperous society with a circular economy by 2050. The   reiterates the EU’s long-term 2050 vision of living well, within planetary boundaries. These ambitions are to be achieved through ‘sustainability transitions’ that require radical changes to our core systems of production and consumption — energy, mobility, food and the built environment — as well as to our established ways of living and working. The commitment of the European Green Deal to ‘leave no one behind’ and the commitment of the   to build a fairer more inclusive society, provide overarching guiding principles for just sustainability transitions that together with concrete measures and initiatives, are a clear recognition of how the social and environmental problems facing Europe are interwoven. These instruments intend to safeguard social welfare and ensure a fair and just transition to climate-neutral societies, acknowledging that inequalities exist between regions in Europe and that certain social groups will be disproportionately affected. They include the   (including the  ), which was launched in 2020, the subsequent   and the  . Recent research from the United Nations and the EEA highlights the  , who often have a lower share of the responsibility for creating environmental problems (EEA, 2022, IPCC, 2022). These groups will also bear significant future costs from adaptation to the impacts of climate change, pollution and environmental degradation. While the EU sets the direction for just and equitable transitions, an understanding is still lacking in terms of how justice considerations and environmental sustainability goals can be jointly delivered through effective policy interventions (Avelino et al., 2023). For instance, the recently agreed   broadens the debate around justice to include nature and the environment and extends the focus from protecting ecosystems to restoring degraded or destroyed ecosystems. There is a need to document experiences and develop recommendations on how to design, implement and evaluate policies to achieve just sustainability transitions for humans and other species in nature. This briefing is a first step towards addressing this need by describing some of the key elements and relationships.   Sustainability transitions are processes of long-term structural change towards more sustainable societal systems. They include profound changes in ways of doing, thinking and organising, as well as in underlying institutions and values (Loorbach et al., 2017). This entails decisions about the direction of change, in a context where there are many legitimate perspectives on desirable futures and how to reach them. The effective governance of transitions requires participatory processes that enable a diverse set of stakeholders to identify shared visions and goals, and credible pathways to reach them. Prerequisites include democratising access to environmental information, increasing public participation in decision-making and providing access to justice in environmental matters as laid out in the  . Large-scale, systemic change involves trade-offs. It creates winners and losers and may trigger unintended outcomes that disproportionately affect vulnerable territories and social groups. This can exacerbate existing inequalities and generate resistance to change (Agyeman, 2013; Swilling, 2020). The concepts of inequality, justice and equity are themselves complex as Figure 1 below illustrates. Achieving sustainability will have significant distributional consequences, making it critical to pay careful attention to equity considerations (IPCC, 2022). Policies should monitor and anticipate potential losses and the unequal distribution of costs and benefits arising from systemic changes with the aim of sharing these costs across society (EEA, 2022). Sustainability transitions can be considered as ‘just’ when these processes of transformative change ‘improve the quality of life of current and future generations, both human and non-human, within ecological boundaries while eliminating injustices that are triggered or exacerbated by unsustainability and its underlying causes’ (Avelino et al., 2023).  EEA, 2024. Adapted from Tony Ruth from Maeda (2019) with  .   When considering how to capture the concepts of justice in sustainability transition policies, it is useful to distinguish between the key dimensions of justice as described below. relates to how the costs and benefits of human activity, as well as policies to manage these activities, are allocated across our society and to other species in the natural environment, as well as to the values and principles according to which goods and services are allocated. It concerns not only which entities pay costs and which receive benefits, but also their perceptions of what constitutes a cost or a benefit (Langemeyer and Connolly, 2020; Biermann and Kalfagianni, 2020; Wijsman and Berbés-Blázquez, 2022). Sustainability transitions must also tackle existing injustices linked to environmental degradation and climate change. Air pollution poses the greatest environmental health risk in Europe but the impacts of air pollution are unequally distributed across our society. Fine particulate matter (PM ) causes more premature deaths in Europe than any other ambient air pollutant. Monitoring PM  levels is therefore considered useful for exploring income-related inequalities in the distribution of the health impacts of air pollution.  . In an environmentally equal Europe, poverty and pollution would not be correlated. However, monitoring data shows that despite improvements in air quality in both the richest and poorest regions of the EU 2007 and 2020, inequalities remain, with levels of PM  concentrations consistently higher by around one third in the poorest regions. This shows a lack of progress in reducing disparities in exposure to air pollution across Europe (EEA, 2023). focuses on fairness in the institutions, procedures and practices of decision-making, and the judicial processes and the extent to which these are inclusive. It looks at who participates in and benefits from decision-making processes and why, and how to define and deliver inclusive participation. This entails the identification and inclusion of those entities typically not represented in decision-making and judicial processes, such as homeless people, undocumented people, socially excluded groups, children, future generations and other species in nature, such as animals and plants (Langemeyer and Connolly, 2020; Wijsman and Berbés-Blázquez, 2022). The EU and its 27 Member States are all parties to the   – the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters. The convention aims to ensure environmental democracy by laying down a set of basic procedural rights for the public, imposing obligations on public authorities to make these rights effective, increasing transparency and making governments more accountable to people. The Aarhus Convention is translated into EU law through several legislative acts. The   aims to ensure that environmental information is systematically made available by the authorities to the public either actively or upon request. The   2003/35/EC provides for public participation when formulating certain plans and programmes relating to the environment. Provisions for public participation in environmental decision-making are also found in a number of environmental directives, such as the   and the  . implies the recognition of underlying systemic injustices and representation of dignity, values and identities of humans and other species. When referencing humans, this dimension refers both to individuals and social groups and entails recognising and respecting how different values, preferences and needs are rooted in diverse histories, identities and cultural backgrounds. For other species, this implies recognising the intrinsic and inherent value of nature regardless of its utility to humans (Wijsman and Berbés-Blázquez, 2022). A recent report published in 2020 documents cases of  , whereby Roma people were living in marginal and polluted areas, without access to basic services such as water and sanitation. These poor environmental conditions seriously impact their health and welfare (EEB, 2020). The non-governmental organisations, the European Environmental Bureau and the European Roma Grassroots Organisations Network, have highlighted the environmental injustice and social inequality the Roma communities face and are campaigning for recognitional justice for these marginalized communities (EEB, 2024).   The need for adaptation to climate change is increasingly urgent. Adaptation strategies and plans are being progressively developed and implemented across Europe. Ensuring that no one is left behind requires a focus on equity and the meaningful engagement of vulnerable groups at all stages of adaptation planning, implementation and monitoring. EU policies and instruments such as the   and the   emphasis on higher levels of citizen engagement. A recent EEA briefing,   looks at how climate change affects vulnerable groups and how these impacts can be prevented or reduced through equitable adaptation actions. It also presents examples of how vulnerable groups are already involved in developing equity-oriented policies and measures in some European countries. For example, in Finland, children, youth, the elderly and the Sami indigenous people were consulted on climate change planning. In Slovenia, municipalities engage with those particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts as they are required to consult with representative organisations on a wide range of activities from civil protection in natural disasters to elderly care (EEA, 2023). Our understanding of justice in sustainability transitions is strengthened by considering the three dimensions of justice through the interplay between them and five  of justice that together make the picture more complete. The extent to which individuals connect to different dimensions of justice depends upon their circumstances. For example, an individual’s age, sexuality, gender, ethnicity, nationality, socio-economic and legal status may influence their perception of justice as well as their access to it. Without acknowledging such  , policymakers may fail to understand the diversity of society and therefore be at risk of addressing the needs of certain groups while neglecting others (Crenshaw, 1989; Gonzalez, 2020). In addition, an individual or group’s  to mobilise resources, participate in decision-making processes and take advantage of the opportunities that policies may offer will vary (Bierman and Kalfagianni, 2020; Nussbaum, 2011). In evidence-based policymaking, an important aspect is how knowledge, including indigenous knowledge, is recognised and treated as relevant, valid, and legitimate in problem-framing and decision-making.   entails the exclusion of individuals or groups from the process of creating and assessing knowledge (Fricker, 2007; Wijsman and Feagan, 2019; Ghosh et al, 2021). The spatial and temporal reach of policies affect their effectiveness in delivering justice.   concerns the geographic area addressed by legislation and the level at which it is implemented, be it local, regional, national or international (Langemeyer and Connolly, 2020; Soja, 2010; Stevis and Felli, 2020). concerns how policies address issues of justice over time, for example, the needs of future generations for a safe and healthy environment, and the responsibility of current generations to restore past environmental degradation (Langemeyer and Connolly, 2020; Gonzalez, 2020). The resulting conceptual framework for just sustainability transitions is categorised according to different dimensions of justice and concepts for justice as presented in Figure 2. Taranto, a city in southern Italy, has been faced with social, economic and environmental challenges due to a dependency on the iron and steel industry. A grassroots initiative called  , aiming to transition the local economy from steel manufacturing to tourism and agroecology, includes efforts to restore brownfield sites and contaminated industrial land, and to find new sustainable ways to reuse industrial buildings in line with circular economy principles. The local community has been involved in developing and steering the plan, which prioritises both distributional and recognitional justice. The plan aims to ensure that people impacted negatively by the changes are given a voice, directly addressing concerns about job losses. The creation of new jobs, notably in agroecology, not only supports the community but also contributes to easing environmental pressures.  EEA, 2024.  There are different types of justice each with a focus on particular themes or domains. Examples include epistemic justice, climate justice, energy justice, food justice, urban justice and restorative justice. The three dimensions of justice mentioned earlier (distribution, procedure, and recognition) and the five concepts of justice (intersectionality, capabilities, epistemologies, spatiality and temporality) are critical across all those different thematic and domain-specific types of justice.   Restorative justice recognises how past inequities continue to shape present conditions and aims to address these injustices, deliver resolution, and enable healing (Forsyth et al., 2022; McCauley and Heffron, 2018). It is particularly relevant when remediating degraded environments and addressing the impacts of climate change. The Nature Restoration Law, for example, provisionally agreed in November 2023, extends the focus from protecting ecosystems to restoring degraded or destroyed ecosystems. (see box on the Nature Restoration Law). In the context of sustainability transitions, restorative justice centres on processes to compensate for past harm to humans and other species and ecosystems. Such processes involve multiple stakeholders with diverse perspectives and focus on identifiable harm and victims, and the individuals, groups and institutions that take responsibility and can be held accountable for harm. Restorative justice is also important in the design of new policies, which must avoid causing intergenerational impacts. Outcomes can take the form of financial compensation for losses, or the restoration of natural areas degraded through human activity. This may include operations to restore land and aquatic ecosystems, while ensuring that remediation efforts do not impact negatively on vulnerable communities (Forsyth et al., 2022). An example of steps towards restorative justice in a European country is the response to the detection of large-scale soil and groundwater pollution around a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) production plant in Antwerp, Belgium operated by 3M (Vito, 2022). Following several months of negotiation, 3M agreed to pay EUR 571 million in response to the pollution near its factory including: EUR 250 million for priority remedial actions, EUR 100 million to the Flemish Government for PFAS related actions and EUR 100 million to support the Oosterweel project to complete the Antwerp ring road where the pollution was first revealed. More recently and in response to follow-up efforts to test the blood of nearby residents for contamination with PFAS, 3M has been ordered by a court in Antwerp to pay provisional damages of EUR 2,000 in compensation to a local family whose blood was contaminated by its activities. The European Green Deal launched in December 2019 sets out an ambitious roadmap to transform the European Union into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, published in May 2020, couples these aims with a zero-pollution ambition and cross-cutting environmental objectives to achieve climate-neutrality, recover biodiversity, and restore degraded ecosystems.  , provisionally agreed on in November 2023, and the European Climate Law adopted the year prior, will be important steps towards delivering the key commitments of the European Green Deal and are central to achieving overarching EU climate and biodiversity objectives. The Nature Restoration Law is the first piece of legislation explicitly focused on the restoration of nature in EU Member States. It will support the recovery of degraded ecosystems by improving their structure and functions to enhance biodiversity and its resilience. It sets a binding target at EU level and requires Member States to implement effective restoration measures on at least 20% of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030. By 2050, measures should be in place for all ecosystems in need of restoration. This target builds on the international commitment undertaken by the EU and its countries as a party to the global  . The main instruments of the Nature Restoration Law are the national restoration plans, where Member States will identify restoration measures required to meet the binding targets set in the law and specify the total area to be restored, as well as a timeline covering the period up to 2050. The preparation, review, and implementation of national restoration plans incorporate procedural justice ensuring access to environmental information and involving key stakeholders in public decision-making processes. In line with the Aarhus Convention, the plans should document information on public participation and how the needs of local communities and the general public have been considered. It also contains elements of recognitional justice and aims to restore nature in all ecosystems, including forests, agricultural land, marine, freshwater, and urban ecosystems. Restoration is framed as living and producing together with nature by improving biodiversity across all land and sea, including areas where economic activity takes place, such as managed forests, agricultural land, and cities. In terms of distributional justice, Member States should explore opportunities to promote the deployment of private and public support schemes that benefit stakeholders implementing restoration measures.   The definitions above explain the different dimensions of justice and how an individual’s or group’s circumstances can affect their access to justice. What does this mean for efforts to deliver justice in the context of sustainability transitions? Efforts to deliver justice tend to focus on certain social groups while neglecting other social groups and, indeed, other species in nature. For example, without adequate compensatory measures and educational support for reskilling, members of communities dependent on coal mining for their livelihoods may not consider efforts to transition to green energy to be just. It is necessary to consider the needs of a broad range of social groups in the context of achieving just sustainability transitions. Justice is a complex and multi-dimensional concept and therefore processes to deliver justice within the context of sustainability transitions will inevitably be subject to blind spots and unpredictability. For instance, when considering justice in our food systems globally, we may overlook injustices at the local level and vice versa. We may also prioritise justice for humans at the cost of other species. Policymakers face the challenge of capturing multiple dimensions, while acknowledging likely blind spots.  Sustainability transitions are characterised by tensions and conflicting trade-offs. For instance, there is a trade-off between the urgent need to address the unequal distribution of the impacts of climate change on the one hand and the time required for inclusive decision-making on the other hand. When prioritising certain dimensions of justice over others, it is important to be transparent about the rationale and how this affects processes and outcomes. Every intervention and every decision not to intervene runs the risk of having unintended consequences that generate injustices. For instance, greening urban areas and implementing nature-based solutions may lead to green gentrification, rising property prices and the displacement of marginalised communities. Policymakers should therefore seek to anticipate negative consequences and, where possible, prevent them or compensate the affected groups.  Delivering justice requires a continuous commitment and a process to assess progress. While policymakers cannot always anticipate the negative impacts of policies, building in processes to evaluate polices can enable them to identify injustices in terms of distribution, procedure and recognition, and adjust policies to redress such impacts. For example, taxes on energy consumption are often regressive, disproportionately burden lower-income households and can in some cases exacerbate existing inequalities or create new ones.  This briefing presents a framework for understanding justice in the context of sustainability transitions. Policy interventions aiming to foster transitions towards sustainable futures operate across complex societal systems at different scales. As such outcomes can be unpredictable. Such broad sustainability transition policies have the intention of creating better outcomes but are unlikely to completely avoid unjust impacts. In the next phase of our work on justice in sustainability transitions, the EEA will use this conceptual framework to develop recommendations to support the design, implementation, and evaluation of just sustainability transition policies that ‘leave no one behind’.

There has been growing interest in systems thinking and anticipatory knowledge within EU institutions in view of designing better-informed and ultimately more effective policies. The future of Europe's environment and sustainability is likely to be highly influenced by developments of societal, technological, economic, environmental and geopolitical natures, as well as changes in values and lifestyles. These 'drivers of change' differ from each other in relation to their origin, nature, likelihood, significance, geographical scale and timescale. Although some of them are well established and well known, some have just emerged, and their effects have not yet unfolded or are still unknown. In order to explore even further the characteristics, interactions and potential implications of the ‘drivers of change’, the EEA has developed and identified six thematic clusters using the STEEPV framework (i.e. society, technology, economy, environment, politics and values): : The width of the connectors illustrates a qualitative estimation of the strength of the interaction among drivers of change.  See the EEA’s latest report on "},

Briefing Conducting the UK’s first VNR has yielded many lessons and insights. The UK recognises that the 17 SDGs represent a framework for addressing the cross-cutting challenges facing the UK and the world today. They yield interlinkages which the government, business and civil society can collaborate on to develop holistic long-term solutions that benefit society as a whole and contribute to several SDGs simultaneously (HM Government, 2019). The UK has a strong story to tell domestically on many of the SDGs, including progress made on climate and the environment. At the same time, it acknowledges that there are areas that require boosting the country’s efforts further to address climate and environmental issues (HM Government, 2019). The country is proud of its commitment to leave the environment in a better state than it inherited.  Sustainable agriculture is at the heart of this commitment.  On SDG 2, steps are being taken across the UK to improve the sustainability of farming and food production. For SDG 6, the UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan sets out a range of measures to achieve clean and plentiful water. There has been important progress in recent years. For example, England now has consistently high levels of clean bathing waters, serious pollution incidents are steadily declining, and rivers that were biologically dead are being revived (HM Government, 2019).  The UK adopts a holistic approach to all 17 SDGs. The country’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus mainly on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. On SDG 7, the UK is working on making energy affordable for all and to sustain improvements in energy efficiency. Its ambition is to meet its climate change commitments at the lowest possible cost to British taxpayers, consumers and businesses, while being at the forefront of clean technologies and maximising the social and economic benefits of the global shift to clean growth (HM Government, 2019). On SDG 11, the UK is focusing on building sustainable cities and infrastructure of the future to face the challenges of natural disasters, changing climates, and shifting populations (HM Government, 2019). On SDG 12, the ‘Greening Government Commitments’ identified a set of actions for the UK government to reduce their impacts on the environment. Citizens and business are also encouraged to be responsible for their environmental impact. The UK is working to minimise waste, promote resource efficiency, and move towards a circular economy. The introduction of the carrier-bag charge and landfill tax are considered to have shown significant impacts on such behavioural shifts (HM Government, 2019). The government is working with its fishing industry and marine scientists to ensure sustainable fish stocks. The UK is a forerunner of global efforts to tackle marine plastic and has introduced a strict ban on microbeads. Further action will focus on the impacts of climate change on the ocean (SDG 14) (HM Government, 2019). The condition of the country’s land ecosystems (SDG 15) continues to be affected by land use, pollution, invasive alien species, and climate change. Although the decline in the number and distribution of certain species have slowed, action must continue. Therefore, the UK is focusing its action on better protection of ecosystems, improved management of protected sites, incentives for farming and woodland management, and funding for peatland restoration (HM Government, 2019). In preparations for the VNR, the country conducted wide stakeholder engagement across the UK through case studies, events or by providing feedback electronically. The VNR outlined both good practices and key areas where further action is required (HM Government, 2019). Several charities have come together to establish the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD), a multi-stakeholder network aiming to inspire and support public, private and voluntary organisations. The work of the UKSSD has been complemented by the Bond SDGs Group, a civil society coalition of over 150 organisations advocating the full implementation of the SDGs (UK, 2017a). Project Everyone (a UK-based non-profit organisation that aims to ‘mak[e]ing the SDGs famous’] has also pursued efforts to promote the SDGs at the international level (UK, 2017a). In the UK, the Secretary of State for the Department for International Development (DFID) has overall responsibility for overseeing implementation of the SDGs, working closely with the Cabinet Office to ensure that they are incorporated throughout government structures (UK, 2017a). The role of the Cabinet Office is to ensure that the goals are integrated into departments’ Single Departmental Plans (SDPs). The underlying aims of the SDGs are reflected in the UK government’s work programme and, as such, are embedded in the SDPs. An interdepartmental group on the SDGs across the UK government on the Goals, co-chaired by officials in the DFID and Cabinet Office, also provides governance for the overall process in the UK (UK, 2017a). The UK submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. The UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) is committed to sourcing data that gives the clearest picture of the UK’s contribution to the SDGs. As of June 2019, the ONS reports UK data on 180 (74 %) indicators of the total 244.The ONS has created a portal for gathering and disseminating the UK’s national SDG indicators and the relevant data (ONS, 2017a). This reporting platform has a dual purpose: to make national data on the SDGs publicly available and to provide a collection point for the relevant agencies who need UK data to prepare the clustered global figure reported to the UN (ONS, 2017b).

Briefing In 2016, the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a plan of action for marine conservation and sustainable fisheries, together with an allocation of over EUR 180 million. The new initiatives are a further step in the Ministry's implementation of its 10-point Plan of Action for Marine Conservation and Sustainable Fisheries. Based on the need to implement the 2030 Agenda, especially SDG 14 (life below water), Germany launched a federal research and development funding programme, MAREN, where the ‘N’ stands for sustainability (Nachhaltigkeit) (Federal Republic of Germany, 2016). Germany's action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 3, 12, 13, 14 and 15.   In Germany, stakeholders and citizens have played an important role in planning and progressing towards SDGs with an environmental dimension. Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) emphasises that a broad societal consensus on the SDGs is a precondition for achieving them. The varied and numerous activities of the ‘Fridays for Future’ initiatives in Germany have increased the pressure on the government to be more active on environmental protection issues. The example of the Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment shows that stakeholders play an important role in Germany’s efforts to find sustainable answers to structural change questions. In June 2018, the Commission was convened by the federal government to develop a social consensus around structural changes to energy and climate policy in Germany. The Commission comprised members from industry and the economy, science, environmental associations and unions as well as representatives of the lignite mining regions. In January 2019, the Commission presented its final report which includes recommendations for measures to promote the social and structural development of lignite mining regions. The federal government has stated that it intends to implement the Commission's results. The country experienced several barriers to action on SDGs with an environmental dimension, including the challenge of ensuring policy coherence. This requires the coherent, coordinated deployment of all policy instruments to advance the SDGs. Furthermore, cooperation between the federal government and theLänderis challenging. The GermanLänderplay a crucial role in SDG action as they have legislative and administrative powers in vital areas of sustainable development (Federal Republic of Germany, 2016). Even though regularly collected representative data on environmental awareness in Germany shows a high level of awareness of issues relevant to sustainable development, only around 10 % of people in the country were aware of the SDGs in 2018. Because the population’s support is vital for making environmental SDGs a success, the German federal government initiated a campaign to make them better known. Germany submitted a VNR to the UN in 2016. The most important enabling factor for implementing the SDGs in Germany is the institutional architecture for the G National Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) and the fact that the primary responsibility for the GSDS lies with the federal chancellery. The GSDS outlines how the guiding principle of sustainability is to be implemented in the federal government’s current and future work. The Committee of State Secretaries on Sustainable Development steers progress on the GSDS and oversees its revision (Thomson, 2017). The work and interaction of the State Secretaries’ Committee on Sustainable Development (StA NHK), the Parliamentary Advisory Council on Sustainable Development (PBnE) and the Sustainable Development Council (RNE) have proven to be effective and will be continued. The aim of the StA NHK is to focus cooperation between the ministries’ various policy areas on common sustainable development through implementation of the GSDS and the SDGs. The PBnE plays an important role at the interface between society and politics. The RNE has a dual function: it is a stakeholder in the social dialogue on sustainability and an advisor to the federal government. In 2018, the federal chancellery initiated a process to revise the GSDS and align it with the 2030 Agenda. The process involved all ministries, the parliament, the federal state, authorities at the regional and local level, civil society, the private sector and academia (Federal Republic of Germany, 2016). The updated GSDS constitutes a framework for tracking Germany’s progress towards the 2030 Agenda. Tools include biannual monitoring reports by the Federal Statistical Office as well as four-year progress reports on the GSDS (Thomson, 2017). In June 2018, all members of the public, associations and organisations were once again — as was the case when the 2016 German Sustainable Development Strategy was drafted — invited to contribute their own ideas to the process of compiling the updated GSDS. Currently, updating the GSDS also takes place in dialogue with the population. Around 1 500 citizens took part in dialogue conferences nationwide from October 2019 to February 2020. The GSDS highlights the need to strengthen the involvement of societal stakeholders. In recent years, for example, the Sustainability Forum and the Science Platform Sustainability 2030 were established. The Forum is held annually and helps the federal government to communicate with key stakeholders about the status and future of implementation of the Sustainable Development Strategy and the 2030 Agenda. The platform is intended as an interface between academia, society and policy to support implementation of the GSDS and the SDGs with scientific expertise (Federal Republic of Germany, 2016).   The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing Under the partnership, this prioritisation will involve nine SDGs (SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15), reflecting the importance of environmental protection and resilience as per the 2030 Agenda (UN, 2016). Environmental sustainability is one of four priority areas for North Macedonia. It involves SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. North Macedonia embarked on mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into its National Sustainable Development Plan in December 2015, with the aim of developing an SDG Plan 2016-2030, based on an assessment of needs and potential, as well as setting targets relevant to the national context (Spasenovska et al., 2017). The plan is under the overall responsibility of the vice-prime minister’s cabinet and aims to mainstream the 2030 Agenda at the national level. The government will also integrate SDG implementation into a four‐year government programme for the period of 2016‐2020 and harmonise it with the relevant sector strategies, plans and programmes (Wiederkehr et al., 2016).  A multi‐stakeholder process will be launched (including decision-makers and stakeholders at the national, regional and local level, as well as non-governmental stakeholders from academia, the private sector, donor agencies, NGOs, etc.), with the support of the UN Development Programme. The objective is to prioritise the SDGs, localise the targets, select local target indicators, develop a budgetary framework and review the relevant national sectoral strategies and the level of adjustment needed to align them with the SDG agenda (Wiederkehr et al., 2016). To lay the foundations for implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the government has undertaken a joint initiative with the UN to integrate the SDGs into the national planning process. This will start with the prioritisation of SDGs and the localisation of targets, as well as the selection of local indicators (Spasenovska et al., 2017). All resident UN agencies, together with the UNECE, will support North Macedonia to adapt the SDGs to local conditions and to establish a system for tracking progress. Similarly, all UN agencies will support its alignment with EU standards and legislation, including through peer-to-peer exchanges with EU Member States (UN, 2016).

Briefing Turkey’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 2, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. As regards SDGs with an environmental dimension, Turkey`s SDG actions focus primarily on preserving genetic resources and biodiversity (SDGs 2, 15); sustainable and climate-adapted agricultural production methods and technologies (SDG 2); ensuring sustainable water management which strikes a balance between nature conservation and resource development (SDG 6); energy efficiency in transport, buildings and industries (SDG 7); encouraging ‘zero waste’ at the industrial scale (SDGs 9, 12); promoting bioplastic and eco-labelling (SDG 9); raising awareness of consumers and producers on sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12); ensuring GHG emission control through new technologies (SDGs 9, 13); climate adaptation (SDG 13); preventing and reducing marine litter (SDG 14); maximizing the use of aquaculture resources in marine and inland waters, improving the protection of aquaculture stocks and aquaculture development (SDG 14); holistic planning and management of the terrestrial ecosystem, promoting high value-added forest ecosystems, developing holistic policies on gene, species, habitat, ecosystems, and scaling up the conservation and sustainable use of the terrestrial ecosystem (SDG 15) (Government of Turkey, 2019). Turkey was among the 22 countries that submitted their first VNR to the HLPF in 2016. The VNR process commenced with the highest-level political ownership on the Turkish president’s call to all government entities (Government of Turkey, 2016). Turkey`s second VNR, in 2019, focuses on progress towards the SDGs made between 2010-2018. The Presidency of Strategy and Budget, which is also responsible for preparing NDPs, is the national focal point for SDGs and coordinated the 2019 VNR preparations. The VNR process accelerated the steps to address policies from this perspective (Government of Turkey, 2019). Turkey established a National Sustainable Development Commission to lead the concerted action by all relevant institutions to achieve the SDGs. The country also focuses on engagement with non-governmental stakeholders and aims to make SDG action a shared responsibility among all relevant stakeholders (UN DESA, 2016). The Turkish Industry and Business Association, Independent Industrialists’ and Businessmen’s Association, Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation, Business Council for Sustainable Development Turkey and the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey were selected as the coordinating institutions to represent the  private sector. Civil society and all the relevant UN agencies are coordinated by the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office to the Republic of Turkey, while the Union of Municipalities of Turkey was appointed as the coordinating institution for local administrations. As a result, a total of 2 962 representatives from government entities, 312 NGOs, 2 000 companies and 50 municipalities were consulted directly on VNR preparations (UN DESA, 2019). Turkey submitted two VNRs to the UN in 2016 and 2019. Through the VNR process, the Turkish government developed an online ‘National SDG Best Practices Database’ which will be active throughout the period covering the 2030 Agenda. In the first phase, 400 practices were collected from public and private sectors, academia, NGOs and municipalities, and several of the best examples were included in the VNR (Government of Turkey, 2019). After the adoption of Agenda 2030, Turkey assigned the responsibility of tracking 218 indicators to relevant institutions. In 2019, the country published its SDG Indicators Set, comprising 83 indicators. While the ratio of indicators produced is higher for SDGs 3, 7, 9, further work is needed for indicators on SDGs 1, 2, 12, 13 and 14 indicators (Government of Turkey, 2019). The Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) follows up on the international process for determining the global SDG indicators. After the identification of the global SDG indicators list, in 2019, TURKSTAT issued an ‘SDG Indicators Newsletter, 2010-2017’. Turkey plans to prepare its National SDG Review Reports periodically, in line with the Agenda of the UN HLPF. TURKSTAT will take on the central role of tracking progress on Agenda 2030. The country is also working on promoting voluntary stocktaking processes for the private sector (UN DESA, 2016).  The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing Montenegro’s priority areas on SDGs with an environmental dimension lie in SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. In December 2015, the government of Montenegro adopted the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD) until 2030. The NSSD considered national circumstances and commitments while defining the strategic goals and measures on SDG action and aligning sectoral policies to the SDGs. The Strategy structured the strategic objectives into five priority themes, including preservation of natural capital (SDGs 14, 15); and the introduction of a green economy, governance, and finance for sustainable development (SDGs 7, 8, 9, 12) (Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism of Montenegro, 2016). By participating in international dialogue on the SDGs and Agenda 2030, Montenegro expressed its full commitment to the priority issues of sustainable development, such as: the introduction of a green economy, strengthening the efficiency of use natural resources (SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7); climate change (SDG 13); conservation of sensitive ecosystems and coastal areas (SDGs 14, 15); and sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12). Priority is also given to creating conditions to achieve progress on key determinants of sustainable development enshrined in the relevant EU policies, primarily the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism of Montenegro, 2016). Montenegro submitted a VNR to the UN in 2016. In addition to the SDG indicators developed by the UN, Montenegro’s NSSD 2030 includes selected national indicators, indicators of relevant international organisations and cumulative indicators from the programme activities of the UN Development Programme in Montenegro (Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism of Montenegro, 2016 The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing Acknowledging that further work remains to be done, especially in terms of maintaining healthy ecosystems and the sustainable management of natural resources, France will increase the funding for the French Development Agency (AFD) for sustainable development by EUR 4 billion by 2020, EUR 2 billion of which will be dedicated to climate change mitigation and adaptation (UN DESA, 2016). France`s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15.   France launched SDG action by designating an Interministerial Representative for Sustainable Development and General Commissioner for Sustainable Development, who led the preparation of the country’s first report on the SDGs. Subsequently, a national action plan was developed, underpinned by the following elements: a shared vision; government measures and public policy guidelines for sustainable development; assistance to economic players; and citizens’ ownership of the SDGs (Republic of France, 2016). France engaged stakeholders through an online public consultation on its national action plan to ensure citizen involvement. The country also set up a committee of international experts to act as a knowledge source for developing the plan (Republic of France, 2016). France submitted a VNR to the UN in 2016. The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) is responsible for the production and coordination of data with the statistical departments of the various French ministries. To produce national SDG indicators, the INSEE conducted a feasibility study involving all relevant ministries. The resulting list of 109 national SDG indicators was published in March 2017. The National Reform Programme, which reflects the goals of the 2030 Agenda ( ) is consistent with these indicators (INSEE, 2017). The process involves a government assessment report to be submitted to the parliament each October (Republic of France, 2016).   The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it! All official European Union website addresses are in the   domain. Briefing The Netherland`s action towards SDGs with environmental dimension primarily focuses on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. On SG 6, the Netherlands aims to establish fair, efficient and sustainable water supply and sanitation services. The Kingdom anticipates that the high quality of drinking water may come under pressure due to climate change or water contamination. To meet future challenges for drinking water and groundwater quality, over 30 parties have signed a declaration of intent to jointly improve water quality further (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). On SDG 7, the Netherlands has one of the lowest rates of renewable energy production in Europe. Thus, this SDG remains a challenge for the country. Measures and policies are being developed to find innovative ways to reduce industry’s energy use (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). As regards SDG 9, the Nether­lands is promoting sustainable innovation and investment, particularly green innovations, such as a bio-based, the circular economy and electric transport. For SDG 11, the Kingdom focuses on 12 priorities, including air quality, the circular economy, climate adaptation, energy transition, sustainable land use and nature-based solutions. On SDG 12, tackling food waste and hazardous waste are identified as priority areas. The Netherlands gives high importance to reducing GHG emissions and achieving climate change adaptation (SDG 13) (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). For SDG 14, the Kingdom is focusing on reducing marine pollution, toxic substances, marine litter and microplastics to acceptable levels as well as safeguarding marine biodiversity and achieving sustainable fisheries. On SDG 15, conservation, resto­ration and the sustainable management of nature still pose challenges. Thus, the government introduced additional measures, in particular to protect meadow birds and promote environmentally friendly agriculture (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017).   Although the Kingdom of the Nether­lands’ starting position is promising, it has also identified certain gaps in terms of SDG achievement. The most challenging areas of action point to the circular economy (SDG 12), climate action (SDG 13), low-carbon energy transition (SDG 7), sustainable food and agriculture (SDGs 2, 15), and sustainable fisheries (SDG 14) (PBI Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, 2016). The Netherlands consumes large quantities of fossil fuels and has high per-capita GHG emissions. The share of renewable energy in the total energy supply is low compared to other European countries. The quality of groundwater, surface water and coastal waters, fisheries, as well as natural habitats and biodiversity are under considerable pressure across the country. It promotes sustainable economic growth (SDG 8) by paying extra attention to climate change (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). In the Netherlands, responsibility for performing SDG action have been assigned to all the ministries concerned, coordinated by the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation which is the coordinating cabinet member for SDG action. An Interministerial Network of SDG Focal Points formulates and stimulates government action by proposing SDG-related strategies to the Council of Ministers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented its Action Plan in 2016, advising on national coordination on a permanent basis. In 2016, the government reported progress on the Action Plan to the parliament (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). The Netherlands has integrated tracking its SDG progress into the regular policy cycles. Every year, the government submits a report to the parliament, outlining national SDG progress. In May 2019, the third report (in Dutch) on SDG progress was presented to parliament via the regular budget and reporting cycle. Five umbrella organizations representing the private sector, knowledge institutions, NGOs, local governments, and youth each contributed a chapter to the reports. Since 2019, the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights has also contributed to the report on an annual basis.  The Netherlands submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017 and plans to present a second one in 2022-2023. The Netherlands believes that national and local governments, the private sector (including the financial sector), civil society organizations, knowledge institutions and young people are all key partners in implementing the SDGs (Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2017). Thus, the country works closely with stakeholders to promote SDG implementation in partnership. For example, the SDG Charter is a growing multi-stakeholder platform with over 500 Dutch companies, NGOs, knowledge institutions and philanthropists who have declared their intention to contribute to the SDGs in partnership. The SDG Community is an online community of active stakeholders across sectors where partners can create profiles and showcase their work on the SDGs. In September 2017, the Kingdom launched the first SDG Action Day, during which the stakeholders discussed the SDGs with Members of Parliament and opened the first Dutch SDG House in Amsterdam, creating a meeting point for SDG partners. This event also initiated the ‘Adopt an SDG campaign’ by the NGO-coalition Building Change in which 25 Members of Parliament declared their commitment to one or more SDGs.  Since 2019, the national assessment framework for new laws and policies has become ‘SDG-proof’, requiring law- and policymakers to assess the effects of their legislation on SDG progress. These adjustments will create more transparency on the contributions of new laws and policies to achieving the SDGs.  The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing Malta is currently revising its NSDS to incorporate the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. For this purpose, the Maltese government has been working on developing a national Vision 2050 which aims to provide guidelines towards long-term sustainable development in Malta, whilst integrating the 2030 Agenda into sustainable development policies across all levels of government. As part of its efforts to identify the steps needed for SDG action, the country launched the process of interministerial consultations (UNECE, 2016).  The aim is to have a long-term objective that integrates the 2030 Agenda while, at the same time, defining sustainable development guidelines based on maximising the three pillars of sustainable development across all levels of government. Malta’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. From a purely environmental perspective, this vision contemplates the development of a policy that is aimed at the following critical targets: fostering the sustainability of farming activities by adapting to the local geo-climatic conditions and organic farming (SDG 2); better managing the supply of improved water quality and ensuring an adequate supply of good-quality drinking water, treating wastewater and harvesting rainwater (SDG 6); reducing the country’s carbon footprint and GHG emissions through energy efficiency and replacing heavy fuel oil with natural gas and gas oil, and renewable sources (SDG 7); improving resource efficiency in production (SDG 8); promoting greener enterprises (SDG 9); promoting energy efficiency and green spaces in cities (SDG 11); sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources (SDG 12); climate action (SDG 13); marine litter, eutrophication, exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches, minimising and addressing the impacts of ocean acidification, maintaining fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels and marine protected areas (SDG 14); and supporting afforestation, as well as safeguarding ecosystems and biodiversity (SDG 15) (Government of Malta, 2018). Since 2013, the Ministry for the Environment, Sustainable Development and Climate Change (MESDC) has been mandated by the prime minister as the lead agency for sustainable development matters, as set out in Malta`s Sustainable Development Act. The Act provides for the establishment of three structures to promote the sustainable development agenda: 1) the competent authority, which is responsible for a number of functions, as defined by the Act (currently the MESDC); 2) the Guardian of Future Generations, which is entrusted with promoting sustainable development principles and safeguarding the interests of future generations; and 3) the Sustainable Development Network (UN DESA, 2018). Malta submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. The NSDS will be accompanied by an action plan which will outline the implementation timeline and structure of the sustainable development actions (Government of Malta, 2018). It will be the overarching umbrella for existing and future policy and strategy drafted by the Maltese government. Civil society, the private sector, academia and the public will be invited to provide feedback on the SDG actions at regular intervals (UNECE, 2016). SDG-related data collection and monitoring is managed jointly by the MESDC and the National Statistics Office (NSO) (Government of Malta, 2018).

Briefing The SDS is complemented by an action plan that lays out concrete actions and initiatives in nine target areas, including responsible consumption and production (SDG 12); urban development, mobility and infrastructure (SDGs 9, 11); energy and climate change (SDGs 7 and 13); as well as the protection of natural resources (SDGs 2, 6, 15) (Swiss Confederation, 2016). Switzerland’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15. The federal government’s other environmental goals include the conservation status of the populations of national priority species by 2020 and improved conditions in endangered habitats (SDG 15), the limited impact of waste and closing materials’ cycles (SDG 12) (Swiss Confederation, 2018). Switzerland’s VNRs recognise barriers and conflicts related to mainstreaming the economic, social and environmental dimensions of innovation, including ‘conflicts of use’ in environmental protection, human settlement, energy, and transport, as well as domestic policy spillovers. The 2018 VNR identified areas where additional efforts are needed to achieve the SDGs. For example,, Switzerland’s use of natural resources from within the country is declining but its use of natural resources from abroad is ‘increasing in an unsustainable way’, hindering the country’s progress on SDG 12 (Swiss Confederation, 2018). In Switzerland, the SDG action is pursued at the federal, regional, and communal level. Its 16 regional governments (cantons) and 234 municipalities are strongly involved in sustainable development policies and many have adopted their own strategies. High-level supervision on SDG action is provided by the Federal Council of Switzerland. The federal government intends to intensify dialogue with the cantons and communes and support them on  the 2030 Agenda, for example, through platforms for exchange and networks (Swiss Confederation, 2018). An Interdepartmental National 2030 Agenda Working Group was also created to coordinate national efforts and ensure that the SDGs are integrated within Switzerland’s institutions. It is co-led by the Federal Office for Spatial Development and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (Swiss Confederation, 2018). Switzerland works closely with civil society and the private sector to advance its SDG action. All  levels of government as well as the private sector, non-governmental organizations and the scientific community are engaged in the process at the federal, cantonal and communal level, according to relevant competencies, established division of tasks and the principle of subsidiarity. Many cantons and communities have defined sustainability and coordination mechanisms for sustainable development and engage in dialogue with the federal government on SDG action. An advisory group of non-state actors has identified priority challenges for the country and provides a platform for dialogue with the federal government on issues related to achieving the SDGs (Swiss Confederation, 2018). Switzerland submitted two VNRs to the UN in 2016 and in 2018. To track its progress towards the SDGs, Switzerland uses its sustainable development monitoring and reporting system (MONET) which has been in place since 2003. In May 2016, MONET’s reference framework was realigned with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. The system was expanded to enable the continuous monitoring of progress towards the goals and is currently tracking 85 SDG indicators. Federal offices are required to address sustainable development in their periodic reports on items of business or areas covered by their sectoral policies. Switzerland plans to publish a report on progress towards achieving the SDGs every four years, as from 2018. It will also draft a report in partnership with the cantons, communes and non-governmental actors which will be released to the public at the same time (Swiss Confederation, 2017b).

Briefing In general, Finland sees the need to transform today’s linear economies into circular economies, where virgin materials are used sparingly, and recycling and reuse are the norm (SDG 12). A circular economy is viewed as a solution to job creation and environmental protection. Therefore, the country aims to transform its energy systems and develop ways to account for the environmental costs of economic activities (SDG 7) (Pokka, 2017). Finland held the chairmanship of the Arctic Council during 2017-2019. As the Arctic is warming twice as rapidly as the globe, it has called for urgent measures to achieve the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement and SDG 13 (Pokka, 2017). Finland’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus on SDGs 2, 7, 12, 13, 14 and 15.   According to the SDSN SDG Index and Dashboard 2019 and the analysis conducted in the context of Finland’s sustainable development policy evaluation (PATH2030), the greatest long-term challenges in Finland arise from high levels of consumption of materials (SDG 12) and energy (SDG 7). Key themes that should be addressed by sustainability-oriented policies include the energy system (SDG 7), forest use (SDG 15), aquatic ecosystems (SDG 14) and food systems (SDG 2) (Berg et al., 2019; Finnish Environment Institute, 2020). Thus, the Finnish government has focused on two themes for SDG action; a ‘carbon-neutral and resource-wise Finland’ and a ‘non-discriminating, equal and competent Finland’, which cover all SDGs in an integrated manner (Prime Minister`s Office, 2020). The Finnish parliament first discussed the 2030 Agenda and the parliament’s role in December 2016 and since then has received the government’s yearly progress reports and has made recommendations to the government. The Committee for the Future is responsible for the 2030 Agenda in the Finnish parliament. (Prime Minister’s Office Finland, 2016). Finland submitted two VNRs to the UN in 2016 and 2020. The latest strategy for sustainable development ‘Finland We Want, 2050’ was adopted in December 2013 and updated in April 2016 in line with the 2030 Agenda. It has eight aspirational objectives. In addition to the strategy, in February 2017, the government adopted its Implementation Plan for the 2030 Agenda. Sustainable development has also been integrated into the state budget since 2018. Special focus has been on budgetary allocations to measures supporting carbon neutrality and resource wisdom (Prime Minister`s Office Finland, 2020). The Finnish national network for the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda was launched in October 2016. The network is composed of members from various ministries, research institutions and other stakeholder organisations. It has defined a national follow-up and review mechanisms for Finland, including around 50 national sustainable development indicators. An interactive and participatory online follow-up mechanism enables multi-stakeholder discussions on the progress made, and on gaps and prospects for future development. This mechanism is an opportunity to bring sustainable-development-related data, trends and challenges into wider public debate and knowledge (Prime Minister`s Office Finland, 2016). Finland has a long tradition of engaging the civil society and other stakeholders in its sustainable development work. The key mechanism on SDG action has been the multi-stakeholder National Commission for Sustainable Development. A multidisciplinary Expert Panel for Sustainable Development, comprising 10 eminent scientists and professors, and the Agenda 2030 Youth Group of 20 young sustainable development ambassadors have challenged and supported the work of the government and the National Commission. The national Citizens’ Panel for Sustainable Development, composed of 500 ordinary citizens from all walks of life, was first established in 2018 and renewed in 2019 through a public call. Each panellist was tasked with assessing the current state and recent development of sustainable development in Finland by using an online assessment tool. The assessment was made individually for each of Finland’s 50 national sustainable development indicators, based on indicator data, specific expert analyses, and citizens’ comments on indicators and analysis (Prime Minister`s Office Finland, 2020). Commitment205.fi — an online tool — is one of the most important instruments in Finland for boosting participation in and concrete action on sustainable development. There are currently over 2 000 operational measurable commitments from all spheres of society. A sustainable lifestyle service for citizens enables Finns to pursue a more sustainable everyday life. With the renewed service, users can first calculate their personal carbon footprint and then draw up a personal plan to reduce it by choosing suitable actions from a selection of recommended smart choices. Every individual plan contributes to the national emissions reduction target (Prime Minister`s Office Finland, 2016). Finland provides regular national reports on its progress towards achieving the SDGs. An external independent evaluation was published in March 2019 to assess the national implementation of the 2030 Agenda, both in domestic and international policies (Berg et al., 2019). Finland recognises one of the top barriers to progress on SDGs with an environmental dimension as the gap between current action and the need for radical transformation. It acknowledges that although some measures have been taken, they have not been ambitious enough. For example, an analysis of the Finnish state budget has shown that those budgetary items which are counterproductive to carbon neutrality and resource wisdom still account for almost double the amount that is conducive to SDG action. The country acknowledges that the use of indicators to track progress is insufficient because many spillover effects are still unknown as they are difficult to measure based on indicators. Another barrier for the country has been the conflict of interest between different stakeholders, especially between economic and environmental objectives, and insufficiency in the systematic use of indicators and research data in decision-making and societal learning. The enabling factors included long-term national work on environmental and nature protection through legislation, economic instruments, voluntary measures, and environmental institutions and governance. Sustainable development is a widely shared and mainstreamed aim in Finland and nature is a highly valued ecosystem service, including the public’s right of access to it. International environmental agreements and EU legislation also provide a solid and binding framework for national policies and measures. For further progress, Finland aims to create more knowledge on the externalities of its consumption and production to better understand and measure the environmental impact (footprint and handprint) in other countries.

Briefing Under the inclusive and sustainable development priority, Estonia set out to rethink production and consumption processes in an eco-innovative manner (SDG 12). The country prioritises circular use as well as smart and innovative solutions that sustain the environment (SDGs 7, 9). Readily available information about chemicals in products is considered necessary to phase out hazardous substances and reduce the negative impact on health and the environment, as well as the planned recycling of the material (SDGs 3, 7) (Lõhmus, 2017). Estonia’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 9, 12, 13 and 15.    In the first half of 2018, Estonia held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Ahead of this, it set out priorities based on four themes, two of which are related to environment: a ‘safe and secure environment’ and ‘inclusive and sustainable development’ (Republic of Estonia, 2016). To ensure coordination among the relevant line ministries, the country established an Interministerial Sustainable Development Working Group which works on an ad hoc basis and is composed of representatives from each ministry and Statistics Estonia. Estonia tracks progress on SDG actions through a set of sustainable development indicators which are regularly reviewed. According to Statistics Estonia, of the 231 global SDG indicators, 32 are currently measurable by Estonia´s national sustainable development indicators. Gathering information on the remaining indicators requires further effort and the development of a set of national SDG indicators (Republic of Estonia, 2016). Estonia submitted two VNRs to the UN in 2016 and 2020. A gap analysis, a mapping exercise and indicator-based analyses indicate that Estonia is successful in several SDGs, including SDG 7, by achieving a high proportion of renewable energy in overall energy consumption, and SDG 15, thanks to rich biodiversity protection. The analyses also show that Estonia`s main challenges lie in developing an energy- and resource-efficient economy and reducing carbon dioxide emissions per capita, which require continued efforts toward SDG action in those areas (UN DESA, 2020).   The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing The government adopted Sweden’s Action Plan for the 2030 Agenda with the intention of reinforcing efforts to achieve the SDGs and indicating how government agencies and other actors in society can contribute (Kingdom of Sweden, 2017). The Action Plan includes key political measures for the years 2018-2020. It also highlights six cross-sectoral focus areas, including a socially beneficial, circular, and bio-based economy; corporate social responsibility; a sustainable and healthy food chain; and knowledge and innovation (Government Offices of Sweden, 2018). Sweden’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus on SDGs 2, 3, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.  Sweden’s environmental objectives have been decided by the Riksdag and constitute the national objectives that contribute to attaining the environmental dimension of the SDGs. At the same time, Agenda 2030 can also revitalise and provide new conditions to catalyse the achievement of the country’s environmental objectives (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, 2020). The Swedish parliament has approved several of the government’s communications and bills that have a bearing on the 2030 Agenda. All ministries produced action plans which provided the basis for the 2016 Government Communication on the Sustainable Development Goals (Kingdom of Sweden, 2017a). In 2015, the government established the Scientific Council for Sustainable Development tasked with serving as a platform for dialogue between the government and the scientific community and helping to provide a sustainable development policy with a scientific basis (Kingdom of Sweden, 2017a). In addition, Sweden’s budget proposal for 2018 indicated the contribution of fiscal policy to sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda is mentioned in the financial plan and in most of the 27 spending areas, showing an almost two-fold increase in areas compared to the 2017 budget (Kingdom of Sweden, 2017b). Sweden submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. In 2017, the Swedish VNR identified several challenges, such as establishing sustainable energy (SDG 7); and climate resilient pathways (SDG 13); achieving the targets for sustainable seas and marine resources (SDG 14); and the transition towards sustainable consumption and production processes (SDG 12) (Kingdom of Sweden, 2017a). The latest in-depth evaluation of the environmental quality objectives/EQOs performed by the Swedish EPA (2019) emphasises that there is a negative trend in ecosystem recovery and biodiversity conservation (SDG 15). GHG emissions must be reduced at a faster rate, the ecological links in the landscape need to be strengthened, and the dispersion of dangerous/hazardous substances must be reduced. In 2018, Statistics Sweden was tasked by the government with setting up a national monitoring system by coordinating the development and production of statistics on Sweden’s implementation of the 2030 Agenda and making these statistics available (Government Offices of Sweden, 2018). In October 2019, Statistics Sweden carried out a statistical follow-up of the SDG actions, which includes proposals on the timing of national statistical reviews, on national indicators and on developing some statistical measures (Government Offices of Sweden, 2018).    The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing Lithuania has identified combatting climate change (SDG 13), protecting oceans (SDG 14) and water resources (SDG 6), ecosystems and biodiversity (SDG 15), reducing pollution and waste (SDGs 3 and 11), and increasing resource efficiency (SDG 7) as its key priority areas for environmental sustainability (Treciokas, 2016). Lithuania’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15. The country considers climate change (SDG 13) a major threat to sustainable development. Its climate change mitigation policy is based on the sustainable development of energy from renewable resources and energy efficiency (SDG 7). In 2016, the country announced that its energy production from renewable sources accounted for more than half of the total electricity and heat production (Trečiokas, 2016). In October 2013, Lithuania approved the priorities for research and experimental development and innovation, with a breakthrough expected in 2022. The priorities cover the areas of energy, agri-innovation, biotechnology, transport, information and communication technology, new production processes and a creative society (Government of Lithuania, 2018). Lithuania prioritises the sustainable development of cities and communities (SDG 11). It is currently developing a new general territory plan that will integrate the SDGs. This plan will become the key instrument for ensuring inclusive and sustainable urban development, reducing the socio-economic exclusion of cities and the negative impact of built-up territories on the environment, and securing the protection of natural and cultural heritage (Government of Lithuania, 2018). The Ministry of Environment is the focal point for progressing towards the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD) and the 2030 Agenda. An Interinstitutional Working Group on Sustainable Development was established by the ministry, bringing together experts from various line ministries and civil society organisations. This Group, in cooperation with other national authorities, supports the Ministry of Environment in preparing NSSD progress reviews for presentation to the National Commission on Sustainable Development (NCSD). The NCSD is chaired by the prime minister and includes representatives from line ministries, as well as civil society, academia and the private sector (Government of Lithuania, 2018; Statistics Lithuania (LS), 2017a). There is also a commitment to further strengthen dialogue with the private sector and local stakeholders to achieve policy coherence at all levels. The Association of Local Authorities in Lithuania (ALAL) is involved in the national adaptation of the 2030 Agenda. Civil society and the private sector are represented in both the NCSD and the Interinstitutional Working Group on Sustainable Development (Government of Lithuania, 2018). Lithuania aims to align its sectoral strategies with the SDGs and has begun to assess the coherence of its NSSD with the 2030 Agenda. After the assessment, a public discussion will take place between the relevant institutions and non-governmental stakeholders to identify the priority areas and relevant SDG targets (UNECE, 2016). The NSSD is operationalised through four-year government action programmes, the current programme covering the period 2017-2020. A 2016-2017 mapping of the SDGs showed very close alignment between the 2030 Agenda and the NSSD. In addition, Lithuania will update its National Progress Strategy Lithuania 2030 to better reflect the SDGs (Government of Lithuania, 2018).  Lithuania submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. LS collects national data indicators related to sustainable development. A dedicated working group was established to analyse the official SDG indicators and map their correlation with nationally available data (LS, 2017a). Lithuania’s NSSD identified a set of 84 national sustainable development indicators. LS then updated this list in August 2017, in cooperation with other ministries and institutions. The national list of SDG indicators will be updated annually (LS, 2017b). In addition, the biennial NSSD reports will analyse the sustainable development data and provide relevant policy recommendations (UNECE, 2016) The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing Denmark initiated its SDG implementation by setting up an Interministerial Group on Sustainable Development to ensure coordination among all relevant institutions and stakeholders. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for coordinating the national implementation of the SDGs, while line ministries are responsible for designing policies that address the SDGs, as appropriate. The Ministry of Finance is also responsible for EU follow-up to maintain a holistic approach and create linkages to the national follow-up, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for the SDGs in the context of the UN and other international forums. Both Ministries coordinate their efforts closely (Danish Government, 2017). Denmark’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses on SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15.   The government recognises the importance of making the SDGs concrete and actionable. In 2017, the country adopted its Action Plan on the implementation and follow up of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. The Plan is centred on the 5ps: prosperity, people, planet, peace and partnerships and was formulated according to the need to adapt SDG targets to national circumstances. It reflects the government’s ambition to prioritise SDG actions (Danish Government, 2017). Under the ‘planet’ cluster, Denmark considers itself as a front-runner in the transition to a green economy (SDG8), sustainable use of natural resources and energy efficiency (SDG 7). The government is dedicated to continuing an ambitious and efficient green transition while, at the same time, ensuring jobs and competitiveness (SDG 8). It acknowledges the need to further reduce GHG emissions (SDG 13). Denmark also aims to continue to prevent and limit the spread of contaminating agents that are harmful to human health (SDG 3), and to maintain a strong agriculture and food industry (SDG 2) that continues to focus on sustainability and resource efficiency (SDG 15). Having a rich biodiversity, Denmark aims to promote opportunities to enjoy nature, to prioritise the protection of marine life (SDG 14) and to stop the regression of biological diversity (SDG 15). In this context, the government has set out 10 concrete national targets on biological diversity; the protection of the marine environment; preventing and limiting contamination with harmful agents; sustainable cities; the circular economy; sustainable companies and products; sustainable food; a reduction in GHG emissions; and renewable energy (Danish Government, 2017). Denmark submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. Denmark has also selected water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), a green economy, green growth, and resource efficiency (SDG 12) as its priority areas for sustainable development (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2017). The government is working on legislative proposals on the SDGs and plans to establish an SDG fund on external action. Denmark also recognises the need for all civil society actors to contribute to achieving the SDGs (Danish Government, 2017). The Danish Action Plan is complemented by 37 national targets and measurable, quantifiable national SDG indicators. The Interministerial Group on Sustainable Development explores possible modalities and constraints in the national follow-up and reporting mechanisms (Danish Government, 2017). Since 2018, Denmark has produced an annual progress report on the Action Plan and its 37 national targets. This report gives a summary of SDG implementation and identifies the necessary adjustments to the existing implementation plans. The progress report is publicly available and is submitted to the Danish Parliament. In addition, the government will present a status report every four years. This status report will include the same elements as the progress report but may also may contain information on existing and potential initiatives to achieve the SDGs (Danish Government, 2017).    The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing The priorities for SDG action, in this respect, are to reduce the negative environmental impact of cities (SDG 11); to pay particular attention to air quality (SDG 3); and waste management (SDG 12); to become resilient to the negative effects of disasters (SDG 13); and to protect cultural and natural heritage (SDG 15)(Government of Spain, 2018). Spain prioritizes actions towards SDGs 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 with an environmental dimension. Spain also supports initiatives relating to sustainable energy (SDG 7) and focuses on efficient and sustainable water management (SDG 6) (FCAS) (UN DESA, 2017). The country’s other environmental priorities are the fight against desertification and protection of forests (SDG 15) as well as the sustainable management of marine resources and oceans (SDG 14) (Government of Spain, 2018). It developed a National Action Plan for 2018-2020 for action towards Agenda 2030. The plan prioritizes certain aspects of the 2030 Agenda. The High-Level Group (HLG) for the 2030 Agenda leads the coordination of all SDG-related issues in Spain with representatives from line ministries. Spain created the Office of High Commissioner for the 2030 Agenda to oversee progress on sustainable development. The high commissioner reports directly to the president and receives technical support from the Office of the High Commissioner for the 2030 Agenda (Government of Spain, 2018). Spain submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. Civil society is actively involved in SDG actions, with representatives from the municipalities and regions forming part of the HLG.

Briefing Liechtenstein`s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15. The Liechtenstein government is committed to an environmentally friendly approach to agriculture, as climate change is likely to pose the greatest risk to Liechtenstein’s agricultural sector. Liechtenstein has committed to reducing its carbon emissions to 40 % compared to 1990 levels (SDG 13). It recognises that an active climate policy can create the right incentives for the development and use of climate-friendly, sustainable and innovative technologies (Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, 2019).  Access to clean, modern and affordable energy is a priority for Liechtenstein (SDG 8) and a 2050 Energy Vision is currently being drawn up to achieve this goal. The government has also created stronger incentives for more efficient and less environmentally harmful resource management. Environmental taxes have increased and appear to have had some effect on consumption and production patterns (SDG 12) (Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, 2019). The country is committed to global environmental protection and nature conservation and participates in close regional cooperation within Europe. Measures on the conservation of biodiversity (SDG 15) have either been implemented or are planned for the future. In 2017, the country launched ‘Waterfootprint Liechtenstein’, the rationale of which is ‘drink tap water; donate drinking water’ (SDG 6). The project aims to provide access to high-quality water for every resident of the Principality of Liechtenstein — i.e. to improve the living conditions of around 38 000 people in need. To date, a total of 22 009 ‘water footprints’ have been activated in Liechtenstein (Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, 2019). The government established an Interdisciplinary Working Group led by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Justice and Culture. The Group is tasked with performing a gap analysis of the level of SDG action to ensure implementation and reviewing the availability of data for tracking progress (UN HLPF, 2019). The government also decided to define the SDGs together with the 2017-2021 Government Programme as one of the strategic guidelines for its work. It aims to ensure SDG action is as broad as possible (Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, 2019). Liechtenstein submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. The National Statistical Office (Amt für Statistik) maintains a national indicator system for sustainable development comprising a total of 55 indicators; it is published annually. Currently, the system is not based directly on the SDGs (Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, 2019).

Briefing In this context, it has defined priority areas, including raising awareness of all aspects of the transition and a comprehensive approach to reducing GHG emissions (SDG 13); the use of renewable energy sources (SDG 7); and the development of sustainable mobility (SDG 9) (Government of Republic of Slovenia, 2020).  Slovenia`s priority areas in SDGs with an environmental dimension are SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.  Statistics place Slovenia below the EU average when it comes to three types of productivity — material, energy and emissions — as well as monitoring circularity in the use of resources (EU + the UK: 11.7, Slovenia: 8.5 – in 2017). In the long run, this makes Slovenia vulnerable because of its dependency on imported raw materials. Therefore, one of its four priority areas is the transition to a low-carbon economy (Government of Republic of Slovenia, 2020). In cooperation with the European Institutes of Innovation and Technology (EIT Climate-KIC and EIT Raw Materials) and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), Slovenia has prepared a comprehensive programme for its transition to a carbon-free society, which represents a model example at the EU level. The connection between transitioning to a circular economy and achieving climate neutrality is partly included in the National Energy and Climate Plan of the Republic of Slovenia and will also play an important role in developing new strategies for industrial climate neutrality and amending the Smart Specialization Strategy. Slovenia also considers SDG 14 as a priority area on preserving the biodiversity of land, marine and inland aquatic ecosystems. Its Spatial Development Strategy of Slovenia until 2050 puts the spotlight on the new role of cities, including green city systems and sustainable mobility systems and a healthy urban life (SDG 11) (Government of Republic of Slovenia, 2020). The Slovenian Development Strategy 2030 is the country’s umbrella development framework proposing a high quality of life for all. Slovenia incorporated the SDGs into its Development Strategy 2030 with the active participation of relevant stakeholders and vulnerable groups from local, regional and national bodies, civil society and businesses. The country’s National Development Strategy 2030 aims to strike a balance between a resilient, inclusive, and responsible society, economic growth that is inclusive and green, and a well-preserved natural environment (Government of Slovenia, 2017). Slovenia submitted two VNRs to the UN in 2017 and 2020. Slovenia established an Interdepartmental Working Group for Development Policies, which aims to link existing capacity on sustainable development and ensure horizontally integrated interdepartmental cooperation between ministries, government institutions and other key agencies (Government Office for Development and European Cohesion Policy, 2017).  The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing The Czech Republic 2030 strategic framework organises national SDG action into six national priority areas: social (people and society), economic (economy) and environmental (resilient ecosystems). ‘Resilient Ecosystems’ prioritises SDGs 6, 13, 14 and 15. Besides the goals for the planet, SDGs 2, 11, 12 are also addressed in this key area. For SDG 7, Czechia points to an increase in the use of renewable energy and recognises the need to improve its energy efficiency in consumption and production processes (Office of the Government of the Czech Republic, 2017). Czechia’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.   The government office’s Sustainable Development Department is designated to lead the SDG actions. Furthermore, the Government Council for Sustainable Development, chaired by the prime minister, serves as a coordination body to ensure that all key ministries, institutions and stakeholders are involved and informed about the process (Office of the Government of the Czech Republic, 2017). Czechia submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. Czechia has 97 national SDG targets and 192 indicators designed to achieve the 2030 Agenda. The compatibility of national strategies with the SDGs is measured through the regularly updated national database of strategies, which is an online platform. In addition, the compliance of sectoral and regional strategic documents, programmes and measures with the 2030 Agenda will be monitored by the Sustainable Development Department ever two years, in the form of analytical reports (Office of the Government of the Czech Republic, 2017).

Briefing With regard to an innovative and eco-efficient economy, it aims to preserve biological diversity, together with the services of eco-systems and renewable energy resources (SDG 7) used in innovative ways. As regards nature as its future capital, Latvia prioritises the use of location as capital, together with creating its image as a green country (Cross-Sectoral Coordination Centre - CSCC, 2018).  Latvia’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 7, 8, 9, 14 and 15. In Latvia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Consultative Council for Cooperation on Development are responsible for sustainable development cooperation and planning. Regular Council meetings constitute the main platform for implementation of the 2030 Agenda (CSCC, 2018). The CSCC is the primary body for development planning in Latvia and the focal point for the SDGs. It is overseen by the prime minister (CSCC, 2018) and includes representatives from all line ministries, the Latvian Platform for Development Cooperation (LAPAS), the Latvian Association of Local and Regional Governments, the Latvian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Employers’ Confederation of Latvia, the Latvian Rectors’ Council, the European Affairs Committee of the Latvian Parliament, the State Chancellery, and the Latvian School of Public Administration. There are plans to strengthen the Council, expand its membership, and establish new working groups, as appropriate (UNECE, 2016). The CSCC created an informal advisory working group for the SDGs, comprising representatives from relevant line ministries, local governments, civil society associations, international partners, and other relevant stakeholders. In Latvia, planning and policy are decentralised, which means that local authorities are critical to SDG actions. All local governments in Latvia have adopted sustainable development strategies which identify key issues, goals and plans. Many efforts at the local level are organised by the Latvian Association of Local and Regional Governments. The largest NGO umbrella organisation in Latvia is Alliance-Latvia which brings together organisations working on implementing the SDGs (CSCC, 2018). Latvia submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018). The Latvian National Development Plan 2014-2020 (NDP2020) is the overarching planning document for SDG action. The NDP2020 is supported by several policy frameworks and plans that set out how to achieve the SDGs (CSCC, 2018). In 2017, Latvia launched a public discussion on tracking progress towards the NDP2020 to promote the development and engagement of non-profits and civil society (Pārresoru koordinācijas centrs (PKC, 2017). The Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) oversees the gathering and publication of national data indicators. It estimates that data are available for approximately 37 % of the SDG indicators. In the first half of 2017, a full SDG mapping was conducted, in collaboration with the CSCC (CSCC, 2018).

Briefing To achieve the SDGs, Cyprus is giving specific attention and support to certain priority areas, including the promotion of green development and the creation of green jobs (SDG 8). Investing in waste management and recycling (SDG 12), reducing GHG emissions and adaptation to climate change (SDG 13) are the other priorities. As regards SDGs with an environmental dimension, the country focuses primarily on good health and well-being (SDG 3); affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); decent work and economic growth (SDG 8); industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9); and life below water (SDG 14) (Republic of Cyprus, 2017). In addressing SDGs with an environmental dimension, Cyprus focuses primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14.   Cyprus assigned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to coordinate relevant line ministries and other governmental institutions (e.g. the Statistical Service of Cyprus) to oversee the alignment of future national strategies with the 2030 Agenda. The Directorate General for European Programmes, Coordination and Development engages with the private sector, in cooperation with many other stakeholders (Republic of Cyprus, 2017). The country established an Interministerial Committee to prepare a strategic policy framework on the applicability of the SDGs in Cyprus. The Committee investigated possible interlinkages with existing initiatives and identified national priorities within the 2030 Agenda. Cyprus now has implementation plans in place for most of the SDGs (UNECE, 2016). To reinforce cooperation among all stakeholders, Cyprus conducted a nationwide online survey on SDG priorities. An extensive public information campaign will follow in the coming years (UNECE, 2016). Cyprus notes the importance of engaging with local authorities to create ownership of and involvement in the 2030 Agenda. Further activities are planned in all areas of cooperation, including engagement with local authorities in implementing the 2030 Agenda (Republic of Cyprus, 2017). Cyprus submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. The Statistical Service of Cyprus identified a maximum of five to six indicators for each SDG, which are primarily in line with the selected EU SDG indicators. The final set of national SDG indicators is yet to be agreed but will eventually enable Cyprus to monitor progress towards the SDGs, through national progress reports (Republic of Cyprus, 2017).

Briefing The Slovak Republic`s national SDG priorities include SDGs 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15 with an environmental dimension. The Slovak Republic is taking an approach supported by the whole government to implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The country has set up a Council for Sustainable Development and plans to revise its previous National Strategy on Sustainable Development and create new legislation, if necessary, to ensure SDG action (UNECE, 2016). The Council is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister for Investments and Informatization. It includes representatives of line ministries and government institutions at the national and regional level, civil society, the private sector, academia and other relevant bodies. It is supported by the Working Group for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and preparation of the National Investment Plan of the Slovak Republic for the years 2018-2030 (Deputy Prime Minister’s Office for Investments and Informatization of the Slovak Republic, 2018 ). The country is committed to integrating the 2030 Agenda into all public policies, including at the local level. The government promotes voluntary engagement, for instance, by creating a micro-grant scheme to support sustainable development projects for local communities (Deputy Prime Minister’s Office for Investments and Informatization of the Slovak Republic, 2018). The Slovak Republic encourages businesses to engage with sustainable development principles — for example, by creating a new SDG-specific category of the Via Bona Slovakia Award for responsible businesses (UN DESA, 2018). In 2017, the Slovak Republic adopted a roadmap for SDG action, which serves as the basis for a new NDS and overarching policy framework. The Slovak Republic Government Office, together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Affairs, has been tasked with developing the concept for the 2030 Agenda and ensuring that its ongoing implementation is a shared responsibility among all stakeholders (Slovak Republic, 2017a). The Slovak Republic submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. Whilst the Slovak Republic Statistical Office is responsible for the production of national sustainable development indicators, which are in line with the global UN and EU SDG indicators (Slovak Republic, 2017a; 2017b), the Government Council of the Slovak Republic for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is responsible for tracking SDG progress (UN DESA, 2018).

However, concrete actions remain rather limited.   Citizens take part in planning and implementing environmental SDGs in different ways, such as public participation in the development of environmental strategies, plans and programmes. In addition, NGOs are involved in the work of the NCSD, whilst non-governmental organizations and donors are active in implementing sustainable development projects.   Key challenges regarding SDG actions with an environmental dimension in Kosovo are the lack of specific strategies and programmes as well as a lack of finance and institutional capacities.

Briefing Croatia also aims to implement measures to prevent water pollution (SDGs 6, 14) and to shut down landfill by 2024 by phasing in modern waste-treatment facilities (SDG 12). The country will also invest EUR 4 to 6 billion in renewable energy (SDG 7) by 2030 (Government of the Republic of Croatia, 2019). Croatia’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15.   According to an EEA report, Croatia is one of three countries with the highest cumulative share of damage to GDP from extreme weather and climate events. It has therefore recognised the need to take a strategic approach to climate change adaptation (SDG 13) and to develop innovative solutions (SDG 9) for sustainable development. This awareness saw Croatia develop its first climate change adaptation strategy (Government of the Republic of Croatia, 2019). Since sustainable tourism is vital, Croatia is prioritising preservation of the natural environment (SDG 15) to ensure long-term sustainable growth. In recent years, marine tourism has become a fast-growing sector and the Croatian government has focused on regulating the maritime sector to ensure the highest environmental and maritime safety standards (SDG 14) (Kostelac, 2017). Safe and environmentally sustainable maritime transport, infrastructure and the maritime domain is another strategic goal (UN DESA, 2018). Croatia also plans to transition towards the use of alternative fuels for transport connections to its islands, thereby contributing to the reduction of emissions from marine transport (SDG 13) (Kostelac, 2017). Croatia designated the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs as its national coordinator for SDG actions. The Ministry established a working group on SDGs, followed by an ‘Environment Action Plan 2016-2024’ in line with the goals of the environmental SDGs. In May 2016, Croatia launched a project to develop its national climate adaptation strategy (ESDN, 2017). The government is receiving increasing levels of interest and cooperation from its major national stakeholder groups towards achieving the 2030 Agenda (Kostelac, 2017). Croatia submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. In early 2019, Croatia established the Information System for Strategic Planning and Development Management to effectively track the progress on SDG actions. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics designed an internet portal (modelled on the UN portal Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform) to share results and the status of SDG key indicators with the wider public (Government of the Republic of Croatia, 2019).

Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it! All official European Union website addresses are in the   domain. Briefing Achieving the SDGs in Serbia is indivisible from the process of its accession to the EU. Set out in the National Plan for Adoption of the EU Acquis from 2018 to 2021, special attention is paid to harmonization with the EU acquis, international standards, and implementation of agreements on six priority areas, including agriculture, environmental protection and climate change as well as  energy and industry (Republic of Serbia, 2019).  Serbia’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses mainly on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15. According to a public survey, many young people in Serbia (80 %) believe that environmental protection should be among the government’s key priorities. In discussions and the overall prioritization process of the EU Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) 2019 and 2020 programming, the key areas identified for support in the coming years are environmental protection and climate change. Furthermore, there is a special focus on continuing the investments in infrastructure for processing waste as well as those in the reconstruction and modernization of public facilities as part of efforts to improve energy efficiency (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 9, 12 and 13). In addition, Serbia considers the preservation of biodiversity (SDG 15)  as the most important SDG with an environmental dimension as it poses an obligation towards both the present and future generations. The country also recognizes that circular economy plays a major role in supporting SDG action, particularly on SDGs 9, 11, 12 and 13 (Republic of Serbia, 2019). At the local level, due to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, emergency management and local resilience to natural disaster risk reduction are becoming a priority among the local communities (SDGs 11, 13). A possible mechanism for achieving greater sustainability in cities is ‘local green councils’ to assist in decision-makers in respect of local acts affecting environmental protection (Republic of Serbia, 2019). Serbia submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. Serbia established an Interministerial Working Group with representatives from the relevant ministries and tasked with proposing guidelines and measures for achieving the 2030 Agenda (UNECE, 2016).  The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it! All official European Union website addresses are in the   domain. Briefing For ‘planet’, the country has prioritized SDGs 2, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, with three themes and 17 national strategic goals (UN DESA, 2017). The strategic goals include halting the loss of biodiversity (SDGs 2, 6, 12, 14 and 15) by safeguarding the conservation status of species and habitats in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; halting the spread of invasive alien species; increasing terrestrial and maritime protected areas and ensuring their effective management; protecting and restoring genetic resources and natural ecosystems linked to farming, forestry and aquaculture; and mainstreaming natural capital accounting in planning, programming and national accounting (Ministry for the Environment Land and Sea - IMELS, 2017). Italy’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension prioritize SDGs 2, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Italy’s strategic goal to ensure the sustainable management of natural resources (SDG 6, 11, 12, 13 and 15) includes providing biologically diverse and dynamic seas and preventing impacts on maritime and coastal environments; halting soil consumption and combatting desertification; minimizing pollutant loads in soils, water bodies and aquifers; considering the good ecological status of natural systems; implementing integrated water-resource management at all levels; maximizing water efficiency and adjusting withdrawals to water scarcity, minimizing emissions and reducing concentrations of air pollutants; and ensuring sustainable forest management and combatting forest abandonment and degradation (IMELS, 2017).   To create resilient communities and territories, protect landscapes and cultural heritage (SDGs 2, 6, 9, 11, 13 and 15), the country aims to prevent anthropogenic and environmental risk and strengthen urban and territorial resilience; to guarantee high environmental performances of buildings, infrastructures and open spaces; to boost urban regeneration; ensure sustainable urban accessibility and mobility; to ensure ecosystem restoration and defragmentation; strengthen ecological urban-rural connections, as well as developing their potential; and the sustainable management of territories, landscapes and cultural heritage (IMELS).   Italy started to align its development policies to the 2030 Agenda by preparing a harmonious ‘National Sustainable Development Strategy 2017-2030’ (NSDS). The NSDS was approved by the Council of Ministers in October 2017 and adopted by the Interministerial Committee for Economic Programming (CIPE) in late December of the same year (IMELS, 2017a) (CIPE, 2017). Preparation of a specific action plan is ongoing.   The International Development Cooperation (Agenzia Italiana per la Cooperazione allo Sviluppo, AICS) adopted the content and structure of the 2030 Agenda as an activity framework, as confirmed in the ‘Three-Year Programming and Policy Planning Document 2017-2019’ (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, 2018).   Italy has put civil society engagement and consultation with public/private institutions at the core of its NSDS process, with more than 200 NGOs involved in reflecting the vision of the 2030 Agenda in the NSDS (IMELS, 2017). The IMELS established a Sustainable Development Forum which involves civil society, local authorities and experts on the various themes related to progress towards the NSDS (IMELS, 2017b). The Forum’s activities started in December 2019. In addition, the Italian Alliance for Sustainable Development (Alleanza Italiana per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile, ASviS), established in 2016, brings together a large number of civil society institutions and networks, universities and research institutions to raise awareness and mobilize Italian society in order to implement the Agenda 2030 and to achieve the SDGs; it regularly reports on them (IMELS, 2017). Italy submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. In May 2019, the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) and the Regional and Provincial Environmental Agencies Network launched the Agenda 2030 Task Force which aims to coordinate and harmonize their activities related to supporting regional and provincial strategies. In June 2019, the Italian Council of Ministers Presidency established a coordination body — Cabina di regia ‘Benessere Italia’ — to strengthen and coordinate policies and initiatives for fair and sustainable wellness and implementation of the NSDS (Governo Italiano-Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri, 2019).   In 20018, the IMELS launched a working group (of relevant ministries, ISPRA and Italian National Institute of Statistics, ISTAT) to select a core set of indicators for tracking progress on NSDS. The final report was submitted to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers for their follow-up in July 2019. ISTAT is responsible for collecting the indicators proposed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDGs. In 2017, it began inter-institutional comparative work, in the framework of National Statistical System, to produce a methodologically consistent, integrated and shared mapping and assessment of the overall availability of indicators for SDGs (ISTAT, 2019).

Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it! All official European Union website addresses are in the   domain. Briefing Bulgaria's focus on progressing towards the SDGs with environmental action mainly lies in air quality (SDGs 3 and 11), water management (SDG 6), marine protection (SDG 14) and protection of nature and biodiversity (SDG 15). The country is also focusing on establishing a green and energy-efficient economy (SDG 7) (BGRF, 2016) (Plevneliev, 2016). Bulgaria adopted an approach for the whole government which takes into account the interlinkages between the SDGs. In advancing its SDG action, Bulgaria focuses on 10 SDGs with an environmental dimension (SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15).  Bulgaria's first VNR in 2020 outlines some of the initiatives undertaken towards achieving the SDGs. By the end of 2020, the Council of Ministers will adopt the National Development Programme BULGARIA 2030 which will address three main strategic goals: accelerated economic development, demographic upswing, and a reduction in inequalities. The Programme will outline 13 national priorities in five development areas. A ‘Green and Sustainable Bulgaria’ is among these development areas, in which a circular and low-carbon economy (SDGs 7, 8, 12), clean air and biodiversity (SDGs 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), and sustainable agriculture (SDGs 2, 14, 15) will be addressed (UN DESA, 2020). The Programme reflects the approach of the whole government to sustainable development and considers the interlinkages between the SDGs (Republic of Bulgaria, 2020). In drafting the VNR, the Bulgarian government involved multi stakeholders from civil society, marginalised groups, business and academia. Wider public feedback was also sought through an online consultation process (UN DESA, 2019). Bulgaria submitted a VNR to the UN in 2020. The VNR also states that the biggest challenge to successfully integrating the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of Bulgaria's sustainable development policies is the coal sector which still has a significant share of the country’s energy balance. The reasons for this are related to job retention and greater energy security for the country. A solution to this problem is being sought through the preparation of the Integrated national energy and climate plan. This plan covers the five dimensions of the Energy Union for Europe: decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, Internal Energy Market and research, innovation, and competitiveness (Republic of Bulgaria, 2020).   The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing Romania has also undertaken other actions to improve water quality and access to water-supply infrastructure. Its environmental priorities centre on the transition from biomass to renewable energy for household heating (SDG 7); the management of natural protected areas; and sustainable forest management and forest ecosystems (SDG 15) (Ministry of Environment of Romania, 2018).  Romania prioritises SDGs 6, 7, 11 and 12 with an environmental dimension. Romania, as the largest country in the Danube basin, also contributes to developing and updating the Danube River Basin Management Plan. The purpose is to enhance the quality of life and avoid environmental decline by using smart technologies to ensure the sustainable development of communities. Romania focuses its attention on reducing the discharge of nutrient loads into the Danube basin and the Black Sea (SDG 14)(Petcu, 2017). The country has also explored synergies between the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement (SDG 13) and the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (Gavrilescu, 2017).  In Romania, oversight of sustainable development is shared between two entities. The first is the Department for Sustainable Development, under the prime minister’s office, which was created in April 2017 and has been assigned primary responsibility for implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The second is the Interministerial Committee for the Coordination of the Integration of Environmental Protection into Sectoral Policies and Strategies (Interministerial Committee), which has managed sustainable development initiatives in Romania, led by the Minister of Environment (Ministry of Environment of Romania, 2018). In November 2008, Romania adopted its National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS), ‘Horizon 2013-2020-2030’. The country is currently in the process of mapping the SDGs and determining how best to achieve synergies for appropriate SDG action (Ministry of Environment, 2018). The NSDS proposes to establish a Coalition for Sustainable Development, which would act as an NGO and advocate for the SDGs (Ministry of Environment, 2018). Romania submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. The Department for Sustainable Development is collaborating closely with the National Institute of Statistics to monitor Romania’s progress on the SDGs. Romania is currently updating its sustainable development indicator set, as part of both the revised NSDS and the forthcoming National Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) (Ministry of Environment of Romania, 2018). Romania recognises the SDG action should respond directly to citizens’ needs at the local level. Local communities’ needs will be addressed by formulating local and national development strategies (Dulceata, 2017). In 2017 and 2018, Romania organised a series of conferences and seminars to raise awareness of the SDGs and promote participation. Some events were specifically designed to include civil society organisations. Approximately 33 communities have completed Local Sustainable Development Strategies (Ministry of Environment of Romania, 2018).

Briefing Ireland acknowledges that the detrimental effects of climate change are most acutely felt by the most vulnerable in society by undermining their well-being and ability to cope (SDGs 13, 3) (Doyle, 2017). As a small island nation with a relatively large marine territory, Ireland considers its relationship with the marine environment critical to social, environmental, and economic activities (Doyle, 2017). It therefore prioritises SDG 14 (life below water) and has put in place a National Integrated Maritime Plan to manage its marine resources to integrate economic, environmental and social priorities with the SDGs (Breen, 2017). Ireland’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 12, 13 and 14.  The National Development Plan 2018-2027 provides for EUR 116 billion in capital investment over 10 years. Of this, EUR 21.8 billion is allocated to SDG-related projects, including those on renewable energy and energy security (SDG 7) (Government of Ireland, 2018). In 2017, the Government established the National Sustainable Development Unit to carry out those responsibilities. The SDG-specific government entity, the Senior Officials’ Group (SOG) on the SDGs was established to provide support, oversee SDG action and report to the Cabinet. Chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, it is made up of assistant secretaries from all government departments and receives support from the National Sustainable Development Unit and the SDG Interdepartmental Working Group. Each ministry is responsible for the SDG targets in its field of action (Government of Ireland, 2018). Ireland established a national SDG Stakeholder Forum, chaired by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, to facilitate dialogue among representatives from government entities, civil society, NGOs, the private sector, trade unions and academia. Other networks have also facilitated collaboration on the SDGs, such as Coalition 2030, an alliance of over 100 civil society organisations, and Business in the Community Ireland (Government of Ireland, 2018). In 2018, Ireland adopted its first SDG National Implementation Plan for the period 2018-2020 (Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, 2018). The Plan integrates the 2030 Agenda into national policies and identifies the government ministries and agencies responsible for each of the SDG targets. The SDG National Implementation Plan builds on Ireland’s current national sustainable development strategy, ‘Our Sustainable Future’ and its policy for international development, ‘One World, One Future’, and commits Ireland to mainstreaming the SDGs across national policy (UN DESA, 2018).  Ireland submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. The government has mandated the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to lead tracking progress towards the SDGs. It is responsible for data collection, analysis, and publication.  Ireland has a national   for the dissemination of information on the SDGs. The Geohive is its public platform for exploring, downloading, and combining publicly available data relating to the UN and the EU SDGs.

Briefing The country’s SDG Framework document defines key priority areas and targets for reaching Agenda 2030. This vast analytical work has been synthesised into a situation analysis and three development pathways until 2030, along with corresponding accelerators and drivers (Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2019). Bosnia and Herzegovina’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus on SDGs 6, 12, 13, 14 and 15.   Bosnia and Herzegovina clusters its SDG implementation into the ‘5ps’: people, prosperity, planet, peace, partnership. Under the ‘planet’ cluster, it aims to achieve protection from degradation, changes in consumption and production patterns, the sustainable management of natural resources and urgent action on climate change through implementation of SDGs 6, 12, 13, 14 and 15 (Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2019). On SDG 6, Bosnia and Herzegovina is working towards the protection and sustainable use of water resources to ensure that drinking water is accessible to all. For SDG 12, it envisages activities focused on better use of environmental principles in business operations and respect for the principle of energy efficiency. On SDG 13, the emphasis is on taking urgent action to combat the impacts of climate change on the country. On SDG 14, Bosnia and Herzegovina aims to tackle the issue of ballast waters from maritime transport (recognised as the main vectors behind the spread of invasive species in the Adriatic Sea), as the introduction of invasive species and the loss of biodiversity further threaten tourism and fishing activities, including in coastal areas. On SDG 15, Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to implement activities aimed at the sustainable management of forests, combatting desertification, halting and reversing land degradation and halting biodiversity loss. The Directorate for Economic Planning is the leading body for implementation of the SDGs (Oprašić, 2016). Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019. In October 2016, the UN in Bosnia and Herzegovina launched ‘Imagine2030’ (Zamisli 2030), an umbrella initiative to advocate, promote and engage citizens with the SDGs and to create a consultation tool for them (Oprašić, 2016).

Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it! All official European Union website addresses are in the   domain. Briefing As it considers economic growth, social development and climate change adaptation and mitigation to be interlinked with sustainable industry and technological progress, it also prioritises SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure). Portugal’s ‘Action Plan for a Circular Economy’ is key to the necessary new sustainable society model (SDG 12) (Republic of Portugal). Portugal identifies SDGs 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 as environmental priority areas. The Ministry of Environment and Climate Action defined its action strategy based on three key pillars: promoting the circularity of the economy (SDG 12); when valuing the nature in land (SDG 15); and being on track to carbon neutrality (SDG 13). The Ministry reinforced the intersectoral and cross-cutting environmental public policy with a permanent dialogue with all stakeholders and several levels of the administration, enabling a continuous evaluation to better optimise the appropriate level of SDG actions. Therefore, the country also considers partnerships (SDG17) are essential and key for environmental action. Portugal attaches importance to breaking the silos within and among government and other public institutions, at both the national and local level, as well as engaging with civil society in this process. The important level of public awareness, namely with NGOs, academia or local authorities’ interventions, oblige complete transparency in actions and guarantees permanent public evaluation by the media. Pre-existing social and political structures and processes on sustainable development as well as strong political support and active civil society engagement have enabled Portugal to respond to most of the SDG targets.  Portugal submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017.  In 2016, the Portuguese Council of Ministers adopted Intra-Governmental Guidelines for the 2030 Agenda and established the Focal Point Network comprising representatives from different public institutions. Within this structure, each ministry was designated as being responsible for the relevant SDGs. In 2016, when this coordination mechanism was created, the Ministry of Environment was appointed as responsible for SDGs 6, 11, 12 and 13. A public consultation on SDG action at the national and local level also took place that year, along with an online survey intended to reach a wider audience and provide an opportunity for every citizen to participate (Republic of Portugal, 2017).  In line with existing practice in the Ministry of Environment and Climate Action, the 2030 Agenda adoption has improved all the ministry’s partners awareness of the interdependency of sectorial and regional policies, smoothing the necessary common decision-making processes. The main environmental instruments have benefitted from this new vision, allowing more extensive intersectoral and public discussions and improved ownership of the Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality, the Action Plan for a Circular Economy, the National Plan for Energy and Climate, the National Program for Spatial Planning, and the National Strategy for Nature Conservation and Biodiversity. The country’s baseline analysis on SDG progress began with the collection of data and information in relation to the SDGs (Republic of Portugal, 2017). As a result, the National Statistical Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estatística) mapped the available information and identified the most appropriate sources of indicators for tracking SDGs progress. The next step for the government includes the consolidation of this work, improving the robustness of the existing indicators, developing calculation methods for the missing indicators, the possibility of introducing qualitative indicators (Republic of Portugal, 2017).

Briefing The country’s priority targets reflect the government’s emphasis on SDG action. They include: improved resource efficiency in consumption and production and decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation (SDG 8); reducing the adverse per-capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management (SDG 11); restructuring taxation and phasing out  fossil fuel subsidies to reflect their environmental impacts (SDG 12); and integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning (SDG 13) (Prime Minister’s Office, 2019). The Interministerial Working Group mapped Iceland’s position on all 169 targets and specified 65 priority targets which include conservation of the natural environment and combatting climate change. With respect to climate change (SDG 13), the government aims to build partnerships to address the large environmental footprint of modern lifestyles. Iceland is still a net contributor to climate change but is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2040 (Prime Minister’s Office, 2019). The government will also undertake actions to further develop the bioeconomy, green solutions, and methods to reduce the environmental impact of food production by means of incentives and support for carbon offsetting (among others) in the sector (SDG 2). Other actions include strengthening organic farming and highlighting the uniqueness of Icelandic raw materials cultivated under sustainable conditions (Prime Minister’s Office, 2019). Iceland’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.   Iceland attaches vital importance to life below water (SDG 14) and prioritises its actions. To protect the marine environment, it has made voluntary commitments to reduce marine litter in its waters. Iceland held the co-chairmanship of the ‘Increasing Scientific Knowledge and Developing Research Capacity and Transfer of Marine Technology’ partnership at the UN Ocean Conference in June 2017. It has also committed to implementing a harvest control rule to manage commercially important fish stocks in Icelandic waters (Gunnarsdottir, 2017). The government’s fiscal strategy focuses on sustainable productivity, a reduction in GHG emissions, monitoring risk factors, and green solutions for the environment. In recent years, Iceland has paid special attention to integrating gender perspectives into environmental and climate issues and is committed to supporting specific measures to promote the position of women in this field. In particular, the Icelandic government has supported the SEforALL’s People-Centered Accelerator platform which is intended to promote gender equality and emphasises the social participation and promotion of women in the energy sector globally (SDG 7)(Prime Minister’s Office, 2019). Iceland initiated SDG action in 2016 through a gap analysis on available information on sustainable development. It subsequently issued a status report on the SDGs, including extensive work on the analysis and prioritisation of SDGs, targets and indicators. This report served as the basis for Iceland’s National Action Plan for Sustainable Development (NORDEN, 2017). In March 2017, the government appointed a working group represented by the Prime Minister’s Office, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources, the Ministry of Welfare, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, and Statistics Iceland. This Interministerial Working Group manages the analysis, action, and promotion of the SDGs. To ensure the involvement of all ministries, a contact group was also formed, comprising representatives of other ministries and an observer from the Association of Local Authorities in Iceland (Prime Minister’s Office, 2019). Iceland submitted a VNR to the UN in 2019.   The Group mapped Iceland’s position on all 169 targets and specified 65 priority targets to guide authorities for SDG action. In 2019, the SDG Working Group launched an information portal, offering citizens, NGOs, companies, institutions, municipalities and others the opportunity to present projects that contribute to the promotion of the SDGs (Prime Minister’s Office, 2019).   The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it! All official European Union website addresses are in the   domain. Briefing The Belgian Constitution lays down that every federal entity should pursue sustainable development objectives in its social, economic and environmental dimensions, taking into account solidarity between the generations. The federal entities are on an equal footing but have powers and responsibilities in different fields. Belgium is focusing on all SDGs, working through overarching strategies to address interlinkages. The country’s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension lies primarily in SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 16.   Progress towards the 2030 Agenda relies on a variety of existing sustainable development strategies adopted by the respective levels of government. At the federal level, the strategy encompasses a Long-term Vision (LTV, approved in 2013) and the Federal Plan for Sustainable Development (approved in 2008). At the regional level, key strategic frameworks include: the 2nd Walloon Sustainable Development Strategy (approved in 2016); the Flemish Vision 2050 (a long-term strategy for Flanders, approved in 2016) and Focus 2030 (Flanders’ goals for 2030, preliminarily approved in 2018); the Brussels-Capital Region’s Regional Sustainable Development plan (approved in 2013); and the German-speaking Community’s second regional development plan (approved in 2014). To achieve the NSDS and promote coherence in the implementation of sustainable development policy in Belgium, an Interministerial Conference for Sustainable Development (IMCSD) was established in 2012 and revitalised in 2015. The IMCSD is mandated to follow up implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Belgium (UN DESA, 2017). The updated NSDS was approved in 2017, following a civil consultation process with the relevant stakeholders. It provides the umbrella framework for the main government stakeholders at both federal and federated levels to combine their efforts to achieve the SDGs. The NSDS sets out how the various authorities in Belgium should cooperate and link their strategies to ensure they are coherent with the SDGs (UN DESA, 2017). The Federal Institute for Sustainable Development (FIDO-IFDD) is the main institution with responsibility for SDG actions. In collaboration with the Ministry for Sustainable Development, FIDO-IFDD has developed several pathways for SDG implementation. Flanders adopted a decree for sustainable development in September 2008. The first Flemish strategy for sustainable development was developed in 2006, largely based on the thematic priorities of the European Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS). The second Flemish strategy for sustainable development was adopted on 29 April 2011. In March 2016, the Flemish government presented its new strategic outlook for the future: ‘Vision 2050: A long-term strategy for Flanders’. Vision 2050 is designed around seven transition processes: the circular economy, smart living, Industry 4.0, lifelong learning and a dynamic professional career, caring and living together in 2050, transport and mobility, and energy. Implementation of these transition priorities will be cross-sectoral and undertaken in collaboration with innovators, entrepreneurs, and stakeholders. A new governance model was developed, inspired by transition management principles. In 2018, a preliminary set of 49 Flemish goals — based on the SDGs — was agreed by the Flemish government. This set of 2030 goals for Flanders, called ‘Focus 2030’, will be measured by a set of region-specific indicators. In 2013, the Walloon government adopted a decree on the Walloon sustainable development strategy which foresees the development of such a strategy and determines its key elements. Based on the decree — and following a first strategy adopted in October 2013 — the second Walloon sustainable development strategy was adopted on 7 July 2016. This aims to put some transition paths in place and contribute to implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. A public consultation on the LTV and action plan (first and fourth chapters of the strategy) was undertaken in 2016. In parallel, the public was invited to post commitments on the website or to identify projects that contribute to the action plan priorities and thus to the transition to sustainable development in Wallonia. The Brussels-Capital Region has undergone profound changes and is now facing new challenges, such as rapid demographic growth, employment, training and education, poverty, environment, mobility and internationalisation. Between 13 January and 13 March 2017, the Brussels government held a public inquiry into the new draft of the Regional Sustainable Development Plan. It sets priorities to make the Brussels-Capital Region more attractive, more inclusive socially and economically, more competitive, more creative in research, and greener and more efficient in its use of energy and resources. Since 2007, through its ‘Agenda Iris 21’ programme, Brussels Environment (the environmental administration in Brussels-Capital) has provided financial and methodological support to municipalities and public centres for social assistance (CPAS) implementing local Agenda 21 projects. In the German-speaking Community, the Regional Development Concept was conceived as a long-term strategy for the German-speaking government. The process was initiated in May 2008 with a comprehensive stocktaking and regional analysis to examine the Community’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges. The mission statement was published as REK (the Development Concept) volumes 1 and 2. In April 2011, the third volume detailed the initial implementation phase of the REK, comprising 16 main projects and 48 sub-projects (Living East Belgium – 2025). Belgium launched the ‘SDG Charter for International Development’ to unite the private sector, civil society and the public sector around the SDGs and international development. More than 100 companies and organisations have signed up to the Charter. Civil society made a significant contribution to Belgium’s VNR, issuing coordinated advisory opinions on the draft review (UN DESA, 2017). The Interfederal Statistical Institute (IIS) is responsible for systematically tracking progress on SDG actions. As a first step, the IIS selected the two most relevant, measurable, and available indicators per SDG ( ). The SDG indicators database will be upgraded to include more indicators from the list defined at the UN level. The NSDS established a reporting mechanism on the SDGs, with reports made to the parliament and civil society twice per government term. Civil society was also invited to report its own 2030 Agenda initiatives (UN DESA, 2017). The Belgian NSDS action plan identified several priority themes including sustainable food (SDG 2), sustainable building and housing (SDG 11), and sustainable public procurement (SDG 16) (De Croo, 2017b).  Submitted to the UN in 2017, the Belgian VNR also highlights areas of further action, including water (SDGs 6 and 14) and air quality (SDG 3), energy intensity and renewable energy (SDG 7) and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (SDG 13). The Belgian government is now looking into ways to address these areas (De Croo, 2017b). Belgium submitted a VNR to the UN in 2017. Belgium has identified the need for a detailed mapping of all gaps in SDG action at all levels of its federal system. Furthermore, the Federal Planning Bureau (FPB) uses the Federal Sustainable Development Reports to evaluate federal policies on sustainable development, as well as presenting foresight scenarios (FPB, 2017). At the regional level, Wallonia has published its first SDG implementation report, adopted by the Walloon government in April 2017. It includes an inventory of the Walloon strategies and plans that contribute to achieving the SDGs, an analysis of 70 selected indicators and a set of good practices by Walloon public institutions, civil society and the private sector. Flanders is currently developing a framework of indicators for its ‘Focus 2030: A 2030 objectives framework for Flanders’.

Briefing In achieving SDGs with an environmental dimension, Poland focuses primarily on SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13 and 15. Under the planet cluster, improving air quality in Polish cities remains a priority (SDGs 3, 11). Objectives also include achieving high water quality (SDG 6); protecting the soil against degradation (SDG 15); reducing the impact of noise and electromagnetic fields on society (SDG 3); as well as increasing available water resources (SDG 6); the sustainable management of terrestrial resources (SDG 15); and ensuring efficient waste management (SDG 12) (Government of Poland, 2018). A boost for the implementation of the environmental SDGs was the agreement on and adoption of the 2030 National Environmental Policy – the Development Strategy in the Area of the Environment and Water Management, setting several environmental priorities. Moreover, citizens have become more environmentally conscious in recent years – protecting air quality and climate change have been gaining interest. In addition, a new Ministry of Climate (MoC) was established to operate independently of the Ministry of Environment. The MoC is responsible for climate action and sustainable development issues. Sustainable water management was also transferred from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Maritime Economy and Inland Navigation. Poland has also identified areas which require further action. For example, since its energy policy has yet to be updated, this has become a priority for the current MoC (SDG 7). SDGs’ visibility and their recognition tends to be limited to experts. As regards sustainable cities (SDG 11), the main objective is to improve the quality of life and support cities in their transition towards sustainability and climate neutrality. Air quality remains another priority. The clean air programme is being amended to boost the number of investments across the country. Moreover, actions have been undertaken to improve the waste-management system and support the e-mobility sector. A reduction in GHG emissions will be pursued within financial instruments such as ‘My electricity’, ‘Agro-energy’ and ‘Polish Geothermy Plus’. New regulations to improve and harmonise the process of preparing the acoustic maps and environmental protection plans have also been introduced, although better coordination is needed both at the national and local level to consolidate all noise data and decisions. Business, private institutions, scientific and research institutions, and non-governmental organisations were included in activities aimed at developing various government strategies on SDG action with an environmental dimension. Stakeholder engagement activities included mainly consultations and workshops. For example, for the purpose of developing the 2030 National Environmental Policy, a consultation conference was organised and an online questionnaire launched. The consultation proved popular among civil society organisations. In 2017, the Ministry of Economic Development initiated the Partnership for the SDGs, inviting all stakeholders to share their experiences and activities on SDGs. Signatories to the Partnership undertake and communicate a number of initiatives, including in the area of the environment, such as striving for the highest standards of environmental protection; innovative ways of introducing the principles of the circular economy;  reducing the consumption of water and other resources; environmentally safe processing and transport of raw materials; projects aiming to reduce pollution, waste and the consumption of raw materials; support for school and educational institutions in the field of environmental education; as well as the development of vehicles based on clean energy and fuel-saving practices. Within the Urban Agenda (SDG11), the MoC has planned to organise 16 regional workshops to discuss how to create greener cities, bringing together stakeholders from civil society organisations, academia and local governments. Social participation played a significant role in the development of ‘Urban Adaptation Plans for cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants in Poland’ project (SDGs 11, 13). The project’s main, in partnership with the 44 major Polish cities, was to assess their sensitivity and vulnerability to climate change and to develop priority adaptation measures adequate for the risks identified for each city (Government of Poland, 2018). Other partnerships have also been created and developed, including the UNEP/GRID-Warsaw Centre SDG Partnership ‘Together for the environment’. It initiates and implements projects addressing those SDGs with an environmental dimension. It was created to exchange ideas, experiences and good practices and build broad cooperation to achieve SDGs. Partnership activities are focused on education and raising awareness. Many different stakeholders are involved, including companies, associations of companies and chambers of commerce, research and development institutions, public administration, central and local government, non-governmental organisations, and informal initiatives as well as individuals (GRID-Warsaw in Partnership with UN Environment, 2018). Poland not only prioritises the achievement of individual goals, but also the interactions between them. To increase the effectiveness of achieving the SDGs, the country recognises the importance of education for sustainable development, effective monitoring systems, and policy coherence. It also considers that more clarity is required as regards the role of different international and European institutions in the SDGs process along with streamlining their actions (Government of Poland, 2018). Poland submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. The Council of Ministers sets out the overall sustainable development objectives and policies. Sector-specific bodies coordinate different aspects of Poland’s development strategy, including the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers (economic policy) and the Social Committee of the Council of Ministers (social issues). The Ministry of Economic Development is responsible for coordination of the 2030 Agenda. An important body under the institutional mechanism is the Coordination Committee for Development Policy, one of the prime minister’s advisory bodies. Line ministries are involved in SDG actions within their relevant areas of competence. A special Task Force for Coherence between the Strategy for Responsible Development and the 2030 Agenda was created within the Coordination Committee to prioritise the SDG targets, and facilitate dialogue and collaboration related to the 2030 Agenda and the VNR (Government of Poland, 2018).  Statistics Poland oversees data collection and both the provision and creation of indicators to track SDG progress. To assess progress towards the SDGs on the global level, it coordinates the provision of data for the official UN indicators. It developed SDG indicators to track the realisation of national SDG priorities, defined by the Polish government in 2018. To complement the VNR report submitted to the UN in 2018, Statistics Poland prepared the publication ‘A picture of Poland: Statistics for SDGs’, introducing foreign readers to Poland and its role in achieving the SDGs (Statistics Poland, 2018).

Briefing National strategies and programmes supporting actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension (National Environmental Programme, National Framework Strategy on Sustainable Development, etc. and their implementation reports) are being developed through strong stakeholder involvement and consultation. Stakeholder representatives are members of the National Environmental Council and National Council on Sustainable Development. Hungary’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 13 and 15.   To strengthen its commitment to environmental sustainability, Hungary established a new Directorate for Environmental Sustainability within the Office of the President in 2015. The Directorate maintains contact with national and international bodies, educational institutions, and organisations, prepares background information and supports the President’s Office in issues pertaining to sustainable development (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, 2018).   Hungary deems environmental education and education on sustainability (including awareness raising among decision-makers) essential as environmental awareness is the basis for behaviour change. For this reason, the country initiated the Green Kindergarten Network, the Eco-School Network and several environmental sustainability programmes. Hungary submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018.   In Hungary, line ministries are responsible for SDG action within their respective domains. An Interministerial Coordination Mechanism was established in 2017 and is made up of representatives from each line ministry, the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, civil society, academia and the private sector. The National Framework Strategy on Sustainable Development (NFSSD) 2012-2024 also assigns responsibilities to municipalities in terms of the sustainable development of cities. Civil society organisations were invited to participate in the development and adoption of the NFSSD. The Business Council for Sustainable Development in Hungary also participated in the SDG national adaptation process, including the review of the VNR (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, 2018). The Hungarian Central Statistical Office has published   every two years since 2007, most recently in 2015, in English (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, 2018), and in 2019, in Hungarian). Currently, data are available in Hungary for approximately 75 % of the SDG indicators. Many of Hungary’s SDG actions have faced financial barriers as it is a great challenge to find and allocate the appropriate sources. Improved sectoral integration and coordination would better facilitate the country’s actions on SDGs with an environmental dimension (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, 2018). The Hungarian government tries to involve the broad spectrum of stakeholders (civil society, businesses, scientific community, etc.) in planning and implementing the SDGs. For example, in 2018, the Hungarian VNR was the result of a comprehensive public consultation in cooperation with the Civil Roundtable for Sustainable Development Goals (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, 2018). The Climate and Environmental Protection Action Plan was announced on 16 January 2020 by the prime minister. It proposes eight action points, including waste management,  The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing In addressing SDGs with an environmental dimension, Austria focuses primarily on SDGs 2, 6, 7, 13 and 15. In Austria, sustainable development is a constitutional state goal. It launched its SDG actions with a Decision of the Austrian Council of Ministers on January 2016, based on a national stocktaking exercise (UNECE 2016). In line with the universal nature of the 2030 Agenda, the Decision of the Council of Ministers emphasised a mainstream approach: aligning regular national policy frameworks at the sectoral level with the SDGs (taking an ‘SDG lens’) (Republic of Austria, 2020). Austria addresses the SDGs through its federal ministries in their respective areas of responsibility by integrating the SDGs into their ministerial jurisdiction of policy and administration (BKA, 2016). The Inter-Ministerial Working Group on the 2030 Agenda (IMAG) handles the general coordination and communication of SDG actions. It is chaired by the Federal Chancellery and the Ministry of Foreign affairs and involves line ministries that may be associated with SDG actions (UNECE, 2016). Following a multi-stakeholder approach, representatives of federal states, cities, municipalities, social partners, stakeholders from civil society, business and the scientific community interact with the IMAG and are committed to SDG implementation (Republic of Austria, 2020). The Austrian Court of Auditors is committed to making an active contribution to the SDGs through its audits. The SDGs have been incorporated into most of the auditing activities under the ‘sustainability and intergenerational equity’ theme (BKA, 2016). In addition, all major public policies and projects are now subject to an annual impact assessment in which ministries evaluate whether their measures and individual projects will make a significant contribution to achieving the SDGs (BKA, 2016).   Austria submitted a VNR to the UN in 2020. Austria`s national statistical agency, Statistik Austria, developed a national SDG indicator set, in close consultation with the EU (BKA, 2016). Based on Statistik Austria’s 2017 National Indicator Set, the preliminary final version of the National Indicator Report was presented in March 2020.

Briefing Norway`s action towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focuses primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15. As for the crucial area of climate change, a national follow-up of the Paris Agreement will constitute the main basis for action to fulfil SDG 13. Addressing the responsible use and protection of oceans and marine environments is particularly pressing. This is important for Norway and other coastal states whose livelihoods and welfare depend on the sea (UN DESA, 2016). Recently, Norway adopted an action plan for biodiversity as a tool for achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (SDG 15) (UN DESA, 2016). After the adoption of the SDGs in September 2015, the Norwegian government developed a national plan for their implementation and follow-up. To ensure policy coherence and coordination, the Minister of Foreign Affairs established a project on the post-2015 development agenda and an Interministerial Contact Group, which analysed the SDGs in terms of their potential consequences and challenges for the country (UN DESA, 2016). Responsibility for each of the 17 SDGs has been given to a coordinating ministry which consults with other ministries to follow up various targets under the goal concerned. In each ministry, targets have been assigned to individual units, thereby distributing the responsibility for implementation of the SDGs across all levels of government (NORDEN, 2017). Norway views civil society engagement as vital to the national ownership of the 2030 Agenda. The government conducts consultations with stakeholders on SDG implementation and places emphasis on the private sector and business to achieve scaled-up implementation and financing for the 2030 Agenda (UN DESA, 2016). Norway regards participatory, inclusive, and representative decision-making as fundamental for a well-functioning society. Participation is vital for ensuring the national ownership necessary for an effective and transparent follow-up of the SDGs. As far as spreading knowledge about them is concerned, the recommendation by the Ministry of Education to include the SDGs as part of the curriculum in schools is valuable (UN DESA, 2016). Norway has begun to incorporate the global SDG indicators in its national context. It will define additional national SDG indicators, where necessary, to ensure comprehensive monitoring at the national level (UN DESA, 2016).  Norway submitted a VNR to the UN in 2016. Norway has a reporting system in place for its national targets. Each year, the ministries will report their progress toward the SDGs to the Norwegian parliament (Storting) in their budget proposals. This is a vital as the annual budgets are key political documents for policymaking (UN DESA, 2016).

Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it! All official European Union website addresses are in the   domain. Briefing Greece identified and endorsed eight national priorities for SDG action, on which the country’s 2018 VNR was based. The sixth national priority is ‘strengthening the protection and sustainable management of natural capital as a base for social prosperity and transition to a low-carbon economy’. The policies and measures to achieve this priority include: The priority given to SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 with an environmental dimension is based on the notion that Greece’s natural environment constitutes not only the identity of the country but is also a key asset for development. Thus, environmental protection is regarded as the basis for ensuring sustainable economic growth — for example, through quality tourism and the production of quality agricultural products and food, as these two sectors are the backbone of the Greek economy and rely on the quality of the natural environment. This is also the basis for social well-being as it safeguards human health and access to high-quality environmental and ecosystem services for citizens (Hellenic Republic, 2018). Greece prioritises actions towards SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 with an environmental dimension As Greece is a maritime nation and a coastal state, shipping, fishing, development of offshore energy sources, port and transportation facilities, recreation and tourism are vital economic activities (SDG 14). The country also recognises the interlinkage between SDG 14 and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), because the health and well-being of coastal populations — especially of island communities, which are sometimes wholly dependent upon fishing and tourism — are linked to the quality of the marine environment (Kalamvrezos, 2017). Greece submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. Greece aims to revisit its overall development through an ‘SDGs lens’, hoping to boost the economy, stimulate decent employment, strengthen social protection and inclusion, and protect the environment and natural capital. The SDGs offer the country a new vision for sustainable development, ensuring the spread of prosperity and the protection of the most vulnerable and fostering economic stability founded on a sound ecological basis. It also approaches SDGs through a long-term institutional mechanism that takes an approach supported by the whole government. This includes an Interministerial Coordination Network comprising representatives from line ministries and steered by the presidency of the government which has undertaken the role of coordinating national efforts to achieve the SDGs from a long-term perspective (Hellenic Republic, 2018). To enhance transparency, partnership and accountability, actions and activities have been carried out with non-state actors. The Economic and Social Council of Greece (ESC) is the institution constitutionally responsible for conducting social dialogue among major social partners and stakeholders. Within this context, in 2017, on the request of the General Secretariat of the Government, the ESC issued an opinion entitled ‘UN 2030 Agenda - Priority Objectives for Greece’. This presented its views on the national prioritisation of the SDGs, submitting a comprehensive set of proposals regarding effective SDG actions on key economic, social and environmental aspects of the SDGs at different levels and sectors (i.e. economic growth, employment and social protection, sustainable energy, industrialization, and innovation that would create positive spillover effects for all other SDGs (Hellenic Republic, 2018). The Hellenic Statistical System (ELSS) is the set of rules, tasks and competent bodies responsible for the execution of statistical assignments, with the aim of developing, producing and disseminating official statistics. The Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) coordinates the system and is responsible for certifying the statistics of the ELSS authorities and organisations. By 2019, line ministries together with ELSTAT, had carried out three rounds of consultations and mapping to identify and select the most adequate indicators for tracking progress at the national level. A list of around 160 indicators (90 selected from the global SDGs indicator framework and 70 from Eurostat adapted to national priorities and circumstances) were selected for quantitative tracking of progress towards the SDGs. At the same time, this emphasis made for more active involvement by the national parliament from a more political and qualitative perspective in the future, allowing for political input and the ‘fine-tuning’ of priorities and a focus on any potential gaps (Hellenic Republic, 2018).   The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing To support SDG action, Albania has prepared an SDG baseline report to explore the specific components of the National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI) pillars. Albania’s baseline report underscores that the national strategic policy framework is most harmonised with the SDG targets in SDG 3 (good health and well-being); SDG 7 (affordable and Clean Energy); SDG 8 (good jobs and economic growth); and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), while the least harmonisation is with SDG 14 (life below water) (Ciko, 2018). Albania’s actions towards SDGs with an environmental dimension focus primarily on SDGs 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 and 15.   Published in 2018, Albania`s VNR identifies six key priority areas, including energy (SDG 7), water (SDGs 6, 14) and integrated land management (SDGs 11, 15) (Republic of Albania, 2018). The NSDI 2015-2020 draws up a plan for the 2030 Agenda by connecting the SDGs with its key components. Although the Albanian sustainable development agenda includes a variety of different domains, the main achievements are expected to be reforms in four main areas, including environmental protection, and competitive economy (Republic of Albania, 2016). Albania submitted a VNR to the UN in 2018. The Albanian parliament formed an Interministerial Committee on the SDGs, chaired by the deputy prime minister. This Committee is responsible for ensuring dialogue between the government and stakeholders, as well as integration of the SDGs in Albania’s strategic framework (Marika, 2016). The Official Statistical Programme for 2017-2021 was approved by the parliament in February 2017 and includes a set of national SDG indicators (EUROSTAT, 2017).

Briefing Although there does not appear to be any correlation with the levels of SDG governance chosen by countries, there is  , and mechanisms for tracking SDG progress. Various working groups have responsibility for activities such as: Such groups are also important for providing leadership, high-level political support, and impetus, such as that provided by the Interministerial Conference on Sustainable Development. Other actions noted in countries include designating lead ministries or institutions to coordinate the SDG process, and conducting gap analyses or mapping [ ] related to SDG actions at the national level. : EEA’s own analysis. Most Eionet countries have made efforts to align their existing indicator sets and underlying data to the  . Some of these global indicators generally do not have readily available equivalent indicators at the national level. As a result, some countries have performed a mapping exercise to compare existing national indicators relevant to the SDGs and the UN SDG indicators, identify indicator and data gaps, and prepare plans to develop new indicators and collect missing data. Based on current VNR reporting, 37 out of 39 (95 %) Eionet countries already have or are developing national SDG indicator sets. At the European level, Eurostat have developed an   (UN, 2017b) which includes time-series data for 99 indicators across all 17 SDGs for all EU Member States. In relation to national progress reporting, 19 (49 %) Eionet countries [ ] are already producing regular national reports on their progress towards the SDGs. Some countries report on an annual basis, whereas others do so less frequently. National SDG progress reports usually build on the national SDG indicator sets. In some cases, national SDG progress reports are produced at the same time as the VNRs. Despite shortcomings in the availability of data, some countries [ ] acknowledged that the VNR process provided an important opportunity to reassess their existing national sustainable development priorities against the SDGs and to critically evaluate the current state of SDG actions. There has been increased interest and steady progress in the number of Eionet countries submitting VNRs to the UN. To date, 37 countries have submitted a VNR: 8 countries [ ] submitted their VNRs in 2016; 10 [ ] in 2017; 12 [ ] countries in 2018; and 7 countries [ ] in 2019. Austria and Bulgaria submitted a VNR in 2020, whereas Switzerland (2016 and 2018) and Turkey (2016 and 2019) submitted two VNRs. Finland and Germany have also committed to submitting second VNRs in the future. Many countries explicitly include stakeholders from outside government within Agenda 2030 working and advisory groups. Based on Eionet countries’ VNRs, dialogue with stakeholders and their participation in prioritisation, decision-making and the implementation of SDGs is noted in 32 of the 39 countries analysed (82 %).  Stakeholders consulted on SDG policies and strategies include civil society, the private sector and public and academic institutions. Online stakeholder consultation platforms, to collect feedback from the public, and web-based SDG monitoring platforms, to disseminate information on progress towards the SDGs, have been developed in eight countries (21 % of the 39 analysed) [ ]. Stakeholders are also important in the implementation of SDGs. Examples include voluntary commitments from civil society and businesses to support actions towards achieving  the   (Office of the Government of the Czech Republic, 2017), and emphasis in Norway on scaling-up implementation and financing for Agenda 2030 through the active participation of the private sector. Of the 39 countries analysed, 29 [ ] (74 %) have set up interministerial bodies, advisory councils, commissions or working groups to coordinate SDG actions among their relevant institutions. In addition to government ministries and agencies, these groups often include other relevant stakeholders, such as regional and local governments, civil society and business associations. The remaining countries have established governance coordination within a specific national government department or agency.

Briefing Based on an analysis of the VNRs [ ] [ ] on SDG progress and action for those SDGs with an environmental dimension (Figure 1), 27 [ ] of 39 Eionet countries declared some form of environmental emphasis related to the SDGs.  Among these, the most frequently prioritised SDGs (each by 15 countries) are SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 14 (life below water). The   reflects the common need for an urgent response to climate change. The UN’s     in July 2017 was identified as a key driver for countries’ self-reflection and assessment on progress towards the protection of marine environment, which is the main objective of SDG 14, the third most prioritised SDG with an environmental dimension. SDG 15 (life on land) is also frequently prioritised, with 14 Eionet countries expressing a focus or emphasis on this SDG in their VNRs, indicating  While some countries have chosen to prioritise certain SDGs with an environmental dimension,  . However, as stipulated in the UNSDSN’s ‘Getting Started with the SDGs’ guide  ,  . Instead, prioritisation means identifying the areas lagging furthest behind to catalyse resources, awareness, and policy actions to spur rapid progress and to use those areas as entry points to the broader sustainability transformation. Based on countries’ VNR reporting, for each SDG there is a range of environmental action across countries. A review of the areas in which Eionet countries are focusing domestic environmental action (Figure 1) shows that at least 90 % of Eionet countries have some form of focused action related to   (water and sanitation),   (affordable and clean energy),   (sustainable cities and communities),   (climate action) and   (life on land). Where there are  , this may reflect national contexts and policy priorities. For example, countries which do not have environmental actions focused on   (life below water) include those that are landlocked (e.g. Austria, Liechtenstein and Slovakia). Approximately 30 % of Eionet countries do not have environmental actions related to   (good health and wellbeing) and   (industry, innovation and infrastructure). This may indicate that many countries consider these SDGs to be only indirectly related to environmental action. However,   focusing efforts in similar areas. For example, on   (affordable and clean energy), 30 countries reported action related to energy efficiency, and for   (life on land), 34 countries reported action related to the preservation of biodiversity or halting its loss.   in actions by countries: for example,   (water and sanitation), where the most common focus of action is on wastewater management (13 countries) but a wide range of other actions, such as those related to drinking water quality, water efficiency and managing groundwater reserves, are reported by between 5 and 10 countries. Where there is a   across countries, this is likely to reflect the influence of   (e.g. geography and climate influencing water availability) and   on countries’ choices concerning what to focus on. Some countries also adopt more  . For instance, two countries are supporting   to help move towards zero hunger ( ), three countries are encouraging the  , and one country is establishing   to help move towards sustainable consumption and production ( ). In addition, currently,   (for reporting to the UN on SDGs) in  [ ] are their  , whereas in  , the responsibility of acting as the national focal point is  . In countries which have assigned their Ministries of Environment as the national focal points to the UN’s 2030 Agenda, the significance of the environmental dimension of the SDGs could be considered more prominent.   EEA’s own assessment.

Briefing The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) has produced a global SDG Index since 2016, and in 2019, published two flagship reports assessing global and country progress in implementing the SDGs. The first report [ ], published in  , considered progress in all UN member states, while the second report [ ], published in  , focused on progress in EU Member States. The 2019 Europe Sustainable Development Report is the first independent quantitative report on the progress of the EU and its Member States towards the SDGs. Each report includes quantitative SDG indices showing countries’ progress against SDG indicators and indicating that European countries are leading globally in the progress towards achieving the SDGs (SDSN, 2019). Most recently, the European Sustainable Development Network´s (ESDN) Quarterly Report ‘The Implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs at the National Level in Europe – Taking stock of governance mechanisms’ [ ], published in December 2019, provides an overview of the state of implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs at the national level in Europe by surveying ESDN national focal points in around 30 European countries (ESDN, 2020). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report ‘Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand’ also provides country-level information on SDGs. The report compares countries’ relative compliance with the SDGs in OECD countries, 27 of which are EEA members. However, it has a strong data focus, like the Eurostat-led EU SDG monitoring report, which is not the focus of this report. At the EU level, the European Commission (EC) published a   on European action for sustainability on 22 November 2016. As part of this package, the EC presented a mapping of the existing European actions with the SDGs and stated that all 17 SDGs were being addressed through European action. However, it added that stronger implementation and further focused action in all areas would be required to implement the full Agenda by 2030 (EC, 2016). In Europe, 2019 marked an important year for tracking country-level SDG progress. In order to catalyse further action to implement the SDGs in Europe, the EC published a non-legislative initiative in the form of a reflection paper,  , on 30 January 2019 (EC, 2019). The Reflection Paper is part of the debate on the future of Europe which was launched through the Commission’s   on 1 March 2017 (EC, 2017). In February 2019, the European Parliament’s study on ‘Europe’s approach to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals: Good practices and the way forward’ was published. Its purpose was to capture the two-level character of SDG implementation at the EU and Member State level, to contribute to a joint voluntary EU report at the HLPF 2019, and to examine governance frameworks in place for the implementation of SDGs in EU Member States through 28 country fact sheets. As the first comprehensive comparative overview of SDG governance in the EU, it also provides an overview of the activities and policy developments at the EU level (EP, 2019). In April 2019, the EC published the second Environment Implementation Review (EIR) [ ], an overview of how EU environmental policies and laws are applied on the ground. It comprises a communication with policy findings and an annex with the priority actions for the EU Member States, a policy background document as well as 28 country reports. The report emphasises that sustainable development links environmental, social and economic policies in a coherent framework and acknowledges that it helps to implement environmental legislation and policies. The second EIR dedicates a section to sustainable development and implementation of the UN SDGs at the end of each country report (EC, 2019).           The European Semester Autumn Package, adopted in December 2019, includes an ‘Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy’ that reflects the Commission's focus on a sustainable and inclusive economic model. This new economic agenda reflects the ambition of the European Green Deal and rests on four dimensions: environmental sustainability, productivity gains, fairness, and macroeconomic stability. Published in February 2020, the   present a thorough analysis of the key socio-economic challenges of macro-economic relevance facing each Member State. The 2020 country reports feature a reinforced analysis and monitoring of the SDGs, including the contribution of macro-economic policies to their delivery. The European Semester 2020 Country Reports feature a section on SDGs and an annex with the EU SDG indicators. These reports emphasise the challenges and opportunities for our economies arising from the green transition. Each country report now includes a summary assessment of Member State progress towards achieving the SDGs as well as a dedicated annex setting out individual Member State’s SDG performance and the trend over the past five years, both based on the set of EU SDG indicators developed by Eurostat. From a sustainability perspective, it is promising to see that SDG knowledge in support of informed policymaking is continuing to expand, particularly in Europe. Similarly, the SOER 2020 stressed that this comprehensive set of sustainability goals and its targets are expected to be increasingly integrated throughout future EU policy frameworks. For an integrated knowledge base on SDG progress, it is also important to apply a combination of qualitative and quantitative SDG assessment approaches [ ].  Against the backdrop of these recent EU-wide developments, this EEA publication stands out through its  . The objective of this analysis is to equip its readers with up-to-date cross-country analysis as well as individual country profiles which give insight into the focus and prioritisation of environmental action across Europe, as well as country-by-country insights. It shows both the convergences and divergences towards environmental sustainability in Europe. The converging environmental focus points to the overall environmental challenges that persist in Europe, whereas diversification indicates emerging challenges or different geographical needs and political priorities in countries. Innovative approaches and good practices in the country profiles reflected here may also be inspirational. Secondly, the   of this publication includes 33 EEA member countries [ ] and 6 cooperating countries [ ]. It is useful for non-EU countries to compare their SDG processes against those of EU Member States as well for the EC to gain insights into environmental actions across Europe. Since 2016, the European Environment Agency (EEA) has performed several mapping activities in relation to the SDGs — for example, the preliminary mapping of the SDGs and global SDG indicators across EEA reports, indicators and data flows (2016).   More recently, in support of the SOER 2020 integrated assessment, the EEA partnered with the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) to build on their methodology and illustrate the importance of considering SDG interactions — i.e. synergies and trade-offs occurring when pursuing the SDG framework as a whole, in a publication entitled ‘SDGs and the environment in the EU: A systems view to improve coherence’ [ ]. This approach is also developed, although with a different focus, by the  , the UN, the OECD and key research organisations (e.g.  ).   :  , p. 15, 2019.   By complementing the EEA’s contribution to the EU SDG monitoring report and the abovementioned report on SDG interactions, this web publication aims to support the knowledge base on SDGs, particularly in light of the EC’s new priorities and the Green New Deal for Europe. In this context, this publication is based on a three-year mapping and analysis of [ ] environmental SDG actions and processes by EEA member and cooperating countries. It was informed by publications on Europe’s SDG actions, a wider NFP/Eionet consultation conducted between February and April 2020, and the UN Voluntary National Reviews published between 2016-2020.  This publication covers country profiles and an accompanying cross-country analysis. The profiles sum up the ways in which countries prioritise or identify the focus of action for those SDGs with an environmental dimension.   in accordance with the approach taken in SOER 2020 (EEA, 2019) (Figure 2). Based on this, the Agency identified 11 SDGs with both direct and indirect environmental dimensions (SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15). These SDGs relate to 7  Environment Action Programme (7EAP) objectives as follows: However, it is important to mention that SDG 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships) are also very important in achieving effective environmental governance and finance.   : EEA compilation based on SOER 2020 (SOER 2020, p.58, 2019). The EEA report SOER 2020 [ ] also highlights that some SDGs embed a strong environmental dimension, particularly SDG 13 on climate action,  SDG 14 on conservation of marine ecosystems, and SDG 15 on the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and the sustainable use of their resources. Environmental sustainability is also sought in relation to agriculture (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), infrastructure and industry (SDG 9), tourism (SDG 8), cities (SDG 11), and consumption and production patterns (SDG 12). In addition to their environmental lens, the country profiles give brief accounts of national plans, strategies and initiatives, governance, and processes as well as stakeholder engagement specifically set up for SDG actions. The information provided for this purpose was gathered mainly from the UN Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) [ ]  submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development between 2016-2020. Acknowledging that VNRs have their own limitations and not all countries have available or recently published VNRs, the EEA also gathered information from other sources listed below, which explore the SDG actions and environmental focus of these 39 countries: To give an overall picture on SDG actions across Europe, the country profiles are accompanied by a cross-country analysis on SDGs in Europe. The EEA cross-country analysis gives an insight on how countries deal with the environmental dimensions of various SDGs. For the environmental analysis,   (Figure 2). For example, in terms of food systems, some countries focused on agriculture whereas others focused on food labelling and food waste. The cross-country analysis also gives a snapshot of Europe as regards delivering Agenda 2030 from an environmental lens.   The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing The SDGs are clustered into five areas, which are also known as the ‘5Ps’ of the 2030 Agenda: people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership. The planet cluster covers SDGs with an environmental focus and aims, inter alia, to protect the planet from degradation by promoting sustainable consumption and production, the sustainable management of natural resources, and taking urgent action on climate change. From a sustainability perspective, it is promising to see that SDG knowledge in support of informed policy making continues to expand, particularly in Europe. Similarly, The European environment – state and outlook 2020 report (SOER 2020) stressed that this comprehensive set of SDGs and its targets are expected to be increasingly integrated throughout future EU policy frameworks. For an integrated knowledge base on SDG progress, it is also important to apply a combination of qualitative and quantitative SDG assessment approaches [ ].  Against the backdrop of recent EU-wide developments on SDGs, this web publication aims to support the knowledge base on SDGs, paying particular attention to the European Commission`s new priorities and the Green New Deal for Europe. In this context, this publication is based on a three-year mapping and analysis of [ ] EEA member and cooperating countries’ environmental SDG actions and procedures.  It has been informed by publications on Europe’s SDG action, an National Focal Points(NFP)/Eionet consultation which took place from February to April 2020, and the UN Voluntary National Reviews published between 2016-2020.  By complementing the EEA’s contribution to the EU SDG monitoring report and a joint report published by Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)/EEA on SDG interactions, this publication aims to equip its readers with a cross-country analysis and individual country profiles which give country-by-country insight into the focus and prioritisation of environmental action across Europe. It shows both the convergences and divergences towards environmental sustainability in Europe. Converging environmental focus points to the overall environmental challenges that persist in Europe, whereas diversification indicates emerging challenges or different geographical needs and political priorities in countries. Innovative approaches and good practices in the country profiles reflected herein may also be inspirational. Secondly, the   of this product includes 33 EEA member countries [ ] and 6 cooperating countries [ ]. It is useful for non-EU countries to compare their SDG actions with those of EU Member States as well as for European Commission to gain insights into environmental action across Europe. This publication covers country briefings and an accompanying cross-country analysis. The briefings sum up the ways in which countries prioritise or identify the focus for their actions on those SDGs with an environmental dimension.   in accordance with the approach taken in SOER 2020 (EEA, 2019) (Figure 2). Based on this, the Agency identified 11 SDGs with both direct and indirect environmental dimensions (SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15). However, it is important to mention that SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships) are also very important in achieving effective environmental governance and finance. In addition to their environmental lens, the country briefings give brief accounts of national plans, strategies and initiatives, institutional structures, and processes as well as stakeholder engagement specifically set up for SDG action. The information provided for this purpose was gathered mainly from the UN Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) [ ] submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development between 2016-2020. Acknowledging that VNRs have their own limitations and that not all countries have available or recently published VNRs, the EEA also gathered information from other sources which explore SDG action and their environmental focus in these 39 countries.           The country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing. , please go to   or scan the QR code. \n       \n     \n                 \n                Engineered by:\n                 \n             \n                    Software updated on\n                    \n                     \n                    from version  \n                 \n                Software version:\n                \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                     \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n            "},

Briefing This narrative is part of a series called ‘ ’ published by the EEA’ Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a year of involuntary as well as voluntary change. While there is still no consensus on how the infectious agent SARS-CoV-2 emerged, the study by Cheng et al. (2007) has been put forward as an example of an early warning. They wrote: Coronaviruses are well known to undergo genetic recombination, which may lead to new genotypes and outbreaks. The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. The possibility of the re-emergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored (Cheng et al., 2007, p.683). Human progress depends on the ability and willingness to learn from the past. The way early warnings of environmental and human hazards emerge, and how they are dealt with, provides us with many ‘late’ lessons (EEA, 2001, 2013). These lessons can help pave the way towards more resilient and better-prepared societies. Previous EEA reports describe cases of unintended environmental hazards caused by the use of chemicals or other activities (EEA, 2001, 2013). These late lessons mainly highlight the need for precautionary approaches and how to strike a balance between desired economic opportunities and uncertain environmental harm. Plagues and pandemics have occurred throughout human history (Waltner-Toews, 2020). However, today’s globalised societies and economies, and the way we interact with the natural environment, affect the way pandemics develop. There is little doubt that new pathogens are often created at the interfaces between wild and domestic animals and humans, and that these sometimes manifest as zoonotic disease (Figure 1). According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2020), ‘60 per cent of known infectious diseases in humans and 75 per cent of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic’, while at least six outbreaks of novel coronaviruses were observed in the last century. Several interacting drivers underpin the emergence of zoonotic diseases by creating novel and diverse contacts among wildlife, livestock and people. These include (1) population growth and rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation, (2) increasing demand for animal protein, with a consequent increase in exploitation of wildlife, agricultural intensification and trade, (3) inadequate husbandry practices and (4) poorly managed informal wildlife and fresh produce markets, and industrial meat processing plants (UNEP, 2020). It is also clear that today’s high levels of international trade and travel make pathogens spread faster, as ‘diseases can now move around the world in periods shorter than their incubation periods’ (UNEP, 2020). : EEA (2020a), adapted from Jones et al. (2013) More attention is also being paid to these complexities in policy fields outside epidemiology and public health, as health crises like COVID-19 have far-reaching implications for people and society at large. The Council of Europe recently addressed the relationship between pandemics and democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law. It reminds us that the COVID-19 crisis should not be used as a pretext for restricting the public’s access to information, and that emergency measures taken by Member States should not undermine EU’s founding values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Council of Europe, 2020). One positive thing that we’ve learned from COVID-19 is that contemporary societies are in fact able to ‘act with necessary force’ when required (Mahmood and Sanchez, 2020). New regulations can be quickly enforced, with certain social practices and economic activities even being prohibited. Airports, restaurants, sports arenas and schools can be closed overnight if the reason is considered legitimate (at least when it is seen as temporary). EU Member States have willingly taken measures against COVID-19 that have had enormous economic costs, along with creating the risk of economic recession and severe unemployment. The global community will need years, if not decades, to assess the full extent of COVID-19 and its implications for our society, including its impacts on inequalities, health and the well-being of citizens (EEA, 2020b). Unprecedented national lockdowns, travel restrictions and the closing of national borders in the first half of 2020 and since have led to short-term improvements in the environment in Europe. Reductions in traffic, shipping and aviation led to sudden improvements in air quality and noise levels, with the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO ) in some cities declining by up to 60% compared with the same period in 2019 (EEA, 2020c). The pandemic also had the immediate effect of encouraging people to choose more active modes of travel. The increase in cycling in particular has prompted cities to become more bike friendly, including by introducing new cycling infrastructure (Kraus and Koch, 2021; Nikitas et al., 2021). A reduction in human activity gave habitats the chance to recover and species the opportunity to occupy new spaces and niches (EEA, 2020d). Moreover, preliminary data show that EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decreased by 10% from 2019 to 2020 (EEA, 2021a). As a society, we should learn from past experiences. The 2008-2009 financial crisis led to lower emissions, but the effect was short-lived (Peters et al., 2012). Now, once again, the imperative to emerge from economic recession and the apparent resilience of unsustainable political and economic priorities provide little hope that the post-corona planet will be more sustainable, unless there is an active and conscious change in social and economic practices. : EEA (2021c) During the pandemic, we have struggled with and learned to cope with the crisis. For a time, we changed our daily actions and reoriented our priorities, valued things differently and perhaps appreciated the natural world around us more. Yet, the question remains as to whether we have changed in any fundamental way. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the systemic frailty of our global economy and society (EEA, 2020e). It is not going too far to say that we are currently living in a world characterised by multiple global crises: a health crisis, an economic and financial crisis, a climate crisis and a crisis in nature (EEA, 2020e). One thing that the history of pandemics has taught us is that more pandemics should be expected (Waltner-Toews, 2020) and we should at the very least be prepared. ‘COVID-19 is not only a wake-up call, it is a dress rehearsal for the world of challenges to come […] The pandemic has taught us that our choices matter. As we look to the future, let us make sure we choose wisely.’ A. Guterres (2020), Secretary-General of the United Nations Taking the early warning from Cheng et al. (2007) seriously would mean considering a range of measures globally, including tackling illegal wildlife trade, closing down illegal food markets, tightening the regulation of industrial meat production, changing social and cultural food practices and, ultimately, changing unsustainable patterns of consumption, urbanisation and natural habitat destruction (IPBES, 2020). As highlighted by the OECD (2021), returning to business as usual would mean missing a vital opportunity to tackle underlying and interconnected environmental, economic, social and relational challenges that pre-date COVID-19. A well-being approach could guide the process of ‘building back better’ (OECD, 2021), especially if underpinned by the realisation that environmental health is a prerequisite for public health. We do not lack knowledge or ideas for action. The limiting factor is agency, the agency to address the driving forces underpinning this and other global crises. The next crisis, whatever form it takes, is likely to reveal itself for what it is: yet another symptom of the same underlying problem — unsustainable human production and consumption (EEA, 2020e). It is this chronic problem that continues to express itself in challenges that are framed either as ‘issues’ — to be addressed in premeditated policy cycles — or as ‘crises’ — requiring extraordinary and emergency measures (Lakoff, 2017). Therefore, our societies’ governance approaches should address not only the underlying roots of the problems themselves, but also the increasingly frequent or even simultaneous emergence of what we used to think of as exceptional crises. To address the sustainability problem we face, social and economic practices must change across different levels and aspects of society: the way we live our lives and the way we eat, move and power our societies cannot remain the same. While enduring COVID-19 lockdowns, French anthropologist and philosopher Bruno Latour proposed an exercise of reflection (Latour, 2020). He suggested that we consider which suspended activities we would like to see gone for good and which we would like to resume; which brand-new activities or habits we would like to develop in the aftermath of the pandemic; and how workers or entrepreneurs disenfranchised by a reshaped economy might be helped to transition into other, more sustainable or more resilient roles or activities. While this exercise can be performed individually, it also gives rise to fundamental questions that deserve attention at institution level. Given the wide recognition that sustainability transitions depend on certain practices being phased out (EEA, 2019), the exercise could even serve as inspiration for the further development and implementation of the European Green Deal. COVID-19 triggered sudden and forceful action. Emergencies have their own dynamics and risks, not least to democracy and legality. Yet, we have seen that, where there’s a will, there’s a way. Reflecting on the unprecedented mobilisation and impact of responses to COVID-19 can inspire new ways of thinking and help humanity to seize the moment and make a change. If we can temporarily shut down parts of society to survive the threat of COVID-19, it seems entirely reasonable that we can make significant societal changes to prevent COVID-22, -25 or -30, not to mention the other threats due to climate change and environmental degradation that we will most likely face.
