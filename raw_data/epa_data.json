Please  . \n When the United States   released its first Climate Literacy Guide in 2009, I taught an Earth & Environmental Science class at a high school in New York. We were wrapping up our unit on climate change and I spoke with the students about small changes we could make to reduce waste. I asked, \"...So what if we all consumed a little less? What if we shopped less, drove less, and tried to alter our daily habits just a little?\" A student of mine spoke up in a steady and certain voice. \"Miss,\" she said, “I think I speak on behalf of the whole class when I say that if I had to stop shopping, I would want to die.\" A handful of my students’ eyes widened in shock similar to mine, but most of the class agreed emphatically with their classmate.    Fresh into my teaching career, I still had a lot to learn, but from that classroom exchange, one thing I realized was that shifting the mindset of students in my classroom, especially on a social norm that valued consumerism over environmentalism, was a challenge with context and nuance far beyond my classroom walls. I knew that I needed to adjust my teaching style and learn as much as I could about both   and  .    As an instructor, I first moved towards overhauling my own mindset and misconceptions before I could address pedagogy. My mentor  , a leader in  , guided me to learn more about deliberative discussion, connecting to my students’ personal lives, and how to incorporate predominantly hands-on, project-based learning into my classroom unit plans. This included researching the cradle-to-grave journey of name-brand clothing, using maps to explore students’ communities and ways in which they could experience nature close to home, and facilitating discussions around collective, community actions instead of focusing solely on individual ones.    Ultimately, I radically changed my perspective around urban education and changed the whole structure of my teaching style. I also committed to leaning harder into the science. I used the   to ground lesson plans in research-informed findings on carbon cycles, sustainability, and biodiversity. I even had the “  posted on the walls around my classroom.   Almost two decades later, both my personal career and the   have come a long way. I earned a degree in science education while in New York, then went on to earn a degree in environmental sciences and engineering with a focus on climate, and a subsequent degree focused on environmental education. Eventually I moved on from formal classroom teaching and took a position within the Integrated Climate Sciences Division in EPA’s Office of Research and Development. The   advances climate-focused initiatives that address urgent climate priorities expressed by EPA program, regional, state, and Tribal partners.  My work in the division is still education-based, as I am currently working on developing and executing the  , an environmental education workshop series for residents in a community that is consistently exposed to significant flooding. I also joined the Writing Team for the  . Being an author of this  , a document that guided my early career and life decisions, has been a true full-circle moment for me. Similarly to my personal and professional advancements since 2009, the latest version of the Climate Literacy Guide reflects advancements in the science – including physical and social sciences – with updates that incorporate Indigenous Knowledges, social and cultural contexts, the social sciences, climate solutions, and climate justice concepts.   I hope another teacher (maybe even a new teacher like I was!) might discover the updated Climate Literacy Guide and find it helpful. Although I felt like I had significant room to improve on my teaching style after that exchange with my former student, you can imagine my surprise when, the following year, she sought me out in the hallways to proudly tell me that she had put herself on a \"shopping budget.\" Needless to say, teachers have immense power to make an impact, no matter where they are in their own journey, and I hope this updated Climate Literacy Guide might be one more resource to help those important impacts take shape.   \n     \n     Research Outreach & Communications Specialist     Office of Research and Development   Jenna was a classroom science teacher for almost a decade in New York City and then North Carolina, and now works as a Research Outreach & Communications Specialist in the Integrated Climate Sciences Division within the Center for Public Health & Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development.

Please  . \n You might be surprised to learn that tens of millions of Americans rely on private wells for their drinking water. My grandfather's home in rural East Texas highlights a critical issue: The house, built over a century ago, likely contains lead components in its plumbing, specifically, pipes and fixtures that deliver water to the faucet. Lead exposure can largely go unnoticed until significant health issues arise, like hearing problems, slowed growth, anemia, among others. Water quality from private wells is not regulated by the EPA but may be regulated by state or local authorities. As an intern in the   at the EPA, I have learned about the serious health risks that lead exposure poses to children. I am particularly concerned about how many families lack awareness about the importance of testing well water, now that I know its quality is not federally regulated. Many people often assume that clear water is safe to drink. However, harmful contaminants may be present without visible signs. Lead can be present in drinking water without any noticeable changes in color or odor. It is the responsibility of private well owners to test their water for lead and to take appropriate measures to mitigate exposure. Understanding the risks associated with lead in drinking water is crucial, especially when considering its impact on children's health. There is no safe level of lead. Lead exposure is harmful at any age, but it poses a greater risk to young children, infants, and fetuses. The physical and behavioral effects of lead occur at lower exposure levels in children than in adults. A dose of lead that might have minimal effect on an adult can have significant consequences for a child. Lead poisoning can lead to both physical and behavioral issues, and these impacts can be long-lasting or even permanent. The health impacts of lead can vary significantly depending on the stage of life during which exposure occurs. Children can be exposed to lead from various sources in addition to private wells, including contaminated water from old pipes, playing in contaminated soil, inhaling dust from deteriorating paint, consuming food stored in lead-glazed pottery, and playing with toys containing lead. This widespread exposure underscores the urgent need for vigilance and prevention efforts to protect children's health and development. Children are especially at risk because they frequently put their hands and objects in their mouths, which can transfer lead from contaminated surfaces directly into their bodies. If you believe your child may have been exposed to lead, it is important to have them tested with a  Health impacts of lead on children include: In rare cases, high ingestion of lead can cause seizures, coma, and even death. Private well owners are responsible for delivering safe drinking water to their households. Testing is important because lead does not affect the taste, odor, or color of the water. The internal plumbing of a home may have old pipes, solders, and fixtures that are made with lead. Similarly, older homes may have well pumps or well casings with lead-containing parts. Naturally acidic or low-mineral content groundwater can corrode lead-containing materials and cause the lead to leach into the water. Homeowners with private wells should test their drinking water more frequently if they have children, elderly family members, or someone pregnant or nursing living at home. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that   through blood and breastfeeding mothers can expose their infants through breastmilk. For more recommendations on testing your water, visit EPA's   website. Under the  , the EPA is responsible for setting and enforcing standards for safe lead levels in public water systems. The EPA assigned a   (MCLG) of zero for lead in drinking water due to its toxicity even at low levels. EPA has set required treatment techniques (referred to as the   that regulate corrosivity of water because lead contamination is often due to corrosive water and its contact with lead pipes. The recent Lead and Copper Rule Improvement requires the replacement of lead pipes within ten years and more rigorous testing of drinking water. In private wells, these techniques are not required. EPA estimates that over 23 million households across the United States rely on private well water for drinking. There is no requirement for monitoring lead or other contaminants in  , as they are not federally regulated, and most states have limited regulations on private drinking water wells. Accordingly, it is important that households with private wells regularly test the quality of their drinking water. EPA has a   that can help determine if you have lead plumbing. All you need is a penny (or key) and a magnet. If you have a confirmed lead pipe, you should contact your water company or a licensed plumber for confirmation and replacement options. If you determine you have a lead pipe: As we observe   throughout October, it is crucial to take proactive steps to ensure the safety of our drinking water. Testing your private well for lead is an essential measure to protect the health of children in your home. If left untested, lead contamination in private wells can remain undetected, posing serious health risks, particularly to young children. I encourage you to initiate conversations with family and friends who rely on private wells, emphasizing the importance of regular testing for lead. Together, we can create a greater awareness and commitment to protecting children's health. \n     \n     Intern     Office of Children's Health Protection   Sara is currently completing her Master of Public Health with a concentration in Environmental Health Science and Policy at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

The collection and treatment of domestic sewage and wastewater is vital to public health and clean water. It is among the most important factors responsible for the general level of good health enjoyed in the United States. Sewers collect sewage and wastewater from homes, businesses, and industries and deliver it to wastewater treatment facilities before it is discharged to water bodies or land, or reused. NPDES permits establish discharge limits and conditions for discharges from municipal wastewater treatment facilities to waters of the United States. Resources for discharge requirements include: Historically, municipalities have used two major types of sewer systems. Combined sewers are designed to collect both sanitary sewage and stormwater runoff in a single-pipe system. These systems were designed to convey sewage and wastewater to a treatment plant during dry weather. Under wet weather conditions, these combined sewer systems would overflow during wet weather conditions when large amounts of stormwater would enter the system. State and local authorities generally have not allowed the construction of new combined sewers since the first half of the 20th century. The other major type of domestic sewer design is sanitary sewers (also known as separate sanitary sewers). Sanitary sewers are installed to collect wastewater only and do not provide widespread drainage for the large amounts of runoff from precipitation events. Sanitary sewers are typically built with some allowance for higher flows that occur when excess water enters the collection system during storm events. Sanitary sewers that are not watertight due to cracks, faulty seals, and/or improper connections can receive large amounts of infiltration and inflow (I/I) during wet weather. Large volumes of I/I can cause sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and/or operational problems at the wastewater treatment facility serving the collection system. In addition, sewage overflows can be caused by other problems such as blockages, equipment failures, broken pipes, or vandalism.  Resources for overflows and peak flows at treatment plants include: Significant increases in flow at wastewater treatment facilities caused by wet weather conditions can create operational challenges and potentially adversely affect treatment efficiency, reliability, and control of unit process operations at the treatment facility. The CSO policy encourages municipalities with combined sewers to maximize wet weather flows to the treatment plant in order to decrease uncontrolled overflows in the collection system. Resources for peak flows at wastewater treatment facilities include:"},

We provide support to various community initiatives such as EPA's   effort. We strive to interact directly with communities and work with them to address their environmental and health concerns to the best of our ability and within the scope of the Agency's authority. Region 2 also co-leads a Regional Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice (EJ RIWG) with the U.S. Health and Human Services based in New York. The EJ RIWG is a communities-based effort where federal partners come together to find creative solutions for some of the most economically- and environmentally-challenged areas in our region. . The EPA Mid Atlantic Region’s Environmental Justice (EJ) Program is managed by the Office of Communities, Tribes and Environmental Assessment (OCTEA). OCTEA continues to lead in the development of cumulative impact analysis through a transparent, data-driven process to identify public health and environmental issues that may impact communities. OCTEA works to build capacity both internally and externally in Region 3 through outreach and education, leading trainings, facilitating discussions, and participating in national work groups. OCTEA is the point of contact for community based organizations and other environmental justice stakeholders in Region 3. OCTEA also: . Barbara Okorn ( ) The Environmental Justice, Community Health and Environmental Review Division (EJCHERD) reports to the Regional Administrator and Deputy Regional Administrator. It plays a critical role in leading and coordinating the region’s environmental justice programs. The vision of EJCHERD’s Environmental Justice Coordination and Community Engagement Branch (EJCCEB) is to ensure that the citizens and communities who reside in the eight States and six Tribes in EPA Region 4, have equitable access to clean water, clean air, and clean land while analyzing and addressing disproportionate impacts including distribution of environmental burdens and benefits. The program focuses on communities of color, low-income communities, Indigenous peoples, and vulnerable, overburdened and/or disadvantaged communities. The eight States and six Tribes served are: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, as well as six federally recognized Tribes (i.e., Catawba Indian Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Poarch Band of Creek Indians, Seminole Tribe of Florida.) In addition to working with external stakeholders, EJCCEB works closely with the EPA Region 4 Divisions in their integration of environmental justice within their programs. The EJCCEB plays the following role while working internally with EPA Region 4 Divisions and/or with external stakeholders (i.e., States, Tribes, and Local Governments, community-based organizations, academia, non-profits, etc.): Advisory; Consultative; Convening; Collaborative; Training (internal & external partners) and Technical Assistance/Support. In addition, the EJCCEB now has an advisory role in supporting the EPA Region 4’s EJ Advisory Council comprised of senior managers. Learn more about Region 5’s Environmental Justice tools and resources.  November 18, 2024 Region 5’s Environmental Justice Program is located in the Tribal and Multimedia Programs Office, within the Office of the Regional Administrator. We work across Region 5’s programs, in collaboration with a wide range of partners and stakeholders. Our purpose is to make transformative progress in advancing environmental justice and equity at the Tribal, state, and local levels, through a whole-of-government approach that involves communities as authentic partners. . Region 5 works across all programs and divisions to advance and integrate environmental justice. (312) 353-4293 Region 5 works with state environmental agencies to advance environmental justice and equity. The Office of Environmental Justice, Tribal, and International Affairs works closely with communities to facilitate culturally sensitive communication, find solutions, or reduce environmental challenges. The Environmental Justice program’s goal is to ensure that all people are protected from disproportionate impacts of environmental hazards by working with and on behalf of impacted communities. Environmental Justice is about real people facing real problems and designing practical solutions to address challenging environmental issues. The environmental justice movement advocates programs that promote environmental protection within the context of sustainable development. The Environmental Justice program administers EJ Small Grants and EJ Collaborative Problem-Solving (CPS) Cooperative Agreement Program. . The primary focus of the Region 7 Environmental Justice Program is to ensure that, as a Region, we are fulfilling the mandate given in Executive Order 12898 on environmental justice. Fulfilling this mandate means ongoing efforts to both ensure that Region 7 is addressing environmental justice in all we do and ensure community awareness regarding environmental issues and the decision-making processes in areas which affect their daily lives. The program maintains its outreach and education activities where grants programs and Agency participation in community activities have produced tangible environmental benefits for low-income and minority communities. . Region 8’s environmental justice program is focused on ensuring that everyone in Region 8 has the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards, and equal access to the decision-making process to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn, and work. Region 8’s EJ Team works to advance environmental justice by supporting underserved communities through connecting with, supporting, building the capacity of, and leveraging resources from both internal and external partners. Region 8 is predominantly rural and home to traditionally disenfranchised and historically self-reliant communities including Tribal Nations and Indigenous Peoples, migrant farm workers, Hispanic communities, and rural low income communities. The Region 8 EJ Team’s principal focus areas are to effectively integrate environmental justice into the activities of EPA Region 8, build effective partnerships with external stakeholders, and respond to challenges faced by overburdened communities in the Region. . The following is an example of a key effort in Region 8 aimed at benefitting the Region’s communities with environmental justice concerns: EPA Region 9 supports programs and projects to help address adverse and disproportionate effects. Here you will find examples of the ways communities have used EPA funding to increase their capacity to improve their local environment. We have also provided a list of tools and resources that may be useful to environmental justice organizations and residents. Do you have a program-specific question about Environmental Justice? Check out the list of network members below and the EJ-related topics of interest they are knowledgeable about. If you don’t find what you’re looking for, please contact the EJ Coordinator. Region 10's environmental justice program works to integrate the principles of environmental justice throughout the four states of Idaho, Alaska, Oregon and Washington. This is accomplished through grantmaking, direct collaboration with communities and tribes, close coordination with states and other governmental agencies and participation with universities, research centers and other entities involved in extending the discourse on environmental justice. The program also prioritizes the integration of environmental justice within the Region 10 office through strategic planning, training and working across programs on the Agency’s core work of permitting, enforcement, Superfund and other functions. Region 10's environmental justice program is currently located in the Policy and Environmental Review Branch in the Office of the Regional Administrator.

Water quality trading is a market-based approach that states, tribes, and territories may wish to pursue as an effective means to attain water quality improvements. Water quality trading is an approach to control pollutants from multiple sources that collectively impact water quality conditions. When more stringent regulatory standards are put in place, water quality trading allows one source of pollution to control a pollutant at levels greater than required and sell \"credits\" to another source, which uses the credits to supplement their level of treatment in order to comply with regulatory requirements. Pollutant reductions achieved through water quality trading must result in water quality that is as good as—or better than—what would be achieved through treatment and must not create pollutant “hot spots.” Water quality trading can encourage private investment capital, provide additional resources for conservation, and serve as a catalyst for developing innovative, practical solutions for improving water quality at a lower cost. Water quality trading has had a critical role in implementing TMDLs and other water quality-based NPDES permit requirements. For example, many municipal wastewater treatment plants across the country are seeing more stringent nutrient limits in their permits. Traditionally, those facilities would have to pay for new treatment technologies at the plant to meet the new limits. Water quality trading can allow facilities subject to strict requirements to purchase nutrient reductions from other treatment plants, farms, or other nutrient sources to achieve the same or better water quality outcome at a lower cost.  Water quality trading can provide greater flexibility on the timing and level of technology a facility might install, reduce overall compliance costs, and encourage voluntary participation of nonpoint sources within the watershed. Nonpoint source projects (e.g., streamside buffers, conservation tillage) installed as part of a water quality trade can provide other environmental benefits, such as reducing carbon emissions, reducing flood potential, stabilizing streambanks and providing wildlife habitat."},

EPA partners with more than 50 data contributors from various government agencies, academic institutions, and other U.S and international organizations to compile a key set of indicators related to the causes and effects of climate change. Explore the questions and answers below to learn more about the indicators. One important way to track and communicate the causes and effects of climate change is through the use of indicators. An indicator represents the state or trend of certain environmental or societal conditions over a given area and a specified period of time. EPA's indicators are designed to help readers understand observed long-term trends related to the causes and effects of climate change. In other words, they provide important evidence of \"what climate change looks like.\" For example, long-term measurements of   are used as an indicator to track and better understand the effects of changes in the Earth's climate. EPA compiles these indicators with the primary goal of informing our understanding of climate change. They are designed so that the public, scientists, analysts, decision-makers, educators, and others can use climate change indicators as a basis for: EPA publishes these indicators to make them accessible and available to use in a variety of ways. These indicators characterize observed changes from long-term records related to the causes and effects of climate change; the significance of these changes; and their possible consequences for people, the environment, and society. The indicators presented here do not cover all possible measures of the causes and effects of climate change, nor do they capture all possible climate change indicators found in the full body of scientific assessment literature. Instead, these indicators represent a wide-ranging set of high-quality, long-term data that show observed changes in the Earth’s climate system and several climate-relevant impacts. Together, these indicators present compelling evidence that climate change is happening now in the United States and globally. All of the indicators on this website relate to either the causes or the effects of climate change. Some indicators show trends that can be more directly linked to human-induced climate change than others. Collectively, the trends depicted in these indicators provide important evidence of \"what climate change looks like.\" Although each indicator has a connection to climate change, EPA's indicators do not attempt to identify either the extent to which a certain indicator is driving climate change, or the relative role of climate change in causing a trend in an observed indicator. Connections between human activities, climate change, and observed indicators are explored in more detail elsewhere in the scientific literature. For example, see the U.S. Global Change Research Program's  . Some indicators are directly linked to human activities that cause climate change, such as  . Changes depicted by other indicators, like  , have been confidently linked with the increase in greenhouse gases caused by human activity. Some of the trends in other indicators, such as  , are consistent with what one would expect in a warming climate but may also be influenced by limitations in the historical data or other factors in addition to climate change. A few indicators, like  , though known to be influenced by climate change, do not yet show any significant trend. In some cases, this could be because the period for which data are available or the geographic scale in which they are presented is limited. EPA partners with more than 50 data contributors from various U.S. and international government agencies, academic institutions, and other organizations to compile and communicate key indicators related to the causes and effects of climate change. EPA's indicators consist of peer-reviewed, publicly available data. In addition to being published on EPA's website, these data sets have been published in the scientific literature and in government and academic reports. Details on each underlying data set as well as where to find it are provided in the technical documentation on  . Trends relevant to climate change are best viewed at broad geographic scales and over long time periods. EPA's indicators are based on historical records that go back in time as far as possible without sacrificing data quality, so each indicator's time scale varies. Most of EPA's indicators focus on the United States. However, some include global trends to provide context or a basis for comparison, or because they are intrinsically global in nature, such as  . EPA attempts to present multiple scales (national, regional, or location-specific) in cases where the underlying data allow such scaling. The geographic extent and timeframe of each indicator largely depend on data availability and the nature of what is being measured. EPA also includes features such as “Community Connection” and “A Closer Look” (e.g.,  ) that focus on a particular region or localized area of interest to engage readers in particular areas or topics of interest within the United States. While the features and their underlying data are not national in scale or representative of broad geographic areas, these features are screened, developed, and documented in a manner consistent with other indicators. Although the climate is continually changing, not every climate change indicator shows a pattern of steady change over the period of record. The Earth is a complex system, and there are always natural variations from one year to the next—for example, a very warm year followed by a colder year. The Earth’s climate also goes through other natural cycles that play out over a period of several years or even decades. Individual years or even individual decades can deviate from the long-term trend. Human factors may also influence a trend—for example, human activities and land management practices can affect wildfire activity from year to year. EPA’s greenhouse-gas-related indicators focus on most of the major, well-mixed greenhouse gases that contribute to the vast majority of warming of the climate when they are emitted into the atmosphere. These major gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. Some of these gases are produced almost entirely by human activities, while others come from a combination of natural sources and human activities. Many of these major greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for tens to thousands of years after being released. They become globally mixed in the lower part of the atmosphere, called the troposphere (the first several miles above the Earth’s surface), reflecting the combined emissions worldwide from the past and present. Due to this global mixing, concentrations of these gases are fairly similar no matter where in the world they are measured. Other substances that have much shorter atmospheric lifetimes (i.e., less than a year) are still relevant to climate change. Important short-lived substances that affect the climate include water vapor, ozone in the troposphere, pollutants that lead to ozone formation, and aerosols (atmospheric particles) such as black carbon and sulfates. Water vapor, tropospheric ozone, and black carbon contribute to warming, while other aerosols produce a cooling effect. In addition to several long-lived greenhouse gases, EPA's   indicator tracks concentrations of ozone in the layers of the Earth's atmosphere, while Figure 2 of the   indicator shows the influence of a variety of short-lived substances. Indicators provide key information on changes that are occurring in our environment, like increasing temperatures or more severe extreme weather events, which can threaten people's health. Tracking changes in climate impacts and exposures improves understanding of changes in health risk, even if the actual health outcome is difficult to quantify. For example, while only some indicators exist for human health outcomes related to climate change, like  ,  ,  , and  , other indicators—like  ,  , or  —give insight into the changing risks to human health. There are many factors other than climate that affect human health; these are discussed in more detail in EPA's overview of  . EPA's climate change indicators are grouped into six categories: Each indicator can be accessed through the links above or directly from the   page.

EPA has published several summary reports of  , starting in 2010, then in 2012, 2014, 2016, and most recently, 2024. The online resource is updated periodically as new data become available, and thus may differ from the most recent reports and content. EPA's indicators are an example of a well-established, nationally relevant set of indicators representative of data from several of the federal agencies participating in the  .

While meeting these goals, modern electricity delivery systems can also be planned and managed to provide additional benefits, such as  . How the electricity delivery system is designed, operated, and managed is critical to achieving economic, reliability, and environmental benefits with a modern grid. Modern electricity delivery technologies may increase the energy efficiency of the overall electricity system by reducing energy losses along transmission and distribution lines and delivering higher quality electricity to industry, businesses, and homes. Electricity usage data from smart meters may be used to support other energy efficiency efforts and reduce consumption. Modernizing electricity delivery may also enable greater integration of renewable energy resources through changes to how grid operators manage and deploy resources such as storage or demand response during periods when renewable resources wane (e.g., when solar production decreases due to cloud cover). Integrating renewable energy resources can provide environmental benefits by avoiding the adverse environmental effects from other  . The environmental benefits of modernizing electricity delivery are expected to outweigh the negative effects. Possible environmental concerns include: Advanced (“smart”) meters transmit data using radio-frequency waves, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation. However, the radiation given off by a smart meter is similar in type and strength to the radiation from other common consumer devices.  ."},

The electric power grid operates based on a delicate balance between supply (generation) and demand (consumer use). One way to help balance fluctuations in electricity supply and demand is to store electricity during periods of relatively high production and low demand, then release it back to the electric power grid during periods of lower production or higher demand. In some cases, storage may provide economic, reliability, and environmental benefits. Depending on the extent to which it is deployed, electricity storage could help the utility grid operate more efficiently, reduce the likelihood of brownouts during peak demand, and allow for more renewable resources to be built and used. Energy can be stored in a variety of ways, including: In addition to these technologies, new technologies are currently under development, such as flow batteries, supercapacitors, and superconducting magnetic energy storage. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the United States had more than 25 gigawatts of electrical energy storage capacity as of March 2018. Of that total, 94 percent was in the form of pumped hydroelectric storage, and most of that pumped hydroelectric capacity was installed in the 1970s. The six percent of other storage capacity is in the form of battery, thermal storage, compressed air, and flywheel, as shown in the following graph: Storing electricity can provide indirect environmental benefits. For example, electricity storage can be used to help integrate more renewable energy into the electricity grid. Electricity storage can also help generation facilities operate at optimal levels, and reduce use of less efficient generating units that would otherwise run only at peak times. Further, the added capacity provided by electricity storage can delay or avoid the need to build additional power plants or transmission and distribution infrastructure. Potential negative impacts of electricity storage will depend on the type and efficiency of storage technology. For example, batteries use raw materials such as lithium and lead, and they can present environmental hazards if they are not disposed of or recycled properly. In addition, some electricity is wasted during the storage process."},

Below are answers to some frequently asked questions about climate change. For information about evidence of climate change, the greenhouse effect, and the human role in climate change, please see  . On this page: \"Weather\" refers to the day-to-day state of the atmosphere such as the combination of temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, and other factors. \"Climate\" describes the weather of a place averaged over a period of time, often 30 years. Think about it this way: climate is something that can be expected to happen in general, like a cold winter season, whereas weather is what a person might experience on any given day, like a snowstorm in January or a sunny day in July. Climate change involves significant changes in average conditions—such as temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other aspects of climate—that occur over years, decades, centuries, or longer. Climate change involves longer-term trends, such as shifts toward warmer, wetter, or drier conditions. These trends can be caused by natural variability in climate over time, as well as   that add   to the atmosphere like burning fossil fuels for energy. The terms \"global warming\" and \"climate change\" are sometimes used interchangeably, but global warming is just one of the ways in which climate is affected by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. \"Global warming\" describes the recent   near the earth's surface, which is caused mostly by   (such as carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere from   such as burning fossil fuels for energy. Climate change occurs over a long period of time, typically over decades or longer. In contrast, climate variability includes changes that occur within shorter timeframes, such as a month, season, or year. Climate variability explains the natural variability within the system. For example, one unusually cold or wet year followed by an unusually warm or dry year would not be considered a sign of climate change. Even though the planet is warming, some areas may be experiencing extra cold or snowy winters. These cold spells are due to variability in local weather patterns, which sometimes lead to colder-than-average seasons or even colder-than-average years at the local or regional level. In fact, a warmer climate traps more water vapor in the air, which may lead to   in some areas. As long as it is still cold enough to snow, a warming climate can lead to bigger snowstorms. Yes. Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that people are contributing significantly to today’s climate change, primarily by releasing excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy, cultivating crops, raising livestock, and clearing forests. The , which represents the work of hundreds of leading experts in climate science,   that \"it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.” The  , developed by the U.S. Global Change Research Program—which is composed of 13 federal scientific agencies—concluded that scientific evidence consistently points to human activities, rather than natural climate trends, as the “dominant cause” behind the rapid global temperature increase of 1.8°F from 1901 to 2016 (see Figure 1). Hundreds of independent and governmental scientific organizations have released similar statements, both in the United States and worldwide, including the  , the  , and the  . The earth does go through natural cycles of warming and cooling caused by   such as changes in the sun or volcanic activity. For example, there were times in the distant past when the earth was warmer than it is now. However, natural variations in climate do not explain today’s climate change.   has been caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases that come from a variety of activities, including burning fossil fuels. A degree or two change in average global temperature might not sound like much to worry about, but relatively small changes in the earth’s average temperature can mean   in local and regional climate, creating risks to  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Among the many examples cited by the   are an increase in heat waves and days with temperatures above 90°F; more extreme weather events such as storms, droughts, and floods; and a projected sea level rise of 1 to 4 feet by the end of this century, which could put certain areas of the country underwater. Climate change poses many threats to people’s health and well-being. Among the health impacts cited by the   are the following: See EPA’s   website for more information about the effects of climate change in the United States. Everyone will be affected by climate change, but some people may be more affected than others. Among the most vulnerable people are those in overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed communities. Three key factors influence a person’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change: In addition, there is a wide range of other factors that influence people’s vulnerability. For example, people with less access to healthcare, adequate housing, and financial resources are less likely to rebound from climate disasters. People who are excluded from planning processes, experience racial and ethnic discrimination, or have language barriers are also more vulnerable to and less able to prepare for and avoid the risks of climate change. . People can reduce the risks of climate change by   that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and by preparing for the changes expected in the future. Decisions that people make today will shape the world for decades and even centuries to come. Communities can also prepare for the changes in the decades ahead by identifying and reducing their vulnerabilities and  . Such actions can ensure that the  —such as young children, older adults, and people living in poverty—are protected from the health and safety threats of climate change. The longer people wait to act on climate change, the more damaging its effects will become on the planet and people’s health. If people fail to take action soon, more drastic and costly measures to prevent greenhouse gases from exceeding dangerous levels could be needed later. The most recent   found that global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could avoid tens of thousands of deaths per year in the United States by the end of the century, as well as billions of dollars in damages related to water shortages, wildfires, agricultural losses, flooding, and other impacts. There are many   that people can take now to help reduce the risk of climate change while also improving the natural environment, community infrastructure and transportation systems, and overall health."},

Since the Industrial Revolution,   have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other   into the atmosphere, which has changed the earth’s climate. Natural processes, such as changes in the sun's energy and volcanic eruptions, also affect the earth's climate. However, they do not explain the warming that we have observed over the last century. Scientists have pieced together a record of the earth’s climate by analyzing a number of indirect measures of climate, such as ice cores, tree rings, glacier lengths, pollen remains, and ocean sediments, and by studying changes in the earth’s orbit around the sun.  This record shows that the climate varies naturally over a wide range of time scales, but this variability does not explain the observed warming since the 1950s. Rather, it is extremely likely (> 95%) that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming. It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Human activities have contributed substantially to climate change through: Concentrations of the   have all increased since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide   are now more abundant in the earth’s atmosphere than any time in the last 800,000 years.  These greenhouse gas emissions have increased the   and  . Burning fossil fuels changes the climate more than any other human activity.  In recent years, human activities have released around 35 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year.    have increased by more than 40 percent since pre-industrial times, from approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) in the 18th century  to 419 ppm in 2023.  Human activities increased methane concentrations during most of the 20th century to more than 2.5 times the pre-industrial level, from approximately 722 parts per billion (ppb) in the 18th century  to 1,922 ppb in 2023.  Nitrous oxide concentrations have risen approximately 20 percent since the start of the Industrial Revolution, with a relatively rapid increase toward the end of the 20th century. Nitrous oxide concentrations have increased from a pre-industrial level of 270 ppb to 337 ppb in 2023. Activities such as agriculture, road construction, and deforestation can change the reflectivity of the earth's surface, leading to local warming or cooling. This effect is observed in  , which are urban centers that are warmer than the surrounding, less populated areas. One reason that these areas are warmer is that buildings, pavement, and roofs tend to reflect less sunlight than natural surfaces. While deforestation can increase the earth’s reflectivity globally by replacing dark trees with lighter surfaces such as crops, the net effect of all land-use changes appears to be a small cooling. Emissions of small particles, known as aerosols, into the air can also lead to reflection or absorption of the sun's energy. Many types of air pollutants undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere to create aerosols. Overall, human-generated aerosols have a net cooling effect on the earth. Learn more about human-generated and natural  . Natural processes are always influencing the earth’s climate and can explain climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s. However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone. Changes in the earth’s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet’s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.  At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11°F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2°F warmer than it is today. Changes in the sun’s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth’s surface. While these changes can influence the earth’s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.  Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun’s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen. The amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth’s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed. Natural changes in the earth’s surface, like the  , have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as   to other processes. Volcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO ) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.  These particles are an example of cooling  . Volcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year. Over the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.  The heating or cooling of the earth’s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.  These changing concentrations have acted as a positive  , amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth’s orbit.                              "},

Learn about some of the key concepts related to climate change: The earth's climate is changing. Multiple lines of evidence show changes in our weather, oceans, and ecosystems, such as: These changes are due to a buildup of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and the warming of the planet due to the greenhouse effect. The earth's temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving the planet’s system. When sunlight reaches the earth’s surface, it can either be reflected back into space or absorbed by the earth. Incoming energy that is absorbed by the earth warms the planet. Once absorbed, the planet releases some of the energy back into the atmosphere as heat (also called infrared radiation). Solar energy that is reflected back to space does not warm the earth. Certain gases in the atmosphere absorb energy, slowing or preventing the loss of heat to space. Those gases are known as “greenhouse gases.” They act like a blanket, making the earth warmer than it would otherwise be. This process, commonly known as the “greenhouse effect,” is natural and necessary to support life. However, the recent buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities has changed the earth's climate and resulted in dangerous effects to human health and welfare and to ecosystems. Most of the   has been caused by human  .  Greenhouse gases come from a variety of  , including burning fossil fuels for heat and energy, clearing forests, fertilizing crops, storing waste in landfills, raising livestock, and producing some kinds of industrial products. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to recent climate change. Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels, solid waste, trees, and other biological materials, and as a result of certain chemical reactions, such as cement manufacturing. Carbon dioxide is absorbed and emitted naturally as part of the carbon cycle, through plant and animal respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange. The carbon cycle is the process by which carbon continually moves from the atmosphere to the earth and then back to the atmosphere. On the earth, carbon is stored in rocks, sediments, the ocean, and in living organisms. Carbon is released back into the atmosphere when plants and animals die, as well as when fires burn, volcanoes erupt, and fossil fuels (such as coal, natural gas, and oil) are combusted. The carbon cycle ensures there is a balanced concentration of carbon in the different reservoirs on the planet. But a change in the amount of carbon in one reservoir affects all the others. Today, people are disturbing the carbon cycle by burning fossil fuels, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and through land use changes that remove plants, which absorb carbon from the atmosphere. \n Both natural and human activities produce methane. For example, natural wetlands, agricultural activities, and fossil fuel extraction and transport all emit methane. Nitrous oxide is produced mainly through agricultural activities and natural biological processes. Fossil fuel burning and industrial processes also create nitrous oxide. Chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride, together called  , are often used in coolants, foaming agents, fire extinguishers, solvents, pesticides, and aerosol propellants. Different greenhouse gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. In addition, some gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer. Learn more about  , a measure of climate impacts based on how long each greenhouse gas remains in the atmosphere and how strongly it absorbs energy.  is created by a chemical reaction between emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from automobiles, power plants, and other industrial and commercial sources in the presence of sunlight. In addition to trapping heat, ground-level ozone is a pollutant that can cause respiratory health problems and damage crops and ecosystems. Water vapor is another greenhouse gas and plays a key role in   because of its heat-trapping ability. Warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air. Therefore, as greenhouse gas concentrations increase and global temperatures rise, the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere also increases, further amplifying the warming effect. For more information on greenhouse gases, see  . Aerosols in the atmosphere can affect climate. Aerosols are microscopic (solid or liquid) particles that are so small that instead of quickly falling to the surface like larger particles, they remain suspended in the air for days to weeks. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and biomass, contribute to emissions of these substances, although some aerosols also come from natural sources such as volcanoes and marine plankton. Unlike greenhouse gases, the climate effects of aerosols vary depending on what they are made of and where they are emitted. Depending on their color and other factors, aerosols can either absorb or reflect sunlight. Aerosols that reflect sunlight, such as particles from volcanic eruptions or sulfur emissions from burning coal, have a cooling effect. Those that absorb sunlight, such as black carbon (a part of soot), have a warming effect. Not only can black carbon directly absorb incoming and reflected sunlight, but it can also absorb infrared radiation.  Black carbon can also be deposited on snow and ice, darkening the surface and thereby increasing the snow's absorption of sunlight and accelerating melt. For more information, see the  . While reductions in all aerosols can lead to more warming, targeted reductions in black carbon emissions can reduce global warming. Warming and cooling aerosols can also interact with clouds, changing their ability to form and dissipate, as well as their reflectivity and precipitation rates. Clouds can contribute both to cooling, by reflecting sunlight, and warming, by trapping outgoing heat. Climate feedbacks are natural processes that respond to global warming by offsetting or further increasing change in the climate system. Feedbacks that offset the change in climate are called negative feedbacks. Feedbacks that amplify changes are called positive feedbacks.  appears to cause the most important positive feedback. As the earth warms, the rate of evaporation and the amount of water vapor in the air both increase. Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this leads to further warming. \n \n\n The melting of Arctic   is another example of a positive climate feedback. As temperatures rise, sea ice retreats. The loss of ice exposes the underlying sea surface, which is darker and absorbs more sunlight than ice, increasing the total amount of warming. Less   during warm winters has a similar effect. \n \n\n  can have both warming and cooling effects on climate. They cool the planet by reflecting sunlight during the day, and they warm the planet by slowing the escape of heat to space (this is most apparent at night, as cloudy nights are usually warmer than clear nights). Climate change can lead to changes in the coverage, altitude, and reflectivity of clouds. These changes can then either amplify (positive feedback) or dampen (negative feedback) the original change. The net effect of these changes is likely an amplifying, or positive, feedback due mainly to increasing altitude of high clouds in the tropics, which makes them better able to trap heat, and reductions in coverage of lower-level clouds in the mid-latitudes, which reduces the amount of sunlight they reflect. The magnitude of this feedback is uncertain due to the complex nature of cloud/climate interactions.  "},

The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter 1972, also called the London Convention, and the 1996 London Protocol are international treaties that provide an international standard and framework for countries to individually and collectively protect and preserve our oceans from pollution caused by the dumping of wastes and other matter into the ocean. Effective implementation of the London Convention and London Protocol helps preserve biological diversity and contributes to higher productivity of ocean resources and improved fisheries. Healthy coastal and ocean environments support tourism, recreation and commerce. Successful treaty implementation also promotes better waste management strategies to prioritize re-use and recycling and foster innovations to reduce waste generation and thus the need for waste disposal.  In the United States, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) implements the requirements of the London Convention.  On this page: From the 1950s to 1970s, the United States and other countries became increasingly concerned about the environmental impacts of human activities on the marine environment, including the uncontrolled disposal of wastes into the ocean. The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter of 1972, known as the London Convention, is one of the first international agreements for the protection of the marine environment from human activities. The London Convention addresses the deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms and other man-made structures at sea, as well as to the deliberate disposal at sea of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures themselves. Contracting Parties to the London Convention agreed to control dumping by implementing regulatory programs to assess the need for, and the potential impact of, dumping. The London Convention requires that Contracting Parties issue a permit for the dumping of wastes and other matter at sea and generally prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials. Over time, Contracting Parties to the London Convention have amended the treaty by banning ocean dumping of certain wastes and by promoting pollution prevention and better waste management. The London Convention entered into force on August 30, 1975. As of September 2024, there are 87 Contracting Parties to the London Convention.  The United States is a Contracting Party to the London Convention. The United States ratified the London Convention on April 29, 1974. The London Convention entered into force on August 30, 1975. In 1996, Contracting Parties to the London Convention concluded negotiations toward a new, free-standing treaty, referred to as the London Protocol, to modernize and eventually replace the London Convention. The London Protocol entered into force in 2006. As of September 2024, there are 54 Contracting Parties to the London Protocol. The United States is not a Contracting Party.  The London Protocol is intended to be more comprehensive in protecting the marine environment than the London Convention. Both define dumping to include the deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms, and other man-made structures at sea, as well as deliberate disposal at sea of those objects. The London Protocol definition includes any storage of wastes or other matter in the seabed and the subsoil, as well as the abandonment of structures at sea and any abandonment or toppling at sea of platforms or other man-made structures at sea, for the sole purpose of deliberate disposal. Under the London Protocol, dumping of all wastes and other materials is prohibited except the following materials listed in Annex I of the London Protocol (“the reverse list”), which may be considered for dumping: The United States is not a Contracting Party to the London Protocol. The United States signed the London Protocol in 1998 but has not ratified the treaty. Though the United States has not yet ratified the London Protocol, the United States already implements most provisions of the London Protocol through the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act. Through the London Convention and London Protocol, the United States works with many others to reduce and prevent pollution caused by ocean dumping. Great progress has been made towards the protection of the marine environment due to the active participation of Contracting Parties and their willingness to work together to solve problems related to the control of waste disposal into the ocean. The United States actively participates in the annual Consultative Meeting of Contracting Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol. Among other things, the United States’ participation includes: The Department of State leads the United States delegation to the annual Consultative Meeting and is supported by the EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Navy (Navy), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Department of Energy (DOE), and Department of Interior (DOI). The United States is also an active participant in the annual joint meetings of the London Convention Scientific Group and London Protocol Scientific Group. The Scientific Groups are responsible for providing scientific and technical advice on ocean dumping and marine pollution to the Consultative Meeting. The EPA leads the United States delegation and is supported by the State Department, USACE, NOAA, Navy, USCG, DOE and DOI. As a historical leader in ocean science, the United States’ participation in the science groups helps assure that treaty implementation is guided by the sound science supported by the United States’ scientific expertise. London Convention and London Protocol Contracting Parties are required to submit an annual Ocean Dumping Report to the Secretariat for the London Convention and London Protocol at the   (IMO). The IMO is a United Nations specialized agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution from ships The EPA and USACE together develop and submit the annual report for the United States which describes the types and amounts of materials permitted under the MPRSA, permit compliance monitoring, and ocean site monitoring. Contracting Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol have developed international guidance (or guidelines) to assist national authorities responsible for regulating ocean dumping in meeting their treaty obligations. The guidelines contain step-by-step procedures to evaluate wastes and other matter being considered for ocean dumping, including waste prevention audits, assessment of alternatives to ocean dumping, waste characterization, assessment of potential adverse environmental effects of dumping, disposal site selection, and monitoring and permitting procedures. Specific guidelines exist for the assessment of the materials listed in Annex I of the London Protocol. This   is available on the IMO website, and the publications can be obtained from  . The London Convention and London Protocol prohibit the dumping of wastes with more than   levels of radioactivity. Contracting Parties to the London Convention have developed guidance for evaluating materials to determine if they contain   levels of radionuclides. In addition, Contracting Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol have developed guidances for monitoring, for the selection and management of ocean sites for the disposal of materials, for sampling and analysis of dredged material, to assist countries with limited experience in regulating ocean dumping, and to share best practices in protecting the marine environment. London Convention and London Protocol Contracting Parties have also developed advice for: Contracting Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol have taken steps to address potential harm to the marine environment from novel technologies designed to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or mitigate its adverse effects. Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol have been working to address sub-seabed sequestration of carbon dioxide, which is a climate change mitigation technique that stores carbon dioxide in geologic formations under the ocean floor. The process involves capturing carbon dioxide from industrial and energy-related sources, transporting that carbon dioxide offshore, and sequestering the carbon dioxide into an appropriate sub-seabed formation. The aim is to store the carbon dioxide within these geological formations permanently in order to mitigate the warming effects from excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The risks of carbon dioxide leaking out of the geologic formation should be minimized to avoid any potential impacts to human health or the marine environment. In 2006, Contracting Parties to the London Protocol adopted amendments to regulate the sequestration of carbon dioxide in sub-seabed geological formations under the treaty. Contracting Parties have developed guidance to address the risks posed by carbon dioxide sequestration in sub-seabed geological formations and potential effects on the marine environment. In 2009, London Protocol Contracting Parties adopted an amendment to allow the export of carbon dioxide streams for sequestration of carbon dioxide in sub-seabed geological formations provided that an agreement or arrangement has been entered into by the countries concerned (Resolution LP.3(4)). The amendment has not entered into force. In 2019, London Protocol Contracting Parties adopted Resolution LP.5(14), agreeing to allow provisional application of the 2009 amendment pending its entry into force. Since 2007, the Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol have been working to establish a global, transparent, and effective regulatory mechanism for ocean fertilization and other marine geoengineering activities that fall within the scope of the London Convention and London Protocol. Learn more about ocean fertilization, other marine geoengineering techniques, and U.S. permitting of certain marine geoengineering activities for   and   under the MPRSA. In 2023, the Scientific Groups of the London Convention and London Protocol determined that the four marine geoengineering techniques under evaluation have the potential to cause deleterious effects that are widespread, long-lasting, or severe. The Scientific Groups agreed that they should continue to monitor this topic and carry out further work to enable the London Convention and Protocol Parties to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions, including potential further regulation. The Scientific Groups also convened a “Science Day” symposium focused on emerging technologies in marine geoengineering.   on the International Maritime Organization website. At the 2023 Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the London Convention and London Protocol, the Parties issued a   that: 1) reiterated concern about marine engineering techniques, which have the potential for deleterious effects that are widespread, long-lasting, or severe, 2) noted the need to carefully assess potential marine geoengineering activities, and 3) urged that, given risks and uncertainties, marine geoengineering activities other than legitimate scientific research, should be deferred. More information on the London Convention and London Protocol work related to marine geoengineering is provided on the International Maritime Organization website: Mariners or other persons who observe dumping incidents in ocean waters that could be violations of the London Convention and Protocol are encouraged to report these events as follows: Additional information and resources about the London Convention and London Protocol are available through the  's website."},

This illustrated booklet covers all major sources of pollution such as: Includes a glossary and a list of sources for additional information. Written in easy-to-understand language for the general consumer. Coauthored by EPA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This brochure provides quick and simple overview of some key indoor air pollutants including radon, secondhand smoke, asthma triggers, volatile organic compounds, molds and combustion pollutants. The brochure unfolds into a poster that features action steps to improving indoor air. This booklet is intended to help people who work in office buildings learn about the factors that contribute to indoor air quality and comfort problems and the roles of building managers and occupants in maintaining a good indoor environment. Because good indoor air quality depends on the actions of everyone in the building, a partnership between building management and occupants is the best way to maintain a healthy and productive work space. This longer technical guide focuses on air cleaners for residential use; it does not address air cleaners used in large or commercial structures such as office buildings, schools, large apartment buildings, or public buildings. In addition to providing general information about the types of pollutants affected by air cleaners, this document discusses the types of air-cleaning devices and technologies available, metrics that can be used to compare air-cleaning devices, the effectiveness of air-cleaning devices in removing indoor air pollutants, and information from intervention studies on the effects that air cleaners can have on health and on health markers. This short consumer guide covers portable air cleaners and furnace or HVAC filters used in a home. It includes tips for selecting a portable air cleaner, furnace filter, or HVAC filter. This publication is intended to help consumers answer this often confusing question. The guide explains what air duct cleaning is, provides guidance to help consumers decide whether to have the service performed in their home, and provides helpful information for choosing a duct cleaner, determining if duct cleaning was done properly, and how to prevent contamination of air ducts. The Building Air Quality, developed by the EPA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, provides practical suggestions on preventing, identifying and resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) problems in public and commercial buildings. This guidance provides information on factors affecting indoor air quality; describes how to develop an IAQ profile of building conditions and create an IAQ management plan; describes investigative strategies to identify causes of IAQ problems; and provides criteria for assessing alternative mitigation strategies, determining whether a problem has been resolved, and deciding whether to consult outside technical specialists. Other topics included in the guide are key problem causing factors; air quality sampling; heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems; moisture problems; and additional sources of information. The Building Air Quality Action Plan (BAQ Action Plan) meets the needs of building owners and managers who want an easy-to-understand path for taking their building from current conditions and practices to the successful institutionalization of good IAQ management practices. It emphasizes changing how you operate and maintain your building, not increasing the amount of work or cost of maintaining your building. The BAQ Action Plan follows 8 logical steps and includes a 100-item Checklist that is designed to help verify implementation of the Action Plan. The  , addresses the future of indoor environmental quality. In preparing  , EPA sought the advice of many, both within the Agency and outside, to develop the vision, goals, guiding principles and potential actions presented in the report.   lays out a blueprint by which agencies and individuals across the country, and around the world, can focus their efforts towards improvements in the indoor environment and health. Assists health professionals (especially the primary care physician) in diagnosis of patient symptoms that could be related to an indoor air pollution problem. Addresses the health problems that may be caused by contaminants encountered daily in the home and office. Organized according to pollutant or pollutant groups such as environmental tobacco smoke, VOCs, biological pollutants and sick building syndrome, this booklet lists key signs and symptoms from exposure to these pollutants, provides a diagnostic checklist and quick reference summary, and includes suggestions for remedial action. Also includes references for information contained in each section.

Know what precautions to take when using foggers or misters to apply pesticides, sanitizers, disinfectants, or other chemicals indoors. You can’t see or smell carbon monoxide, but at high levels it can kill a person in minutes. Carbon monoxide (CO) is produced whenever any the following fuels are burned: If appliances that burn fuel are maintained and used properly, the amount of CO produced is usually not hazardous. However, if appliances are not working properly or are used incorrectly, dangerous levels of CO can result. Hundreds of people die accidentally every year from CO poisoning caused by malfunctioning or improperly used fuel-burning appliances. Even more die from CO produced by idling cars. Fetuses, infants, elderly people and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be especially susceptible. Be safe. Practice the DO’s and DON’Ts of carbon monoxide.  The Carbon Monoxide fact sheet has also been translated into Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean. This fact sheet contains basic information on flood cleanup with illustrations and links to more detailed information  (PDF) Written for general audiences, this fact sheet provides accurate information regarding the use of ozone-generating devices in indoor occupied spaces. This information is based on the most credible scientific evidence currently available. Whether in its pure form or mixed with other chemicals, ozone can be harmful to health.

The information provided here is based on current scientific and technical understanding of the issues presented. Following the advice given will not necessarily provide complete protection in all situations or against all health hazards that may be caused by indoor air pollution. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. . Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate. It is particularly important to take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants — for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or engaging in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might also choose to do some of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather permits. Advanced designs of new homes are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). Ventilation and shading can help control indoor temperatures. Ventilation also helps remove or dilute indoor airborne pollutants coming from indoor sources. This reduces the level of contaminants and improves indoor air quality (IAQ). Carefully evaluate using ventilation to reduce indoor air pollutants where there may be outdoor sources of pollutants, such as smoke or refuse, nearby. The introduction of outdoor air is one important factor in promoting good air quality. Air may enter a home in several different ways, including: Infiltration occurs in all homes to some extent. Natural ventilation describes air movement through open windows and doors. If used properly natural ventilation can at times help moderate the indoor air temperature, which may become too hot in homes without air-conditioning systems or when power outages or brownouts limit or make the use of air conditioning impossible. Natural ventilation can also improve indoor air quality by reducing pollutants that are indoors. Examples of natural ventilation are: Most residential forced air-heating systems and air-conditioning systems do not bring outdoor air into the house mechanically, and infiltration and natural ventilation are relied upon to bring outdoor air into the home. Advanced designs for new homes are starting to add a mechanical feature that brings outdoor air into the home through the HVAC system. Some of these designs include energy efficient heat recovery ventilators to mitigate the cost of cooling and heating this air during the summer and winter. There are many types and sizes of air cleaners on the market, ranging from relatively inexpensive table-top models to sophisticated and expensive whole-house systems. Some air cleaners are highly effective at particle removal, while others, including most table-top models, are much less so. Air cleaners are generally not designed to remove gaseous pollutants. A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions. Another important factor in determining the effectiveness of an air cleaner is the strength of the pollutant source. Table-top air cleaners, in particular, may not remove satisfactory amounts of pollutants from strong nearby sources. People with a sensitivity to particular sources may find that air cleaners are helpful only in conjunction with concerted efforts to remove the source. Over the past few years, there has been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants remove significant quantities of pollutants in homes and offices. Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered because overly damp soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals. At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain because they only partially remove the radon decay products and do not diminish the amount of radon entering the home. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a reliable means of reducing the health risk from radon."},

Simply scan the QR codes to access the resources.  . During a wildfire, smoke can make the outdoor air unhealthy to breathe. Local officials may advise you to stay indoors during a smoke event. You should be aware that some of the smoke from outdoors can enter your home and make it unhealthy to breathe indoor air, too. If you are close to a wildfire, the fire itself, as well as heavy smoke and ash, can pose serious, immediate risks to your safety and health. You and your family should be prepared to evacuate immediately if told to do so. Farther from a wildfire, you may be exposed to smoke even if the fire itself is far away. Smoke is made up of a complex mixture of gases and fine particles produced when wood and other organic materials burn. The biggest health threat from smoke is from fine particles. These microscopic particles can get into your eyes and respiratory system – whether you are outdoors or indoors, where they can cause health problems such as burning eyes, runny nose, and illnesses such as bronchitis. Fine particles also can aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases - and even are linked to premature deaths in people with these conditions.  If you are healthy, you're usually not at a major risk from short-term exposures to smoke. Still, it's a good idea to avoid breathing smoke – both outdoors and indoors – if you can help it. Learn more about the  . This page provides helpful information to reduce your exposure to wildfire smoke inside your home. Outdoor air, including fine particles from wildfire smoke, can enter your home in a few ways: Wildfire smoke could impact your indoor air quality (IAQ) differently depending on the proximity of the fire and the density of the smoke. Here are some situations you might experience and the actions you can take in each situation: It may be best to evacuate. Fires can spread quickly, and the smoke plume can make it difficult to see in an evacuation. In addition, it can be nearly impossible to keep dense smoke from building up in the indoor air. Pay close attention to local emergency alerts to know when to evacuate. Smoke may enter your home, making it harder to breathe. Learn more about   in this situation and   for it. If there is an active fire in your area, follow your local news, EPA's    website, or your state air quality website for up-to-date information. While this can happen, the amount of smoke that may reach your community from such a distance is probably very small and may be overshadowed by local sources of particle pollution. In this situation, you can monitor your local outdoor air quality on   and   as you normally would. If you live in an area where the wildfire risk is high, take steps now to prepare for fire season. Being prepared for fire season is especially important for the health of children, older adults, and people with heart or lung disease. The   fact sheet describes the key steps you should take to make sure you are prepared to protect your family’s health in the event of a wildfire.   provides additional detail on how to protect yourself and your property. You may decide to purchase a portable air cleaner or high-efficiency HVAC system filter as part of your preparation in order to help improve your indoor air quality during a wildfire smoke event. If you decide to purchase a  , choose one that is sized for the room in which you will use it. Make sure the portable air cleaner does not make ozone. If portable air cleaners are not available or affordable, you may choose to use a  . DIY air cleaners are made by attaching a furnace filter to a box fan with tape, brackets, or a bungee cord, and can serve as a temporary alternative to commercial air cleaners. At this time, there is limited data available on how well DIY air cleaners filter smoke particles.  . There are many ways to put together a DIY air cleaner. Some common designs are to place one filter flat against the fan, two filters taped with cardboard to form a triangle against the fan, or even more filters taped against the fan to form a cube. The Washington Department of Ecology and Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation have posted tutorial videos to help users construct DIY air cleaners:   and  . To maximize filtration, choose a high-efficiency filter, preferably rated Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) 13 or higher, and align the arrows on the filter with the direction of the air flow through the fan. Try to get a good seal between the fan and the filter. If you use a DIY air cleaner, follow these safety tips: If you decide to purchase a   to increase filtration, choose one with a MERV 13 rating, or as high a rating as your system fan and filter slot can accommodate. You may need to consult a professional HVAC technician to determine the highest efficiency filter that will work best for your system. You can find additional information about portable air cleaners and HVAC filters in the   fact sheet and  . EPA is also conducting  ; the study webpage provides more information about this filtration option. It’s also a good idea to get familiar with your HVAC system or air conditioner system, if you have one, so you can adjust it to keep smoke out. You should also consider keeping a supply of N95 respirator masks on hand. You can often purchase these masks in hardware stores or drugstores. The   fact sheet and   will help you choose the correct mask and wear it effectively. When wildfires create smoky conditions, there are things you can do, indoors and out, to reduce your family's exposure to smoke. Reducing exposure to smoke is important for everyone’s health — especially children, older adults, and people with heart or lung disease. The   fact sheet describes what you can do. If local officials advise you to stay indoors, take these actions in your home to reduce your smoke exposure:  After the smoke clears, you may need to clean up ash or other debris left behind by the fire. The   fact sheet describes how you can protect yourself and your family and avoid getting ash in the indoor air while cleaning up. Children, older adults, and people with heart or lung diseases, such as asthma, should not participate in cleanup work. Cleanup work can expose you to ash and other products of the fire that may irritate your eyes, nose, or skin and cause coughing and other health effects. Wear gloves, long-sleeved shirts, long pants, shoes and socks to avoid skin contact with ash. Wear an N95 respirator to protect your lungs from breathing in ash. Change your shoes and clothing before you leave the cleanup site to avoid tracking ash offsite, into your car, or other places. To avoid tracking ash into clean indoor spaces, use doormats and clean them regularly. Remove shoes indoors when possible. Ash deposited on surfaces both indoors and outdoors can be inhaled if it becomes airborne when you clean up. Avoid stirring up or sifting through ash as much as you can. Avoid actions that kick ash particles up into the air, such as dry sweeping. Before sweeping indoor and outdoor hard surfaces, mist them with water to keep dust down. Follow with wet mopping. Use a damp cloth or wet mop on lightly dusted areas. When you wet down ash, use as little water as you can. If you choose to vacuum dusty surfaces, use a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-type vacuum.   You may consider having your air ducts cleaned after a fire, but EPA recommends that air ducts only be cleaned as needed. For example, you should consider having the ducts cleaned if you find that your ducts are clogged with excessive amounts of dust and debris and/or particles are actually released into your home from the supply registers.

Spread of COVID-19 occurs via airborne particles and droplets. People who are infected with COVID can release particles and droplets of respiratory fluids that contain the SARS CoV-2 virus into the air when they exhale (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing). The droplets or aerosol particles vary across a wide range of sizes – from visible to microscopic. Once infectious droplets and particles are exhaled, they move outward from the person (the source). These droplets carry the virus and transmit infection. Indoors, the very fine droplets and particles will continue to spread through the air in the room or space and can accumulate. Since COVID-19 is transmitted through contact with respiratory fluids carrying the infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus, a person can be exposed by an infected person coughing or speaking near them. They can also be exposed by inhaling aerosol particles that are spreading away from the infected person. Transmission of COVID-19 from inhalation of virus in the air can occur at distances greater than six feet. Particles from an infected person can move throughout an entire room or indoor space. The particles can also linger in the air after a person has left the room – they can remain airborne for hours in some cases. Someone can also be exposed via splashes and sprays of respiratory fluids directly onto their mucous membranes. Spread may also sometimes occur through contact with contaminated surfaces, though this route is now considered less likely. See   or ​  for technical information. Though the risk of infection by breathing in particles carrying the virus generally decreases with distance from infected people and with time, some circumstances increase the risk of infection: There are straightforward steps that can be taken to reduce the potential for airborne transmission of COVID-19 and the focus of this material is on those measures. The layout and design of a building, as well as occupancy and type of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, can all impact potential airborne spread of the virus. The   is a call to action and a set of guiding principles and best practices to assist building owners and operators with reducing risks from airborne viruses and other contaminants indoors.  Although improvements to ventilation and air cleaning cannot on their own eliminate the risk of airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, EPA recommends increasing ventilation with outdoor air and air filtration as important components of a larger strategy that may include physical distancing, wearing face coverings or masks,  , handwashing, and other precautions.  Please supplement this information with the latest advice from state, local, Tribal and federal agencies."},

You can usually clean and dry materials that do not soak up water. You should throw away materials that soak up a lot of water and can’t be cleaned and dried. You may be able to save some fabrics and textiles by putting them through the laundry. If you have precious items that you want to preserve, a restoration specialist for that type of item may be able to clean and dry it.  Be sure to watch these videos to ensure you are safely sorting and discarding items and building materials: Find short how-to videos and other resources on  and   for more information about how to clean objects and surfaces after a flood.  Use cleaning methods that keep contaminants from getting into the air. Avoid stirring up dust or scrubbing surfaces. The first time you clean a surface, clean it gently to remove loose dirt and microorganisms. Use a cloth (or something similar) dampened with clean water and detergent. After you have gently cleaned with something damp, you can use dry tools, like a wet/dry vacuum, to remove any remaining debris.  While cleaning, open doors and windows, if possible, to increase ventilation and help dry your home. If you can already see mold, wait to start up fans or dehumidifiers until after you’ve gently cleaned the mold you can see. This is so the fans do not spread the mold.  If you suspect that any part of your heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system was submerged or affected by the flood waters, see  First, you should use clean water and detergent to physically remove contaminants from surfaces. You can also use an EPA-registered   on some clean surfaces that do not absorb water to kill microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, and mold. It is important to understand that disinfectants and sanitizers should be used on surfaces that are clean. These products do not work on surfaces that have not been cleaned. Many of these products are not intended for use on surfaces that absorb water like fabrics or unfinished wood. Some disinfectants, sanitizers, and other cleaning products may cause breathing problems or skin irritation. Before you use a product,  , and follow all the directions. Some key directions to look for include:  together or add bleach to other chemicals. \nMixing cleaning products can create toxic vapors. Before you use bleach or any other disinfectant or sanitizer, you need to thoroughly clean the surface with clean water and a detergent. Water and detergent, as well as the wiping action of a damp cloth or sponge, can effectively remove many microorganisms and debris from surfaces. If you use a disinfectant or sanitizer, such as bleach, you should only use it  you have thoroughly cleaned everything that was wet with flood water. Bleach and other disinfectants and sanitizers can kill microorganisms, but they don’t work well unless the dirt around the microorganisms is cleaned up first.   such as ammonia or chemicals brought in by contaminated flood water, because the combination can be toxic. If you aren’t sure what chemicals are in the flood water, clean as much as you can with water and detergent before using other products.  It is important to prevent unnecessary exposure to both microorganisms (such as viruses, bacteria, and mold) and cleaning products during flood cleanup.  Flood water can bring microorganisms, including from sewage and other sources, inside buildings. It can also allow microorganisms that were already inside to grow. During flood cleanup, exposure to these microorganisms can cause allergic or irritant effects, or in some cases even infectious diseases. Cleaning products may also trigger asthma symptoms or have irritant effects if they are not used or stored properly. Many unintentional exposures to bleaches and disinfectants are reported to poison control centers every year. If you have concerns about how flood cleanup work may affect your health, talk to your health care provider before you begin. Learn more about  . Find short how-to videos and other resources on  . If it is safe to do so, leave outside doors and windows open to keep air moving through the house as you clean and dry it out. Open inside doors and cabinets, and remove drawers, shelves, and built-in furniture (such as cabinets) to allow hidden surfaces to dry. If you have power, you can set up fans, dehumidifiers, or heaters throughout the house to speed up the drying process. However, it's a good idea to wait to start up fans or dehumidifiers until after you’ve gently cleaned all the mold you can see at least once. If the air outside is very humid and warm, it can slow down the drying process. If you have power, consider closing outside doors and windows and use fans, dehumidifiers, air conditioners and/or heaters to dry out the house. If any part of your HVAC system was affected by the flood,  use it to help dry out your house. Cleaning and drying your HVAC system can be complicated, so it is best to have a professional do it. If the air ducts in your HVAC system have become contaminated, the EPA document   provides information about choosing an air duct cleaning service provider.  If your HVAC system is working and is not contaminated, it may help with the drying process. However, you will likely need to use fans, dehumidifiers, and/or heaters, too. Most HVAC systems cannot dry out a home by themselves when the humidity is very high after a flood. Drying can take a long time, usually several days to weeks. Even after things look dry, you should keep the air moving with open doors and windows and any equipment you have available. Do not seal any areas, such as wall cavities, that were flooded and do not apply paint or sealants to any surfaces that were wet until you are sure the materials are completely dry on the inside. A moisture meter can help you determine whether materials such as walls, cabinets, and flooring are dry and ready for refinishing. You can usually find a moisture meter at a hardware store. Use the moisture meter to measure the moisture content of materials. Materials should read 15% or less to be ready for refinishing. To prevent mold growth, you should be sure your foundation is dry before you replace the flooring. An easy way to check if your concrete slab is dry enough to replace the flooring is: Watch the video   to see how to do this test.

After a   generates electricity, the electricity must be delivered to the end-user. This delivery happens in three steps: Utilities and other grid operators work together to generate and deliver electricity where and when it is needed. For the most part, electricity needs to be generated when it will be used. These needs fluctuate depending on the day, the time, and the weather. The graph below shows variations in the amount of electricity that customers used per hour over a typical week in the summer and a typical week in the winter. \n \nGeneration capacity availability can also fluctuate. For example, the amount of sunlight that can be captured by solar photovoltaic panels and converted to electricity depends on the weather (sunny or cloudy) and the angle of incoming sunlight (which depends on the season and time of day). Utilities and grid operators need to ensure that enough power will be generated to meet demand when it is high. Baseload power plants generate electricity in most hours of the year and often cannot be turned off or restarted easily. If consumers demand more electricity than baseload power plants can provide, operators respond by increasing production from centralized generation facilities that are already operating at a lower level or on standby, importing electricity from distant sources, or calling on end-users who agreed to consume less electricity from the grid through demand response programs. Improving the ability to balance electricity demand and supply is one reason investments are being made in   and  . In the second half of the 20th century, utilities began to interconnect their transmission systems to distribute electricity over longer distances from larger, more centralized power plants. This system has grown to include thousands of miles of transmission lines and millions of miles of distribution lines. While a single utility might build and maintain transmission and distribution lines, these lines are often shared by several utilities and electricity retailers. In some areas, regional organizations known as independent system operators (ISOs) or regional transmission organizations (RTOs), made up of utilities and federal and state regulators, coordinate transmission and distribution across their region. In areas without an established ISO or RTO, delivery systems are operated by individual utilities. To learn more about ISOs and RTOs,  . While the most significant environmental impacts of electricity relate to how it is generated, electricity delivery can also affect the environment in several ways: Many high-voltage circuit breakers, switches, and other pieces of equipment used in the transmission and distribution system are insulated with sulfur hexafluoride, which is a potent greenhouse gas. This gas can leak into the atmosphere from aging equipment or during maintenance and servicing. "},

The transportation sector accounts for a small fraction of electricity use, though this fraction could increase as electric vehicles become more widespread. All types of end-users can reduce electricity use through  . The residential sector includes single-family homes and multi-family housing, and it accounts for more than a third of the electricity used nationwide. As the graph shows, on average, the biggest single uses of electricity in the residential sector are space heating and cooling (air conditioning), lighting, water heating, space heating, and appliances and electronics. Electricity demand in the residential sector tends to be highest on hot summer afternoons due to increased air conditioning use, followed by evenings, when lights are turned on. The commercial sector includes government facilities, service-providing facilities and equipment, and other public and private organizations. This sector accounts for more than a third of U.S. electricity consumption. As the graph shows, on average, the biggest single uses of electricity in the commercial sector are lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Electricity demand in the commercial sector tends to be highest during operating business hours; it decreases substantially on nights and weekends. Industrial customers’ facilities and equipment use electricity for processing, producing, or assembling goods, including such diverse industries as manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and construction. Overall, this sector uses less than a third of the nation’s electricity. Data on specific end-uses are available from a broad nationwide survey of manufacturing facilities, which found that more than half of the electricity used in manufacturing goes to powering various motors (machine drive). Other sizable uses include heating, cooling, and electro-chemical processes in which electricity is used to cause a chemical transformation (for example, the processes that produce aluminum metal and chlorine). Electricity use in the industrial sector tends not to fluctuate through the day or year as in the residential and commercial sectors, particularly at manufacturing facilities that operate around-the-clock. The transportation sector consumes most of its energy by directly burning fossil fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. However, some vehicles use electricity from the electric power grid instead. These vehicles include battery-powered electric cars and plug-in hybrid electric cars that store power from the grid when they charge their batteries; various types of electric vans, trucks, and buses that do the same; and subway, electric rail, and trolley systems that are continuously connected to the electric power grid. Transportation activities account for less than 1 percent of total U.S. electricity use, but this percentage could grow as electric vehicles become more common. These vehicles can potentially even feed power back into the grid when demand from other sectors is high, which means the vehicles’ batteries are providing storage capacity for the grid."},

EPA ensures the scientific integrity of the climate change indicators through a rigorous development process, as described below. For every indicator, EPA also develops technical documentation that describes the data sources and analytical methods used. Access the technical documentation on  . On this page: Identification of candidate indicators is a function of the criteria used to evaluate them as well as the need to transparently document the underlying data and methods. EPA screens and selects each indicator using a standard set of criteria that consider data availability and quality, transparency of the analytical methods, and the indicator’s relevance to climate change. This process ensures that all indicators selected are consistently evaluated, are based on credible data, and can be transparently documented. EPA considers candidate indicators through coordinated outreach, stakeholder engagement, and reviewing the latest scientific literature. Key considerations for new indicators include: 1) filling gaps in the existing indicator set in an attempt to be more comprehensive; 2) newly available, or in some cases improved, data sources that have been peer-reviewed and are publicly available from government agencies, academic institutions, and other organizations; 3) analytical development of indicators resulting from existing partnerships and collaborative efforts within and external to EPA (e.g., development of streamflow metrics in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey for the benefit of the partner agencies as well as key programs within EPA’s Office of Water); and 4) indicators that communicate key aspects of climate change and that are understandable to various audiences, including the general public.  EPA chooses indicators that meet a set of 10 criteria that consider data quality, transparency of analytical methods, and relevance to climate change. Based on the availability of these data, some indicators present a single measure or variable while others have multiple measures, reflecting different data sources or different ways to group, characterize, or zoom in on the data. The criteria EPA uses to select indicators are: EPA researches, screens, and selects indicators based on an objective, transparent process that considers the scientific integrity of each candidate indicator, the availability of data, and the value of including the candidate indicator. EPA conducts the screening process in two stages. As an initial screen, each candidate indicator is evaluated against five of   to assess whether or not it is reasonable to further evaluate and screen the indicator. These “Tier 1” criteria include peer-review status of the data, feasibility to construct, usefulness, understandability to the public, and connection to climate change. Indicators that reasonably meet these criteria are researched further; indicators that do not meet these criteria are eliminated from consideration. Some of the candidate indicators ruled out at this stage include ideas that could be viable indicators in the future (e.g., indicators that do not yet have published data or need further investigation into methods). Indicators deemed appropriate for additional screening are assessed against the Tier 2 criteria: transparency, reproducibility, and objectivity, broad geographic range, actual observations, trends over time, and uncertainty. Based on the findings from the complete set of 10 criteria, the indicators are again evaluated based on the assessment of the remaining criteria. The distinction between Tier 1 and Tier 2 criteria is not intended to suggest that one group is necessarily more important than the other. Rather, EPA determined that a reasonable approach was to consider which criteria must be met before proceeding further and to narrow the list of indicator candidates before the remaining criteria were applied Based on the results of the screening process, the most promising indicators are developed into proposed indicator summaries. EPA consults the published literature, subject matter experts, and online databases to obtain data for each of these indicators. Upon acquiring sound data and technical documentation, EPA prepares a set of possible graphics for each indicator, along with a summary table that describes the proposed metric(s), data sources, limitations, and other relevant information. Summary information is reviewed by EPA technical staff, and then the indicator concepts that meet the screening criteria are formally approved to begin development. Graphics, summary text, and technical documentation for all proposed new or revised indicators are developed in accordance with the format established for the original 24 indicators in the 2010 indicator report. An additional priority for development is to make sure that each indicator communicates effectively to a non-technical audience without misrepresenting the underlying data and source(s) of information. Regional features (e.g., Community Connections) are developed in the same manner. The complete indicator packages (graphics, summary text, and technical documentation) undergo EPA internal review, data provider/collaborator review, and an independent peer review. Indicators are reviewed at various stages of development by EPA technical staff and various levels of management within the Agency. Organizations and individuals who collected and/or compiled the data (e.g., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey) review the relevant indicators. EPA also enlists technical experts to assist in review of new indicators or revisions. Each new indicator also undergoes independent peer review by subject-matter experts external to EPA. EPA’s indicator compilation reports (i.e., the 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 print editions) have also gone through independent external peer review. EPA follows the procedures in EPA’s   (the most recent edition is the fourth, EPA/100/B-15/001) for reports that do not provide influential scientific information. The reviews are managed by a contractor under the direction of a designated EPA peer review leader, who prepares a peer-review plan, the scope of work for the review contract, and the charge for the reviewers. The peer review leader plays no role in producing the indicators or reports. EPA’s peer-review process also includes a quality-control check by the peer review leader to ensure that the authors took sufficient action and provided an adequate response for every peer review and re-review comment. Existing indicators are re-evaluated to ensure they are relevant, comprehensive, and sustainable. The process of re-evaluating indicators includes monitoring the availability of newer data, eliciting expert review, and assessing indicators in light of new science. EPA improves existing indicators by adding or replacing metrics or underlying data sources. These revisions involve obtaining new data sets and vetting their scientific validity. For example, a new independent data set and analysis has been made available related to trends in ocean heat content. As a result, EPA updated the   indicator to include this new data series, making the indicator more comprehensive.  EPA compiles technical documentation for every indicator to ensure that it is fully transparent — so readers can learn where the data come from, how each indicator was calculated, and how accurately each indicator represents the intended environmental condition. EPA uses a standard technical documentation format that includes 13 elements for each indicator: Readers can access technical documentation for any indicator through a link on  ."},

Please  . “Centralized generation” refers to the large-scale generation of electricity at centralized facilities. These facilities are usually located away from end-users and connected to a network of high-voltage transmission lines. The electricity generated by centralized generation is distributed through the electric power grid to multiple end-users. Centralized generation facilities include fossil-fuel-fired power plants, nuclear power plants, hydroelectric dams, wind farms, and more. The vast majority of the electricity that Americans use is from centralized generation. Centralized generation facilities in the United States currently have the capacity to generate more than 1,100 gigawatts of electric power. The earliest electric utilities operated independently from each other. A consumer would purchase electricity from a utility in their area, which would then provide the electricity through its own electricity delivery system. During the second half of the 20th century, utilities found it more efficient and economical to connect their delivery systems, resulting in the need to coordinate power plant operations. The majority of electricity generation in the United States today is coordinated by regional system operators to ensure reliability. Therefore, the electricity delivered to consumers by their local electric utility may be generated at a centralized power plant located in another city or state and owned by a different company. These power plants are subject to economic, reliability, and environmental regulations by federal, tribal, state, and/or local governments. The environmental impacts of electricity generation can contribute to large-scale regional environmental concerns as well as localized concerns that affect the area directly surrounding a power plant. Some impacts vary based on the energy resource—for example, whether the power plant uses fossil fuel or a renewable resource. In addition to the impacts from power generation, there are also impacts associated with extracting, producing, and transporting certain fuels such as coal and natural gas.  In general, centralized power plants can affect the environment in the following ways: In addition to these environmental impacts, much of the primary energy (total energy content) of fossil fuels burned at power plants is wasted during generation and delivery to end-users. Opportunities exist to improve the energy efficiency of power plants, as well as to locate electricity generation closer to end-users to reduce losses during  ."},

This feature tracks the annual peak bloom date of Washington, D.C.’s famous cherry trees. This figure shows the timing of peak bloom each year for the main type of cherry tree around the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C. The peak bloom date occurs when 70 percent of the blossoms are in full bloom. The shaded band shows the timing of the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival. The festival began in 1934 but was not held during World War II. Data sources: National Cherry Blossom Festival, 2024;  National Park Service, 2024 \n In Washington, D.C., the arrival of spring brings a splash of color as the city’s iconic cherry trees burst into bloom. The city has enjoyed cherry blossoms each year dating back to 1912, when Japan gave about 3,000 cherry trees to the United States as a gift of friendship. These trees surround Washington’s Tidal Basin, and the beautiful blooms set against the backdrop of the national monuments bring more than 1.5 million visitors to the area every year during the National Cherry Blossom Festival. Not surprisingly, the festival is planned to coincide with the peak bloom of the cherry trees. The exact timing of peak bloom varies from year to year, and it is largely driven by local temperatures during the winter and early spring. Many plants are sensitive to and respond to environmental cues such as when temperature reaches a certain threshold. As the   indicator explains, scientists have very high confidence that recent warming trends in global climate are causing spring events such as leaf growth and flower blooms to happen earlier.  In the case of Washington’s cherry blossoms, earlier bloom dates could affect tourism and the local economy. The peak bloom date for the most common type of cherry tree around Washington’s Tidal Basin—the Yoshino variety—has been carefully estimated and recorded since 1921 by the National Park Service. The peak bloom date is defined as the day when 70 percent of the blossoms are in full bloom. Figure 1 shows how the peak bloom date of the Yoshino cherry trees has changed since 1921. It also shows the dates of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, which has grown to several weeks as its popularity has expanded. There is considerable variability in the peak bloom date, which makes predicting the exact timing difficult. Anticipation of the peak bloom captivates meteorologists, city planners, the National Park Service, residents, and tourists each year. For this and other examples of community connections to observed climate-related changes, see the StoryMap at:  . In addition to winter and early spring temperatures, the timing of the peak bloom for cherry trees can be affected by other weather, climate, and location factors. For example, extended growing periods and warmer autumns could affect bloom dates by altering other stages of cherry tree growth. Peak bloom dates and festival dates were provided by the National Park Service and organizers of the National Cherry Blossom Festival.

Schwartz to data from Schwartz et al., 2013 \n This figure shows modeled trends in lilac and honeysuckle first bloom dates at weather stations across the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. This map compares the average first bloom date for two 10-year periods. Data source: 2024 update by M. Schwartz to data from Schwartz et al., 2013 \n The timing of natural events, such as flower blooms and animal migration, is influenced by a combination of environmental factors, including temperature, light, rainfall, and humidity. Phenology is the study of such important seasonal events. Phenological events are influenced by a combination of environmental factors, including temperature, light, rainfall, and humidity. Different plant and animal species respond to different cues. Scientists have very high confidence that the earlier arrival of spring events is linked to recent warming trends in global climate.  Disruptions in the timing of these events can have a variety of impacts on ecosystems and human society. For example, an earlier spring might lead to longer growing seasons (see the   indicator), more abundant invasive species and pests, and earlier and longer allergy seasons (see the   indicator). Unusually warm weather in late winter can create a “false spring” that triggers the new growth of plants to begin too early, leaving them vulnerable to any subsequent frosts. Because of their close connection with climate, the timing of phenological events can be used as an indicator of the sensitivity of ecological processes to climate change. Two particularly useful indicators of the timing of spring events are the first leaf dates and the first bloom dates of lilacs and honeysuckles, which have an easily monitored flowering season, a relatively high survival rate, and a large geographic distribution. The first leaf date in these plants relates to the timing of events that occur in early spring, while the first bloom date is consistent with the timing of later spring events, such as the start of growth in forest vegetation. This indicator shows trends in the timing of first leaf dates and first bloom dates in lilacs and honeysuckles across the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. Because many of the phenological observation records in the United States are less than 40 years long, and because these records may have gaps in time or space, computer models have been used to provide a more complete understanding of long-term trends nationwide. The models for this indicator were developed using data from the USA National Phenology Network, which collects ground observations from a network of federal agencies, field stations, educational institutions, and citizens who have been trained to log observations of leaf and bloom dates. For consistency, observations were limited to a few specific types of lilacs and honeysuckles. Next, models were created to relate actual leaf and bloom observations with records from nearby weather stations. Once scientists were able to determine the relationship between climate factors (particularly temperatures) and leaf and bloom dates, they used this knowledge to estimate leaf and bloom dates for earlier years based on historical weather records. They also used the models to estimate how leaf and bloom dates would have changed in a few areas (mostly the warmest parts of the South and West and the coldest parts of Alaska) where lilacs and honeysuckles are not widespread. This indicator uses data from nearly 3,000 weather stations throughout the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. The exact number of stations varies from year to year. For each year, the timing of first leaf and first bloom at each station was compared with the 1981 to 2010 average to determine the number of days’ “deviation from normal.” This indicator presents the average deviation across all stations, along with maps that compare the most recent 10-year period (2014–2023) with a mid-20 -century baseline (1951–1960) at individual stations. These time periods were chosen to match published studies. Plant phenological events are studied using several data collection methods, including satellite images, models, and direct observations. The use of different data collection methods and different phenological indicators (such as leaf or bloom dates for different types of plants) can lead to a range of estimates of the arrival of spring. Climate is not the only factor that can affect phenology. Observed variations can also reflect plant genetics, changes in the surrounding ecosystem, and other factors. This indicator minimizes the influence of genetic variations by relying on cloned plants, which have no genetic differences. Leaf and bloom observations were compiled by the USA National Phenology Network and are available at:  . This indicator is also based on temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, which maintains a large collection of climate data online at:  . Data for this indicator were analyzed using methods described by Schwartz et al. (2013)."},

This indicator examines changes in the location of fish, shellfish, and other marine species along U.S. coasts. These graphs show the annual change in latitude (movement in miles) and depth (feet) of 41 marine species along the Northeast coast, 58 in the eastern Bering Sea, and 58 along the Southeast coast. The multi-region average consists of 157 unique species. Changes in the centers of biomass have been aggregated across all species and by region. For each region, the change in latitude and change in depth are set at zero for a base year, 1989.

Dots are shaded from light to dark to show change over time. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n Changes in water temperature can affect the environments where fish, shellfish, and other marine species live. Certain fish species naturally migrate in response to seasonal temperature changes, moving northward or to deeper, cooler waters in the summer and migrating back during the winter. As climate change causes the oceans to become warmer year-round (see the   and   indicators), however, populations of some species may adapt by shifting away from areas that have become too warm and toward areas that were previously cooler. Along U.S. coasts, this means a shift northward or to deeper waters that may have a more suitable temperature. As smaller prey species shift their habitats, larger predator species may follow them. Marine species represent a particularly good indicator of warming oceans because they are sensitive to climate and because they have been studied and tracked for many years. Fish are especially mobile, and they may shift their location more easily than species on land because they face fewer physical barriers.  Also, many marine species, especially fish, do not have fixed nesting places or dwellings that might otherwise compel them to stay in one place. Populations of many marine species have been measured consistently for several decades across various types of ocean habitats. Tracking data from many species is useful because if a change in behavior or distribution occurs across a large range of species, it is more likely the result of a more systematic or common cause. The movement of species based on their preferred temperature conditions can affect commercial and recreational fisheries, with implications for fisheries management and the economy of communities that rely on fisheries.  Climate-related fishery losses have already resulted in billions of dollars of lost catch in recent years, directly harming jobs, livelihoods, and local culture.  Temperature-driven changes in suitable habitats are expected to continue in the future. This indicator tracks marine animal species in terms of their “center of biomass,” which is a point on the map that represents the center of each species’ distribution by weight. If a fish population were to shift generally northward, the center of biomass would shift northward as well. This approach is similar to the way changes in bird population distributions have been measured (see the   indicator). Data for this indicator were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service and other agencies. These agencies monitor marine species populations by conducting annual surveys in which they trawl the ocean at regular intervals along the coast. By recording what they catch at each location, scientists can calculate each species’ center of biomass in terms of latitude, longitude, and depth. This indicator focuses on three survey regions that have the most continuous and longest-running sampling: the Northeast, the eastern Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska, and the Southeast. Figure 1 shows the average change in the center of biomass across 157 species in these regions as well as changes by region. For consistency, each line in Figure 1 is limited to species with the most complete records throughout the timeframe shown. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show detailed changes for three species in each region. These species were chosen because they represent a variety of habitats and species types (a mixture of fish and shellfish) and because they tend to be fairly abundant. Some of these species support major fisheries, but are presumed not to be heavily affected by overfishing, reducing the chance that fishing is unduly influencing the observed trends. Northeast data come from surveys that have been conducted every spring since 1974, Bering Sea data come from summer surveys that have been conducted consistently since 1985, and Southeast data come from surveys that have been conducted every spring since 1989. Water temperature is not the only factor that can cause marine animal populations to shift. Other factors could include interactions with other species, harvesting, ocean circulation patterns, habitat change, and species’ ability to disperse and adapt. As a result, species might have moved northward for reasons other than, or in addition to, changing sea temperatures. This indicator is limited to the Northeast, the eastern Bering Sea, and the Southeast because these areas have used consistent survey methods and because they do not have coastlines that would prevent species from moving northward in response to warming (in contrast to regions like the Gulf of Mexico, where the coast blocks northward migration). Data for this indicator were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service during annual bottom trawl fisheries surveys. These data have been processed and made publicly available through the Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal at:  . Data from these surveys have been used to support a wide variety of studies."},

This feature explores changes in bird populations on an island along Alaska’s Arctic northern coast.  This figure shows the number of breeding pairs in the black guillemot colony that inhabits Cooper Island along the north coast of Alaska, measured at the peak of breeding season (green line). The dashed orange line indicates the number of installed nest site structures available to black guillemots on Cooper Island each year. \nData source: Divoky, 2024 \n A colony of black guillemots have made Cooper Island near Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, home for at least 50 years. The area’s unique landscape and sea ice are integral components of this bird’s habitat. The black guillemot spends the winter on Arctic sea ice, and it breeds on land near the edge of the ice in summer.  One of the primary food sources for the birds’ chicks is the Arctic cod, which thrives in cold, ice-covered waters. Warming temperatures and other changes are reducing the extent and persistence of Arctic sea ice (see the   indicator), which has been linked to a decline in the abundance of Arctic cod over the last few decades. The region has experienced an increase in the number of days without snow cover each year.  This longer period has helped the black guillemots during breeding season, when they prefer a snow-free nest cavity.  However, as the Arctic has warmed, sea ice has decreased significantly—melting earlier and freezing later.  This change, for certain parts of the year, has led to more open water and increased the distance from the coast to the edge of the ice, where these birds forage for Arctic cod.  This type of ecosystem change has broader implications not only for these two species, but also for other animals in the Arctic that depend on marine prey, such as polar bears, and for people who depend on Arctic animals for food and other resources. A group of scientists and volunteers have been observing and counting birds at the Cooper Island colony for almost 50 years. Birds are counted every summer and identified as breeding pairs if two are found to be inhabiting a specific nesting site on the island. This long-term record provides valuable clues about how rapid changes being observed in the Arctic may be influencing the natural environment. For this and other examples of community connections to observed climate-related changes, see the StoryMap at:  . Changes in the number of breeding pairs in the Cooper Island colony can be influenced by several factors other than the presence or absence of sea ice and resulting reduced prey availability. These other factors include competition from other bird species, the activity of predators such as polar bears, and the success of and immigration from other black guillemot colonies in the Arctic. The timing and duration of the breeding season can also change in response to changing temperatures and snow and ice conditions. In addition, as the count of breeding pairs depends on the observation of successful egg laying, changes in fertility or nest predation could influence annual totals. Consistent methods have been used to count the number of breeding pairs on Cooper Island annually for more than 40 years.  Guillemots began breeding at Cooper Island sometime after the U.S. Navy left wooden boxes on the island in the mid-1950s, which the birds used for nesting. The colony was officially discovered by researchers in 1972, when it consisted of 10 breeding pairs.  The researchers began building artificial nest sites, adding 190 sites before they stopped in the mid-1980s. Cooper Island had more breeding pairs than nest sites in the late 1980s, when some of the larger nesting sites were occupied by more than one pair. Additional birds were present but were unable to breed due to the limited number of nest cavities. The data in this feature are collected by researchers and provided by George Divoky and the Friends of Cooper Island ( ). This data set has been used and published as part of peer-reviewed journal articles on observed changes in northern Alaska—particularly the region near Utqiagvik."},

This indicator examines changes in the winter ranges of North American birds. This figure shows annual change in latitude of bird center of abundance for 305 widespread bird species in North America from 1966 to 2013. Each winter is represented by the year in which it began (for example, winter 2013–2014 is shown as 2013). The shaded band shows the likely range for the average, based on how all the individual species have moved over time. Data source: National Audubon Society, 2014 \n This figure shows annual change in distance to the coast of bird center of abundance for 272 widespread bird species in North America from 1966 to 2013. This figure covers 272 species instead of the 305 species shown in Figure 1 because 33 of the species in Figure 1 need access to salt water, which means they cannot move inland. Each winter is represented by the year in which it began (for example, winter 2013–2014 is shown as 2013). The shaded band shows the likely range for the average, based on how all the individual species have moved over time. Data source: National Audubon Society, 2014 \n Changes in climate can affect ecosystems by influencing animal behavior and ranges. Birds are a particularly good indicator of environmental change for several reasons: Temperature and precipitation patterns are changing across the United States (see the   indicator and the   indicator). Some bird species can adapt to generally warmer temperatures by changing where they live—for example, by migrating farther north in the summer but not as far south in the winter, or by shifting inland as winter temperature extremes grow less severe. Non-migratory species might shift as well, expanding into newly suitable habitats while moving out of areas that become less suitable. Other types of birds might not adapt to changing conditions and could experience a population decline as a result. Climate change can also alter the timing of events that are based on temperature cues, such as migration and breeding (especially egg-laying). This indicator looks collectively at the “center of abundance” of hundreds of widespread North American bird species over a 48-year period. The center of abundance is a point on the map that represents the middle of each species’ distribution. If a whole population of birds were to shift generally northward, one would see the center of abundance shift northward as well. For year-to-year consistency, this indicator uses observations from the National Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count, which takes place every year in early winter. The Christmas Bird Count is a long-running citizen-science program in which individuals are organized by the National Audubon Society, Bird Studies Canada, local Audubon chapters, and other bird clubs to identify and count bird species. The data presented in this indicator were collected from more than 2,000 locations throughout the United States and parts of Canada. At each location, skilled observers follow a standard counting procedure to estimate the number of birds within a 15-mile diameter “count circle” over a 24-hour period. Study methods remain generally consistent from year to year. Data produced by the Christmas Bird Count go through several levels of review before Audubon scientists analyze the final data, which have been used to support a wide variety of peer-reviewed studies. Many factors can influence bird ranges, including food availability, habitat alteration, and interactions with other species. As a result, some of the birds included in this indicator might have moved north for reasons other than changing temperatures. This indicator does not show how responses to climate change vary among different types of birds. For example, a more detailed National Audubon Society analysis found large differences among coastal birds, grassland birds, and birds adapted to feeders, which all have different abilities to adapt to temperature changes. Some data variations can be caused by differences among count circles, such as inconsistent level of effort by volunteer observers, but these differences are carefully corrected in Audubon’s statistical analysis. Bird center-of-abundance data were collected by the annual Christmas Bird Count organized by the National Audubon Society and Bird Studies Canada.

This indicator measures water levels and surface water temperatures in the Great Lakes. This figure displays how water levels in each of the Great Lakes have changed since 1860. For each year, the shaded band shows the range of monthly average water levels, and the line in the middle shows the annual average. The graph uses the 1981 to 2010 average as a baseline for depicting change. Choosing a different baseline period would not change the shape of the data over time. Lakes Michigan and Huron are shown together because they are connected at the same water level. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n This figure shows the average surface water temperatures in each of the Great Lakes, as measured by satellites. The graphs on the left show annual averages for the full time period, while the graphs on the right show how average daily temperatures have changed between two time periods for comparison: 2014–2023 versus 1995–2004. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n Water level and water temperature are two important and interrelated indicators of weather and climate change in the Great Lakes. Water level (the height of the lake surface above sea level) is influenced by many factors, including precipitation, snowmelt runoff, drought, evaporation rates, and people withdrawing water for multiple uses. Water temperature is influenced by many factors, too, but most directly by air temperature. In some recent years, high precipitation has contributed to higher-than-average and sometimes record-breaking water levels in the Great Lakes.  In other recent years, warmer surface water temperatures in the Great Lakes have contributed to lower water levels by increasing rates of evaporation and causing lake ice to form later than usual (see the   indicator), which extends the season for evaporation.  Lower water levels in the Great Lakes forced ships to reduce their cargo tonnage by 5 to 8 percent between 1997 and 2000, which increased shipping costs.  Lower water levels can also affect water supplies, the usability of infrastructure such as docks and piers, and shoreline ecosystems. Scientists who use computer models to simulate future climate change are not sure whether Great Lakes water levels will increase or decrease overall in the future, but they generally agree that there will be larger year-to-year variability, driven by periods of drought and extreme precipitation. Another possible effect of warmer water, reduced ice cover, and increased evaporation is a corresponding increase in precipitation over nearby land, especially “lake effect” snow (see the   indicator).  Rising water temperatures are also expected to expand the ranges of and give new advantages to some invasive species such as the zebra mussel, and to encourage the growth of certain waterborne bacteria that can make people ill. This indicator analyzes water levels and surface water temperatures in the Great Lakes. Water levels are recorded by gauges along the shore of each lake, some of which have been operated since the 1800s. Pre-1918 data came from one water level gauge per lake. Data since 1918 have come from a designated set of gauges in each lake. Figure 1 shows annual water level anomalies in each lake from 1860 to 2023; anomalies are differences, in feet, compared with a baseline (in this case, the 1981–2010 average). Lakes Michigan and Huron are combined because they are connected at the same water level. Surface water temperatures are measured by satellites. Figure 2 shows annual average temperatures over the entire surface of each lake, along with the pattern of daily temperatures over the course of the year. This figure’s data begin in 1995, which was the first year with complete satellite data for all five lakes. While climate change influences water levels, human activities such as dredging can also play a role. For example, the St. Clair River opening was enlarged in the 1910s, 1930s, and 1960s, contributing to greater outflows from Lakes Michigan and Huron.  Similarly, natural year-to-year variability and other factors such as human use and wastewater discharges can influence water temperatures.

This indicator shows changes in surface water temperatures in North American lakes. This map shows the total change in the average July–September surface water temperatures in 34 North American lakes from 1985 to 2009, as measured by satellites. Red circles represent warming; blue circles represent cooling. Larger circles indicate larger changes. Circles with black borders represent lakes where the trend was statistically significant. Data source: Sharma et al., 2015 \n Water temperature is an important physical property of every lake. Many plants, animals, and other organisms flourish only in a specific range of water temperatures. Temperature can also affect certain aspects of water quality. For example, higher temperatures promote the growth of algae and bacteria, but they also reduce levels of dissolved oxygen in the water, which can negatively affect the growth and productivity of other aquatic life. Water temperature also influences the circulation or mixing patterns within a lake, which affects nutrient levels. \n \nTemperature influences how people are able to use lakes. For example, while warmer water might be more inviting for recreation, it also contributes to blooms of harmful algae and bacteria that produce toxins. These toxins can cause illnesses in recreational users and contaminate drinking water supplies. Warmer water lengthens the season when lakes are ice-free (see the   indicator). This can benefit boaters and shippers but also increases evaporation, lowering water levels (see the   indicator). Less lake ice reduces opportunities for winter recreation, such as ice fishing and hockey.  Water temperature is influenced by many factors, but most directly by air temperature. As rising air temperatures (see the   indicator) cause lake temperatures to rise, the geographic ranges and growth seasons of certain harmful algae and bacteria are expected to expand.  Rising water temperatures are also expected to expand the ranges of and give new advantages to certain invasive species, such as the zebra mussel. This indicator looks at the average summer water temperatures of 34 lakes in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, based on satellite measurements that detect the temperature of the water at the surface (approximately 1 meter or 3 feet in depth). Because water temperature can also be influenced by wastewater discharges and other human activities, this indicator focuses on a select set of lakes that are relatively large, natural bodies of water (all more than 150 square miles) where consistent data dating back to 1985 were available. Furthermore, each lake’s measurements were taken in a single location near the center of the lake to minimize influences such as shoreline development and other land use activities. Figure 1 shows long-term rates of change in surface lake water temperature from 1985 to 2009. Natural year-to-year variability in air temperatures and other factors can influence water temperatures. This indicator accounts for these types of variations by focusing on long-term trends over 25 years of data. Water temperatures can also vary at different locations within a lake. Measurements taken at one location may be representative of the lake as a whole, but it is also possible that other parts of the lake have warmed or cooled at different rates. This indicator uses nighttime measurements to avoid being overly influenced by short-term heating during the day. This indicator is limited to summer temperatures because these measurements are not likely to be distorted by ice cover. Summer measurements are particularly useful because this time of year is when many aquatic organisms are most active. For example, summer is the peak season for the growth of algae, and summer maximum temperatures determine whether lakes and ponds can support certain types of coldwater fish, such as trout. Summer lake temperatures are important as they influence how the water separates into warm and cold layers, which affects mixing and the availability of oxygen and nutrients. Satellite data were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European Space Agency and processed by a group of researchers from multiple organizations called the Global Lake Temperature Collaboration. Processed data for each lake are available from the Long Term Ecological Research Network Data Portal at:  ."},

Data source: USGS, 2023 \n Climate change has challenged and will continue to challenge some of the traditional ways of life that have sustained indigenous peoples for thousands of years. In the Pacific Northwest, warming river and stream temperatures will threaten ecosystems and species, including salmon populations.  Salmon play a particularly important role in the diet, culture, religion, and economy of Native Americans in this region. Salmon are sensitive to water temperature at many stages of their lives. They spend much of their adult lives in the ocean, then migrate inland to spawn. Salmon need cold water to migrate and for their young to hatch and grow successfully. Warmer water can negatively affect fish, making it more difficult for them to swim upstream. It can also make fish more susceptible to disease.  River and stream temperatures in the Pacific Northwest are influenced by many factors, but are expected to rise as average air temperatures increase (see the   indicator). The graph shows average August water temperatures at a site in the Snake River, in eastern Washington near Nez Perce tribal lands. Several species of salmon use the Snake River to migrate and spawn.

Red circles show locations where temperatures have increased; blue circles show locations where temperatures have decreased. Filled circles represent sites where the change was statistically significant. Data source: Jastram and Rice, 2015 \n Water temperature is an important physical property of every river and stream. Many plants, animals, and other organisms living in streams can flourish only in a specific range of water temperatures. Temperature can affect certain aspects of water quality. For example, higher temperatures reduce levels of dissolved oxygen in the water, which can negatively affect the growth and productivity of aquatic life. Persistently warmer temperatures in streams can accelerate natural chemical reactions and release excess nutrients into the water.  A stream’s water temperature can also influence the circulation or mixing patterns in the water it flows into, like bays and estuaries, potentially affecting nutrient levels and salinity. \n \nTemperatures can vary naturally along the length of a stream, from cold temperatures near a source of meltwater to higher temperatures near its outlet to the sea. The temperature at any given point is a product of many different factors, including sources of water (for example, melted snow, a recent rainstorm, or groundwater), the amount of water in the stream (streamflow), air temperature, plants along the bank (for example, trees that provide shade), and the amount of development within the watershed. Over time, however, an area’s climate has the strongest natural influence on a stream’s temperature.  The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, an important habitat for countless aquatic species, and a driver of the regional economy. As rising air temperatures (see the   indicator) cause stream temperatures to rise, warmer stream water coming into the bay can stress plants and animals and worsen the effects of nutrient pollution that the bay is already facing. The U.S. Geological Survey maintains thousands of stream gauges across the United States. Each gauge measures water levels several times a day, typically every 15 minutes. Field technicians visit each gauging station an average of eight times a year to measure various stream conditions, including water temperature. This indicator shows how average water temperatures throughout the year changed between 1960 and 2014 at 129 stream gauges located across the Chesapeake Bay region. These stations were selected because they had high-quality data for this entire time period. In addition to climate, changes to a stream’s average water temperature can be influenced by other factors such as industrial discharges, changes to local hydrology (such as construction and operation of dams and channels), and changes to land cover in the watershed. This indicator uses measurements from all stream gauges with sufficient data. Thus, it includes some stream sites that are likely more disturbed by human activities than others. A more detailed analysis of this data set found that water temperature tends to increase more quickly than air temperature in agricultural areas without major dams, but more slowly at forested sites and in areas influenced by dams.  Nonetheless, a comparison of 35 relatively undisturbed reference stations with the remaining 94 stations in this indicator showed no significant difference in trends between the two groups of stations. This indicator is based on measurements that are collected an average of eight times per year, but more in some years and less in others. The data were analyzed in a way that accounts for variations in timing and makes it possible to compare average temperatures across many years. This indicator is based on an analysis developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  Periodic temperature data were collected by the USGS, and these data are stored in the USGS National Water Information System."},

Data source: USGS, 2023 \n This map shows changes in the timing of annual high winter-spring flow carried by rivers and streams from 1940 to 2022. This analysis focuses on parts of the country where streamflow is strongly influenced by snowmelt. Trends are based on the winter-spring center of volume, which is the date when half of the total January 1–July 31 streamflow (in the West) or half of the total January 1–May 31 streamflow (in the East) has passed by each streamflow gauge, reflecting the timing of spring snowmelt. Data source: USGS, 2023 \n This map shows changes in the number of days with very low streamflow for rivers and streams across the country, from 1940 to 2022. This map is based on the number of daily flow values below the 2-percentile flow (Q2) threshold. Positive trends (upward brown triangles) indicate an increase in the number of days per year at or below the Q2 threshold (drier conditions); negative trends (downward blue triangles) indicate a trend toward fewer very low flow days (wetter conditions). Data source: USGS, 2023 \n Streamflow is a measure of the rate at which water is carried by rivers and streams, and it represents a critical resource for people and the environment. Changes in streamflow can directly influence the supply of drinking water and the amount of water available for irrigating crops, generating electricity, and other needs. In addition, many plants and animals depend on streamflow for habitat and survival. Streamflow naturally varies over the course of a year. For example, rivers and streams in many parts of the country have their highest flow when snow melts in the spring and their lowest flow in late summer. The amount of streamflow is important because very high flows can cause erosion and damaging floods, while very low flows can diminish water quality, harm fish, reduce the amount of water available for people to use, and disrupt economic activities like river shipping. The timing of high flow is important because it affects the ability of reservoir managers to store water to meet needs later in the year. In addition, some plants and animals (such as fish that migrate) depend on a particular pattern of streamflow as part of their life cycles. Climate change can affect streamflow in several ways. Changes in the amount of spring snowpack (see the  indicator) and air temperatures that influence melting can alter the size and timing of high spring streamflows. More precipitation is expected to cause higher average streamflow in some places, while heavier storms (see the   indicator) could lead to larger peak flows. More frequent or severe droughts, however, could reduce streamflow in certain areas. The U.S. Geological Survey measures streamflow in rivers and streams across the United States using continuous monitoring devices called stream gauges. This indicator is based on data from 189 stream gauges located in areas where trends are not substantially influenced by dams, reservoir management, wastewater treatment facilities, or land-use change. The indicator also excludes stream gauges with watershed areas that overlap substantially. This indicator examines five important measures of streamflow conditions that occur during the course of a year. Figure 1 shows trends in the lowest flows each year, which are commonly calculated by averaging the lowest seven consecutive days of streamflow. Figure 2 shows trends in high flow conditions, which are commonly calculated by averaging the highest three consecutive days of streamflow in a year. Three days is an optimal length of time to characterize runoff associated with large storms and peak snowmelt. Figure 3 shows changes in the annual average streamflow, which is calculated by averaging daily flows through the entire year. Figure 4 shows trends in the timing of winter and spring runoff. This measure is limited to 56 stream gauges in areas where at least 30 percent of annual precipitation falls as snow. Scientists look at the total volume of water that passes by a gauge between January 1 and July 31 for the western United States, and January 1 and May 31 for the eastern United States, then determine the date when exactly half of that water has gone by. This date is called the winter-spring center-of-volume date. A long-term trend toward an earlier date could be caused by earlier spring snowmelt, more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow, or other changes in precipitation patterns. Figure 5 shows trends in the number of days each year with very low flow, which indicates whether streams are becoming drier or wetter during the period. The figure shows the annual number of days that daily average streamflow is equal to or lower than the long-term 2-percentile flow (Q2) threshold. In general, daily average flows are equal to or lower than the Q2 threshold about seven days of the year. Streamflow measurements were used from gauges in areas where streamflow is minimally affected by human influences such as dams, land development, or changes in land cover. Changes in land cover and land use over time, however, could still influence streamflow trends at some streams. The gauges used for this indicator are not evenly distributed across the country, due to variation in the availability of long-term data. Streamflow data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. These data came from a set of gauges in watersheds with minimal human impacts, which have been classified as reference gauges.  Daily average streamflow data are stored in the National Water Information System and are publicly available at:  ."},

Data source: NIFC, 2024;  Short, 2015 \n This figure shows the distribution of acreage burned by large wildfires, based on the level of damage caused to the landscape—a measure of wildfire severity. Large wildfires are defined as fires with an area larger than 1,000 acres in the western United States and 500 acres in the eastern United States. The total acreage shown in Figure 3 is slightly less than the total in Figure 2 because Figure 3 is limited to large fires and because a few areas did not have sufficient satellite imagery to allow damage to be assessed. Data source: MTBS, 2024 \n This map shows the average number of acres burned in each state per year as a proportion of that state’s total land area. Darker-shaded states have the largest proportion of acreage burned. For reference, there are 640 acres in a square mile; therefore, an average burned area of 6.4 acres per square mile would mean that fires burned 1 percent of a state’s total land area. States that did not have any fires that were large enough to be included in this analysis are shaded gray. Click on a state to reveal the trend in a line graph. Data source: MTBS, 2024 \n This map shows how the number of acres burned in each state as a proportion of that state’s total land area has changed over time, based on a simple comparison between the first half of the available years (1984–2002) and the second half (2003–2021). For reference, there are 640 acres in a square mile; therefore, a change of 6.4 acres per square mile would mean that burned area increased by 1 percent of a state’s total land area.

Data source: MTBS, 2024 \n This figure compares the annual distribution of burned area due to wildfires in the United States between the first half of the period of measurement (1984–2002) and the second half (2003–2021). Data source: MTBS, 2023 \n  This figure compares the annual distribution of burned area due to wildfires in the eastern and western United States between the first half of the period of measurement (1984–2002) and the second half (2003–2021). Data source: MTBS, 2023 \n Together, forests, shrubland, and grassland cover more than half of the land area in the United States.  These ecosystems are important resources, both environmentally and economically. Although wildfires occur naturally and play a long-term role in the health of these ecosystems, changing wildfire patterns threaten to upset the status quo. Multiple studies have found that climate change has already led to an increase in wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and burned area.  The wildfire season has lengthened in many areas due to factors including warmer springs, longer summer dry seasons, and drier soils and vegetation.  Similarly, climate change threatens to increase the frequency, extent, and severity of fires through increased temperatures and drought (see the   and   indicators).  Earlier spring melting and reduced snowpack (see the   indicator) result in decreased water availability during hot summer conditions, which in turn contributes to an increased wildfire risk, allowing fires to start more easily and burn hotter. These trends of longer wildfire seasons and larger wildfire size are predicted to continue as more frequent and longer droughts occur.  In addition to climate change, other factors—land use, large-scale insect infestation, fuel availability (including invasive species such as highly flammable cheatgrass), and management practices, including fire suppression—play an important role in wildfire frequency and intensity. All of these factors influencing wildfires vary greatly by region and over time, as do precipitation, wind, temperature, vegetation types, and landscape conditions. Therefore, understanding changes in fire characteristics requires long-term records, a regional perspective, and consideration of many factors. Wildfires have the potential to harm property, livelihoods, and human health. Fire-related threats are increasing, especially as more people live in and near forests, grasslands, and other natural areas.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, between 1980 and 2023 the United States had 22 wildfire events that individually caused more than $1 billion in damage; 18 of those have occurred since 2000.  Over the past few decades, the United States has routinely spent more than $1 billion per year to fight wildfires, including $3.5 billion in 2022.  These efforts have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of firefighters.  Even in communities far downwind, wildfire smoke has been directly linked to poor air quality that can lead to significant health effects and costs to society (emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and deaths, often due to respiratory ailments). Beyond the human and societal impacts, wildfires also affect the Earth’s climate. Forests in particular store large amounts of carbon. When they burn, they immediately release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which in turn contributes to climate change. After burning, forests also release carbon dioxide more gradually through decomposition. This indicator defines a wildfire as \"a wildland fire originating from an unplanned ignition, such as lightning, volcanos, unauthorized and accidental human caused fires, and prescribed fires that are declared wildfires.”  This indicator tracks four aspects of wildfires over time: the total number of fires (frequency), the total land area burned (extent), the degree of damage that fires cause to the landscape (severity), and the acreage burned by fires starting in each month of the year (seasonal patterns). The total area and total number of fires are tracked by the National Interagency Fire Center, which compiles reports from local, state, and federal agencies that are involved in fighting wildfires. The U.S. Forest Service tracked similar data using a different reporting system until 1997. Those data have been added to this indicator for comparison. Burn severity, state-level acreage, and monthly totals are based on data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project, which provides the location, ignition date, size, and other statistics for every individual wildfire that meets certain size criteria (≥ 1,000 acres in the western United States or ≥ 500 acres in the eastern United States). MTBS compares the “greenness” of satellite images taken before and after a fire to classify how severely the land has been burned. Burn severity provides an indication of the ecological damage and how long the effects of wildfires are likely to last. Although some nationwide fire data have been collected since the early 1900s, this indicator starts in 1983 (Figures 1 and 2) and 1984 (Figures 3 through 7), when nationwide data collection became more complete and standardized. EPA divided the time period in Figures 5, 6, and 7 into two roughly equal halves to compare changes in wildfire characteristics over time. Many environmental impacts associated with climate change can affect the severity and timing of the wildfire season, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and drought. Short-term weather conditions (dryness, temperature, wind, lightning) influence the likelihood of ignition, where and how quickly a fire spreads, and how big it gets. Longer-term climate patterns also play a role by creating conditions that may be conducive to wildfire (for example, a multi-year regional drought). Human activities and land management practices also affect wildfire activity, and preferred practices in wildfire management have evolved over time, from older policies that favored complete wildfire prevention to more recent policies of wildfire suppression and controlled burns. Resources available to fight and manage wildfires can also influence the amount of area burned over time. While this indicator is limited to “wildland” fires, it includes fires that encroach on—or perhaps started in—developed areas. Increased development in previously wild lands could also influence trends in wildfire frequency and extent. The total number of fires may also vary due to reporting irregularities, as fires that split or merge together across jurisdictional lines may be counted differently. Along with the influence of ongoing climate change, wildfire patterns can be influenced by natural climate cycles that tend to shift every few decades. Thus, with less than four decades of data shown here, it might be challenging to draw conclusions about long-term trends. While a longer record would be ideal, data from before 1983 are not consistent or detailed enough nationally to be included in this indicator. The full set of wildfire frequency and burned acreage data in Figures 1 and 2 comes from the National Interagency Fire Center, which compiles wildfire reports sent from local, state, and federal entities that are involved in fighting fires. These data are available online at:  . Additional data were provided by the U.S. Forest Service based on a different set of records, referred to as Smokey Bear Reports. Burn severity data, state-by-state acreage totals, and monthly acreage data in Figures 3 through 7 come from the MTBS multi-agency project, which maintains a database of wildfire events across the United States.

Ecosystems provide humans with food, clean water, and a variety of other services that can be affected by climate change. This chapter looks at some of the ways that climate change affects ecosystems, including changes in wildfires, streams and lakes, bird migration patterns, fish and shellfish populations, and plant growth. Changes in the Earth’s climate can affect ecosystems by altering the water cycle, habitats, animal behavior—such as nesting and migration patterns—and the timing of natural processes such as flower blooms. Changes that disrupt the functioning of ecosystems may increase the risk of harm or even extinction for some species. While wildfires occur naturally, more frequent and more intense fires can significantly disrupt ecosystems, damage property, put people and communities at risk, and create air pollution problems even far away from the source. While plants and animals have adapted to environmental change for millions of years, the climate changes being experienced now could require adaptation on larger and faster scales than current species have successfully achieved in the past, thus increasing the risk of extinction or severe disruption for many species."},

This indicator depicts changes in the length of ragweed pollen season in the United States and Canada. This figure shows how the length of ragweed pollen season changed at 11 locations in the central United States and Canada between 1995 and 2015. Red circles represent a longer pollen season; the blue circle represents a shorter season. Larger circles indicate larger changes. Data source: Ziska et al., 2016 \n Allergies are a major public health concern, with hay fever (congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes) accounting for more than 13 million visits to physicians’ offices and other medical facilities every year.  One of the most common environmental allergens is ragweed, which can cause hay fever and trigger asthma attacks, especially in children and the elderly.  An estimated 15.5 percent of all Americans are sensitive to ragweed. Ragweed plants mature in mid-summer and produce small flowers that generate pollen. Ragweed pollen season usually peaks in late summer and early fall, but these plants often continue to produce pollen until the first frost. A single ragweed plant can produce up to a billion pollen grains in one season, and these grains can be carried long distances by the wind. Climate change can affect pollen allergies in several ways. Warmer spring temperatures cause some plants to start producing pollen earlier (see the   indicator), while warmer fall temperatures extend the growing season for other plants, such as ragweed (see the   indicator). Warmer temperatures and increased carbon dioxide concentrations also lead ragweed and other plants to produce more pollen, and the pollen they produce is more allergenic. This means that many locations could experience longer allergy seasons and higher pollen counts as a result of climate change. This indicator shows changes in the length of the ragweed pollen season in 11 cities in the central United States and Canada. These locations were selected as part of a study that looked at trends in pollen season at sites similar in elevation, but across a range of latitudes from south to north. At each location, air samples have been collected and examined since at least the 1990s as part of a national allergy monitoring network. Pollen spores are counted and identified using microscopes. Pollen counts from each station have been analyzed to determine the start and end dates of each year’s ragweed pollen season. Because the length of ragweed season naturally varies from year to year, statistical techniques have been used to determine the average rate of change over time. This indicator shows the total change in season length from 1995 to 2015, which was determined by multiplying the average annual rate of change by the number of years in the period. This indicator is based on data from a limited number of cities in the central states and provinces. These cities cover a broad range from north to south, however, which allows researchers to establish a clear connection between pollen season changes and latitude. Many factors can influence year-to-year changes in pollen season, including typical local and regional variations in temperature and precipitation, extreme events such as floods and droughts, and changes in plant diversity. In addition, seasonal pollen production may differ between stations located in densely urbanized areas and stations in outlying areas. Adding more years of data would provide a better picture of long-term trends, but widespread data were not available prior to 1995. This indicator does not show how the intensity of ragweed pollen season (pollen counts) might also be changing. Data for this indicator come from the National Allergy Bureau, which is part of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology’s Aeroallergen Network. Data were compiled and analyzed by a team of researchers that published a more detailed version of this analysis in a scientific journal with data through 2009."},

This indicator shows changes in growing degree days, which can signal changes in the timing and length of pollen seasons in the United States. This map shows trends in the total number of growing degree days per year at 280 weather stations. The color and size of the symbols represent percent change between 1948 and 2023, based on the long-term average rate of change. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n Increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and changes in climate—such as increasing temperatures and altered precipitation patterns—are expected to contribute to increases in levels and distribution of plant pollen.   Pollen from trees and grasses is a common allergen that can trigger health effects such as allergic rhinitis (“hay fever”) and asthma. In the United States in 2021, 26 percent of adults reported having at least one seasonal allergy.   About 8 percent of adults and 6.5 percent of children also reported suffering from asthma, and this population of asthmatics accounts for about 1 million emergency department visits yearly.   These health effects lead to economic costs from medical expenses and missed work and school days. Asthma caused an estimated $50 billion in medical expenses and $3 billion in the value of lost work and school days in 2013.  Direct medical spending to treat hay fever was estimated at $3.4 billion in 2011.  Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native populations are particularly sensitive to longer pollen seasons because they have the highest rates of asthma in the United States, and urban Black and Hispanic children tend to experience more symptoms of hay fever. The timing of pollen seasons is linked to climate trends and variations, including changes in growing degree days—a widely used measure for tracking plant growth and development. As with the   indicator, growing degree days are based on temperature, because plants typically only grow when the temperature is above a certain minimum. Studies have shown that as growing degree days increase, grass pollen season grows longer and oak and birch pollen seasons begin earlier.   Earlier pollen season start dates are associated with a longer pollen season overall.   More broadly, growing degree days also affect plant growth, agricultural production, and the spread and impact of plant diseases and pests. Growing degree days are calculated using daily temperature data from weather stations. As with the   indicator, growing degree days are based on the number of degrees above a certain minimum temperature. Different plants have different temperature requirements, so EPA chose a baseline temperature of 50°F, which is commonly used for analysis when there are multiple plant species of interest. Using this baseline, a day with an average temperature of 70°F represents 20 growing degree days. This indicator examines changes in the number of growing degree days from 1948 to 2023 at locations across the United States. This indicator includes 280 weather stations operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration because they had sufficient data completeness during the entire period of record. For each station, daily growing degrees were calculated by taking the average of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, then subtracting 50°F. Daily results were added together to calculate total annual growing degree days for each year from 1948 to 2023. Figure 1 shows how the total number of growing degree days per year has changed over time at each location. Growing degree days reflect cumulative conditions that support plant development, but they do not capture potentially important factors related to the sequence of weather conditions, which can also have considerable effects on plant development. Factors other than growing degree days also affect pollen season duration and start date. Some of those factors relate to plant growth patterns, and some—such as local plant composition, geographic location (latitude), and proximity to urban areas—are not directly related to climate. As a result, the exact link between growing degree days and pollen season timing is not precise and may vary over time and at different locations. Also, a change in total growing degree days does not necessarily change the intensity of the pollen season. Nonetheless, because allergies are a major public health concern, observed changes in growing degree days, which serve as a proxy for changes in pollen season length and start date, provide insight into ways in which climate change may affect human well-being. Temperature data for this indicator come from the Global Historical Climatology Network, maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The analysis draws on prior research by Zhang et al. (2015) on the relationship between growing degree days and pollen."},

Neuroinvasive cases, which account for less than 1 percent of people infected with West Nile virus, are those that affect the brain or cause neurologic dysfunction. Data source: CDC, 2023 \n Climate change is expected to affect the geographic and seasonal patterns of vector-borne diseases (that is, diseases caused by pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, or other arthropods) in the United States.  West Nile virus was first detected in the United States in 1999 and is now the most common cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States in most years. While many infected people feel no symptoms, others can experience symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, as well as more severe damage to the central nervous system in some patients, causing encephalitis, meningitis, and occasionally death.  From 1999 to 2021, a total of 55,443 cases of West Nile virus disease were reported in to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nearly half of the reported cases of people infected with West Nile virus were neuroinvasive—that is, affecting the brain or causing neurologic dysfunction.  Mosquitoes acquire the virus by biting infected birds, which are the main hosts of the virus. People are then infected when they are bitten by these virus-carrying mosquitoes. Climate change increases the risk of human exposure to West Nile virus. Studies show that warmer temperatures associated with climate change can accelerate mosquito development, biting rates, and the incubation of the disease within a mosquito.  The effect of climate change on the timing of bird migration and breeding patterns may also contribute to changes in long-range virus movement. Mild winters and drought have been associated with West Nile virus disease outbreaks,  while rainfall can also contribute by creating breeding sites for mosquitoes. Climate is just one of many important factors that influence the transmission, distribution, and incidence of West Nile virus disease. Human exposure to infected mosquitoes is also influenced by multiple factors, including changes in the proximity of human populations to mosquitoes and host bird species, increased awareness of West Nile virus, and modified behaviors, such as spending less time outdoors during peak mosquito-biting times and taking precautions to avoid being bitten. West Nile disease is one of many  . This indicator looks at the incidence of human cases of West Nile virus disease, which reflects the rate of new cases contracted in a given geographic area and time period. Incidence is typically calculated as the number of cases per 100,000 people per year. This indicator focuses on neuroinvasive cases, as the symptoms are noticeable and typically require medical care. The indicator summarizes surveillance data reported to the CDC. West Nile is a nationally notifiable disease, which means health care providers are required to report confirmed cases to their local or state health departments. CDC compiles these reported data and calculates national totals and rates. Figure 1 shows national incidence by year since 2002, when West Nile virus first became notifiable. Figure 2 shows the incidence for each state, averaged over the period from 2002 to 2021.  This indicator depends on clinicians making the correct diagnosis and reporting laboratory-confirmed cases to public health authorities. Changes in diagnosing practices, awareness of the virus, and mosquito control efforts over time can affect trends. Cases are reported based on the patient’s state of residence, which is not necessarily the place where they were infected. Non-neuroinvasive cases of West Nile virus disease have been tracked since 2005, but because the symptoms may be mild or undetected they are significantly underreported.  Thus, this indicator only focuses on neuroinvasive cases. Because of the many factors affecting mosquito populations and reporting of West Nile virus disease and the fact that data have only been collected for a little more than a decade, this indicator does not provide sufficient information to determine what proportion of the observed changes in incidence is directly driven by climate change. Further study is critical to improving the usefulness of this indicator and informing decisions affecting public health.

This indicator tracks the rate of reported Lyme disease cases across the United States. This figure shows the annual incidence of Lyme disease, which is calculated as the number of new cases per 100,000 people. The graph is based on cases that local and state health departments report to CDC’s national disease tracking system. Data source: CDC, 2019 \n This map shows how reported Lyme disease incidence has changed by state since 1991, based on the number of new cases per 100,000 people. The total change has been estimated from the average annual rate of change in each state. This map is limited to the 15 states where Lyme disease is most common, where annual rates are consistently above 10 cases per 100,000 people. Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island have had changes in reporting methods that make it difficult to calculate an accurate trend. Data source: CDC, 2019 \n These maps show the distribution of Lyme disease cases reported to CDC in 1996 and 2018. Each dot represents an individual case placed according to the patient’s county of residence, which may be different from the county of exposure. The year 1996 was chosen as a reasonable starting point for comparison with recent years. These maps focus on the parts of the United States where Lyme disease is most common. The lack of dots in Massachusetts in 2018 is due to a difference in reporting standards, not an absence of Lyme disease. Data source: CDC, 2019 \n Lyme disease is a bacterial illness that can cause fever, fatigue, joint pain, and skin rash, as well as more serious joint and nervous system complications. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease (that is, a disease transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas) in the United States. In recent years, approximately 20,000–30,000 confirmed cases of Lyme disease per year have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  However, the actual number of illnesses is likely greater than what is reported to health officials.  Lyme disease is transmitted through the bite of certain species of infected ticks (referred to commonly as deer ticks) that carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. These ticks live not only on deer, but also on rodents, birds, and other host animals. Deer do not harbor the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, but certain other hosts such as white-footed mice do, and ticks pick up the bacteria by feeding on these infected hosts. Studies provide evidence that climate change has contributed to the expanded range of ticks,  increasing the potential risk of Lyme disease, such as in areas of Canada where the ticks were previously unable to survive. The life cycle and prevalence of deer ticks are strongly influenced by temperature.   For example, deer ticks are mostly active when temperatures are above 45˚F, and they thrive in areas with at least 85-percent humidity. Thus, warming temperatures associated with climate change are projected to increase the range of suitable tick habitat and are, therefore, one of multiple factors driving the observed spread of Lyme disease.  Because tick activity depends on temperatures being above a certain minimum, shorter winters could also extend the period when ticks are active each year, increasing the time that humans could be exposed to Lyme disease. Unlike some other vector-borne diseases, tick-borne disease patterns are generally less influenced by short-term changes in weather (weeks to months) than by longer-term climate change. Climate is just one of many important factors that influence the transmission, distribution, and incidence of Lyme disease. Other factors that affect the number of Lyme disease cases include changes in the populations of host species (particularly deer), which affect tick population size. The percentage of ticks that are infected depends on the prevalence and infection rates of white-footed mice and certain other hosts. Host species populations and habitats can be affected by climate change and other ecosystem disturbances. Human exposure to infected ticks is also influenced by factors such as changes in the proximity of human populations to ticks and other hosts, increased awareness of Lyme disease, and modified behaviors, such as spending less time outdoors, taking precautions against being bitten, and checking more carefully for ticks. Occupation influences exposure, as people who work outdoors, like farmers and landscapers, may be especially at risk.   Lyme disease is one of many  . This indicator looks at the incidence of Lyme disease, which reflects the rate of new cases contracted in a given geographic area and time period. Incidence is typically calculated as the number of cases per 100,000 people per year. Annual Lyme disease totals and rates for each state were provided by CDC. The original data were collected by state and local health departments, which track confirmed cases of Lyme disease that are diagnosed by health care providers and report these cases to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. Nationwide reporting of Lyme disease began in 1991. Figure 1 shows the national incidence of Lyme disease since 1991, and Figure 2 shows trends in incidence over time in 15 states that collectively account for about 95 percent of the nation’s reported cases. To illustrate changes in the distribution of reported cases over time, maps of the years 1996 and 2018 are presented side by side. For consistency, this indicator includes only data for confirmed cases of Lyme disease that are reported to CDC, not cases that are considered “probable.” Changes in diagnosing practices and awareness of the disease over time can affect trends. Cases are reported based on the patient’s county of residence, which is not necessarily the place where they were infected. Risk of infection is focused in certain regions of the country, and confirmed reports from low-incidence states are often the result of travel to an area of higher incidence. Evidence suggests that expanding ranges of ticks in certain northern states may be more related to a warming climate than expanding ranges in southern states.   Because of the many factors affecting tick populations and reporting of Lyme disease, though, this indicator does not provide sufficient information to determine what proportion of the observed changes in Lyme disease incidence is directly driven by climate change. Further study is critical to improving the usefulness of this indicator and informing decisions affecting public health.

This indicator examines trends related to home air conditioning and heating by tracking the amount of electricity used by U.S. homes in the summer and energy used in the winter. This graph shows the amount of electricity used by the average American during the summer months (June, July, and August) of each year from 1973 to 2022. The solid line shows average summer electricity use per capita, and it represents all 50 states plus D.C.

The solid line shows average winter natural gas use per capita, and it represents all 50 states plus D.C. For reference, the dashed line shows the average number of heating degree days for the same months across the contiguous 48 states plus D.C. Data sources: EIA, 2022 ;  BEA, 2022 ;  NOAA, 2022 \n Hot weather can be uncomfortable, and in extreme cases dangerous (see the   indicator). One way people respond to hot weather is by using air conditioning. Air conditioning is the primary way to cool a home and has become more widely used over time; as of 2015, it accounted for 17 percent of the electricity that the average American household uses every year.  Conversely, cold weather requires people to use energy to heat their homes, using electricity and fuels such as natural gas, propane, and oil. As climate change contributes to an increase in average temperatures and unusually hot days, Americans are expected to use more energy—mostly electricity for air conditioning. As a result, people will likely have to spend more money on electricity for cooling.  Increased use of air conditioning could also lead to more greenhouse gas emissions and further climate change, because more electricity must be generated to meet this increased demand. As of 2021, about three-fifths of the electricity in the United States was generated by burning fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas.  Burning fossil fuels for electricity is one of the largest sources of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions in the United States (see the   indicator). The opposite effect could take place with winter heating. As temperatures rise, Americans are expected to use less fuel energy for heating their homes.  Overall, though, summer increases in energy use are expected to outweigh any reduction due to lower heating needs in the winter.   Improvements in energy efficiency, particularly for electricity-based heating and cooling, can influence residential consumption and demand for energy over time. This indicator measures changes in residential seasonal energy use in the United States. It has two components: The data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), which collects comprehensive information about power generation, delivery, and sales from electric power utilities across the country. EIA has collected these data consistently since 1973. For this indicator, EPA divided total residential electricity sales for the summer months by the corresponding total U.S. population to calculate summer electricity use per capita, which Figure 1 shows in kilowatt-hours per person. EPA used a similar method with winter residential natural gas sales, which Figure 2 shows in cubic feet per person. For reference, Figure 1 also shows summer cooling   for each year, while Figure 2 shows winter heating degree days for each year (see the   indicator). In general, more cooling degree days and fewer heating degree days means a combination of more warm days and warmer temperatures on those days. Residential electricity and natural gas use cover all 50 states plus Washington D.C., while cooling and heating degree days are shown for the contiguous 48 states plus D.C., as they are not routinely calculated for Alaska and Hawaii. This indicator is based on residential retail electricity and natural gas sales. In the case of electricity, sales are not exactly the same as total residential electricity use, because sales data do not count electricity that people generate and consume onsite—for example, using rooftop solar panels. For context, residential solar generated an estimated 33,600 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2021, which translates to 2.3 percent of total residential retail sales.  As more people produce their own power and buy less electricity from a utility, sales data could increasingly underestimate the actual amount of electricity used. However, retail sales data are still the best available approximation for energy use nationwide . Outdoor air temperature is not the only weather-related factor that influences energy use (humidity and dew point also matter, for example), but it is still a major driver of the amount of electricity and natural gas people use in their homes. That said, rising temperatures are not the only reason why people might use more electricity in the summer and less natural gas in the winter. One possible factor affecting electricity and natural gas use is where people live. Over the past several decades, the fastest-growing parts of the United States have been in the South and West, which means a growing share of the U.S. population lives in warmer places. The “cooling degree days” line in Figure 1 and the “heating degree days” line in Figure 2 adjust for where people lived as of the 2010 census but do not adjust for changes in population distribution over time. Other factors include characteristics of people’s homes and the air conditioning and heating equipment they use. As of 2020, 88 percent of U.S. homes use some type of air conditioning, and 66 percent have central air conditioning installed.  These numbers have increased over time, as has the size of the average American home, which means more space to heat and cool. Conversely, homes have become more energy efficient over time (for example, through better insulation), and air conditioning and heating equipment has also become more efficient. Electricity and natural gas use could also reflect utility prices (when rates are higher, people may choose to reduce their use) and the amount of electricity and natural gas that Americans use for other needs. Other considerations include whether new homes rely on electricity or gas for cooking, water heating, and other activities, and shifts towards the use of innovative electronic appliances over time. Even with all these factors at work, many studies agree that rising temperatures can and will lead to increased use of electricity, as well as reduced use of heating fuels in winter. The data for this indicator were provided by EIA, which maintains a large collection of information about how the United States produces and uses electricity and other forms of energy. EIA’s energy sales data can be found online at:   and  . EPA developed this indicator using two additional sources: population data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and cooling and heating degree days from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. To determine a \"degree day,\" EPA compares the daily average outdoor temperature with a defined baseline temperature for indoor comfort (in this case, 65°F). For example, if the average temperature on a particular day is 78°F, then that day counts as 13 cooling degree days, as a building's interior would need to be cooled by 13°F to reach 65°F. If the average outdoor temperature is 34°F, then that day counts as 31 heating degree days, as a building's interior would need to be warmed by 31°F to reach 65°F."},

Click on a state to reveal the trend in a line graph. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n Outdoor temperatures can affect daily life in many ways. In particular, temperature affects our health, comfort level, and demand for heating and air conditioning. Collectively, heating and cooling the spaces in which we live accounts for 52 percent of the energy that American households use every year.  As climate change contributes to an increase in average temperatures, an increase in unusually hot days, and a decrease in unusually cold days (see the   and   indicators), the overall demand for heating is expected to decline and the demand for cooling is expected to increase. One way to measure the influence of temperature change on energy demand is using heating and cooling degree days, which measure the difference between outdoor temperatures and a temperature that people generally find comfortable indoors. These measurements suggest how much energy people might need to use to heat and cool their homes and workplaces, thus providing a sense of how climate change could affect people’s daily lives and finances. This indicator uses daily temperature data from thousands of weather stations across the United States to calculate heating and cooling degree days. A “degree day” is determined by comparing the daily average outdoor temperature with a defined baseline temperature for indoor comfort (in this case, 65°F). For example, if the average temperature on a particular day is 78°F, then that day counts as 13 cooling degree days, as a building’s interior would need to be cooled by 13°F to reach 65°F. Conversely, if the average outdoor temperature is 34°F, then that day counts as 31 heating degree days, as a building’s interior would need to be warmed by 31°F to reach 65°F. This does not mean that all people will actually heat or cool buildings to 65°F; it is just a number to allow for consistent comparisons over time and across the country. For reference, New York City experiences far more heating degree days than cooling degree days per year—a reflection of the relatively cool climate in the Northeast—while Houston, Texas, has far more cooling degree days than heating degree days—a reflection of the much warmer climate in the South. Figure 1 shows each year’s average heating and cooling degree days across the contiguous 48 states. Figures 2 and 3 show how heating and cooling degree days have changed by state, based on a comparison of the first 65 years of available data (1895–1959) with the most recent 64 years (1960–2023). State and national averages were calculated by finding the total number of heating and cooling degree days per year at each weather station, averaging the results from all stations within regions called climate divisions (each state within the contiguous 48 has up to 10 climate divisions), then calculating state and national averages weighted by the population of each climate division. With this population-weighting approach, average state and national heating and cooling degree days more closely reflect the conditions that the average resident would experience. Heating and cooling degree days suggest how temperature changes affect energy demand, but they do not necessarily reflect actual energy use. Many other factors have influenced energy demand over time, such as more energy-efficient heating systems, the introduction and increasingly widespread use of cooling technologies, larger but better-insulated homes, behavior change, and population shifts (such as more people moving to warmer regions). All of the population-weighting in this indicator is based on the population distribution according to the 2010 U.S. Census, so any changes in heating and cooling degree days over time in this indicator reflect actual changes in the climate, not the influence of shifting populations. A nationally applied baseline—in this case, 65°F—has certain limitations considering the various climate zones across the United States.

This indicator presents data on deaths classified as “cold-related” in the United States. This figure shows the annual rates for deaths classified as “cold-related” by medical professionals in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The orange line shows deaths for which cold was listed as the main (underlying) cause.* The blue line shows deaths for which cold was listed as either the underlying or contributing cause of death, based on a broader set of data that became available in 1999. * Between 1998 and 1999, the World Health Organization revised the international codes used to classify causes of death. As a result, data from earlier than 1999 cannot easily be compared with data from 1999 and later. Data source: CDC, 2018  \n In recent years, U.S. death rates in winter months have been 8 to 12 percent higher than in non-winter months.  Much of this increase relates to seasonal changes in behavior and the human body, as well as increased exposure to respiratory diseases. Cold temperatures can also worsen pre-existing medical conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. For example, death rates from heart attacks increase as temperatures drop, likely due to the way cold affects blood circulation, blood vessels, and other factors.  Even moderately cold days can increase the risk of death for many people. People exposed to extremely cold conditions can also suffer from direct effects such as frostbite and potentially deadly hypothermia, especially in places where people are not accustomed to cold temperatures. Certain population groups face higher risks of cold-related illness or death. For example, occupational groups that work outdoors during winter months, such as agricultural workers, construction workers, and electricity and pipeline utility workers, face higher risks of exposure to cold.  Others at risk include older adults, infants, people with pre-existing medical conditions, people taking medications or using drugs (especially alcohol) that make them more susceptible to cold effects, homeless people, and those with inadequate winter clothing or home heating. Unusually cold winter temperatures have become less common across the contiguous 48 states in recent decades,  particularly very cold nights (see the   indicator). Extreme cold waves are likely to continue to decrease as winter temperatures increase in the future.  This winter warming is expected to reduce the number of direct cold-related deaths, but the decrease is projected to be smaller than increases in heat-related deaths (see the   indicator) in most regions.  This is because some of the factors that lead to higher death rates in the winter are not particularly sensitive to climate change,  because extreme heat has a more immediate and direct effect on death rates than extreme cold,  and because the solutions to protect against cold exposure (such as staying indoors, wearing more clothing, turning on the heat) are more widely accessible than protection against extreme heat.  Cold-related death rates can change as communities strengthen their cold weather plans and take other steps to protect vulnerable people during cold winter months. Like the   indicator, this indicator shows the annual rate for deaths classified by medical professionals as “cold-related” in the United States based on death certificate records. Every death is recorded on a death certificate, where a medical professional identifies the main cause of death (also known as the underlying cause), along with other conditions that contributed to the death. These causes are classified using a set of standard codes. Dividing the annual number of deaths by the U.S. population in that year, then multiplying by one million, will result in the death rates (per million people) that this indicator shows. Figure 1 shows cold-related death rates using two methods. One method shows deaths for which exposure to excessive natural cold was stated as the underlying cause of death from 1979 to 2016. The other data series shows deaths for which cold was listed as either the underlying cause or a contributing cause, based on a broader set of data that, at present, can only be evaluated for the years 1999 to 2015. For example, in a case where cardiovascular disease was determined to be the underlying cause of death, cold could be listed as a contributing factor because it can make the individual more susceptible to the effects of this disease. Several factors influence the ability of this indicator to estimate the true number of deaths associated with exposure to cold temperatures. Some cold-related deaths are not identified as such by the medical examiner and might not be properly coded on the death certificate. In many cases, the medical examiner might classify the cause of death as a cardiovascular or respiratory disease, not knowing for certain whether cold was a contributing factor. Furthermore, deaths can occur from exposure to cold (either as an underlying cause or as a contributing factor) that is not classified as extreme and therefore is often not recorded as such. These factors are similar to the factors that likely lead to undercounting of heat-related deaths (see the Heat-Related Deaths indicator), except that the effects of cold on the body tend to persist for longer than the effects of heat,  which could make it even more difficult to connect deaths to exposures. Classifying a death as “cold-related” does not mean that cold temperatures were the only factor that caused or contributed to the death, as pre-existing medical conditions can significantly increase an individual’s susceptibility to cold temperatures. Other important factors, such as the overall vulnerability of the population, and the extent to which people have adapted and acclimated to cold temperatures, can also affect trends in cold-related deaths. Some deaths classified as “cold-related” reflect human behavior more than weather conditions—for instance, deaths in which alcohol abuse increased a person's susceptibility to cold weather, falling into cold water (which can cause hypothermia, even in non-winter months), or getting lost on a wilderness excursion. This indicator includes these types of deaths. Data for this indicator were provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The 1979–2016 underlying cause data in Figure 1 are publicly available through the CDC WONDER database at:  .

This graph shows the annual rate of hospitalizations classified as “heat-related” by medical professionals in 20 states that participate in CDC’s hospitalization tracking program, from 2001 to 2010. The rate is based on hospital discharge records for May 1 to September 30 of every year. The rate has been age-adjusted to account for the effects of population change over time—for example, if the proportion of older adults has increased.

Totals are broken out by sex and by age group. The graph shows 10-year totals based on hospital discharge records for May 1 to September 30 of every year. Data source: Choudhary and Vaidyanathan, 2014 \n Heat-related illnesses can occur when a person is exposed to high temperatures, such that their body cannot cool itself sufficiently through sweating. Symptoms range from mild swelling, rashes, or cramps to potentially deadly heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States (see the   indicator), and it causes many people to visit the emergency room or be admitted to the hospital. Any person can suffer from heat stress, regardless of age, sex, or health status. Older adults and children, however, have a higher-than-average risk of becoming ill due to exposure to extreme heat.  People working outdoors, the socially isolated and economically disadvantaged, those with chronic illnesses, and some communities of color are also especially vulnerable to heat. Unusually hot summer temperatures have become more common across the contiguous 48 states in recent decades  (see the   indicator), and extreme heat events (heat waves) are expected to become more frequent and more intense in the future.  As a result, the risk of heat-related illness is expected to increase.  Hospitalization rates can also change, however, as people acclimate to higher temperatures and as communities strengthen their heat response plans and take other steps to continue to adapt. This indicator shows hospitalization rates for “heat-related” illnesses such as heat exhaustion, heat cramps, mild heat edema (swelling in the legs and hands), heat syncope (fainting), and heat stroke. It is based on hospital discharge records for patients who are admitted to the hospital for 23 hours or more. Every discharge record includes a diagnosis determined by a physician or other medical professional. This indicator covers states across a wide range of regions and climate zones that have participated in a national hospital data tracking program since at least 2001. All of these states require hospitals to submit discharge data to a state organization, which then compiles and reports the data to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dividing the annual number of hospitalizations by the corresponding state population, then multiplying by 100,000, gives the hospitalization rates (per 100,000 people) shown in this indicator. Figure 1 shows annual hospitalization rates, averaged over a group of 20 states. Figure 2 shows state-specific rates for 23 states, averaged over the period from 2001 to 2010. Figure 3 shows the total number of hospitalizations across the same 20 states shown in Figure 1, broken out by sex and by age group. Because excessive heat events are associated with summer months, this indicator is limited to hospitalizations occurring in May through September. Reporting of illnesses and processing of records can involve a time lag of several years, so this indicator currently only shows data through 2010. Several factors influence this indicator’s ability to estimate the true number of hospitalizations associated with extreme heat events: the indicator is limited to a subset of states; it uses records that have only been collected comprehensively since 2001; it relies on the judgment of thousands of individual medical professionals to accurately diagnose and explicitly document heat-related illnesses; and it assumes that hospitals fulfill their state-mandated reporting obligations. Nonetheless, this data set represents the best available source of observed data for tracking heat-related hospitalizations across multiple states. Focusing exclusively on the months from May 1 to September 30 may help to exclude incorrect reports, but it could also exclude legitimate heat-related illnesses that occur in other months. Hospitals’ practice of recording heat stress as a diagnosis does not signify that high temperatures are the only factor that causes or contributes to a hospitalization. Pre-existing medical conditions can significantly increase an individual’s vulnerability to heat. Other important factors, such as the overall vulnerability of the population, the extent to which people have adapted and acclimated to higher temperatures, and the local climate and topography, can affect trends in “heat-related” hospitalizations. Heat response measures, such as early warning and surveillance systems, air conditioning, health care, public education, cooling centers, infrastructure standards, and air quality management, can also make a big difference in heat-related hospitalization rates.  Data for this indicator were provided by CDC.

This feature presents data on worker deaths classified as “heat-related” in the United States and explores factors that influence exposure and vulnerability to heat. This graph shows the number of reported occupational heat-related deaths in the United States each year. The blue portions of the bars show deaths in the construction sector and the orange portions show deaths in all other sectors of the economy. The dashed lines indicate when BLS changed how it classifies “construction” (1996/1997 and 2002/2003) or changed its thresholds for reporting individual industry totals (2018/2019). Total construction sector deaths in 2019 fell below the new threshold; for that year, BLS combined construction into a single “all-industry” total rather than reporting a sector total. BLS has indicated that data collection for 2020 fell below reporting thresholds. Data source: BLS, 2024   \n This map shows the percentage of each county’s workforce engaged in occupations that typically involve a substantial amount of time outdoors. Job categories included in this analysis include delivery services, law enforcement and emergency services, utilities, mining/quarrying/oil and gas extraction, agriculture, fishing, forestry, and construction. The map shows a five-year average. Data source: BLS, 2024 \n Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States (see the   indicator).  Over the last few decades, unusually hot summer days and nights have become more common across the contiguous 48 states (see the   indicator) and it is expected that extreme heat events will occur with greater frequency and intensity in the future.  Thus, heat-related deaths are also expected to increase,  although these increases may be tempered as people physiologically adapt to higher temperatures and as communities increase their resilience to heat. Outdoor workers, particularly those engaging in strenuous physical activity, disproportionately face greater heat-related health threats.  For example, construction workers represent only 6 percent of the total U.S. workforce, yet they account for more than one-third of all reported occupational deaths associated with heat exposure.  Farmworkers also have disproportionately high rates of heat-related illnesses and deaths.  Worker safety and productivity will likely be increasingly challenged as temperatures outdoors continue to rise.  To reduce risks, employers can implement preventative measures such as ensuring access to water, training workers to recognize signs of heat-related illnesses, mandating frequent breaks and shade, providing heat-appropriate protective equipment, and limiting work during the hottest times of day.  Several states have enacted rules to mandate these types of practices, as tracked by organizations like the  . For more information, see the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA’s) worker safety website:   and:  .  This feature tracks the number of workers who died as a result of heat exposure on the job in the United States from 1992 to 2022. These data are compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) from multiple sources. Many of these cases are tracked by OSHA, which requires all employers under its jurisdiction to report any work-related death. Additional information comes from other federal agencies (including the military), state agencies, death certificates and autopsy reports, and other corroborating evidence. The cause of death and other details about each fatal incident are transcribed and coded using standardized classification systems. This feature focuses on cases whose “source of injury” was coded as “Heat—environmental”: that is, deaths caused by high temperatures that occur indoors or outdoors. Figure 1 shows the total number of heat-related deaths per year. It also shows the number of deaths specific to the construction sector, which is consistently the sector with the most heat-related deaths. Highlighting the intersections of climate hazards, such as extreme heat, and social vulnerability can help identify people and places most at risk. Outdoor workers, particularly those engaging in strenuous physical activity, disproportionately face heat-related health threats. Between 5 million and 10 million American workers are exposed to outdoor heat beyond safe levels every year.  Outdoor occupations are distributed throughout the United States, and they make up an especially large percentage of the workforce in certain regions (Example 1), including parts of the West, northern and southern Great Plains, and Alaska. Outdoor workers in cities may also be exposed to elevated temperatures due to the  , which can increase temperatures by 18 to 27°F during the day and 9 to 18°F at night in urban areas compared with outlying areas.   This feature counts deaths in workplaces of all types and sizes. It is not limited to establishments that fall under the jurisdiction of OSHA or other specific agencies. Several factors influence the ability of this feature to estimate the true number of occupational heat-related deaths. As discussed in the   indicator, deaths classified as heat-related may have other important contributing causes. Conversely, deaths associated with extreme heat are not always reported as such. Unlike the Heat-Related Deaths indicator, though, this feature is based on many types of corroborating evidence in addition to death certificates. A fraction of deaths may go unreported by employers, may not be properly categorized as heat-related, or may not be attributed to an occupational cause if the death occurs off the job site (for example, after the employee has left work for the day).  The underreporting rate is believed to be larger in industries that tend to have more undocumented or short-term workers. This feature uses death counts rather than death rates. Reporting the total number of deaths per year is useful for communication because it puts the exact number of lives in perspective, but it does not account for changes over time in population or sector-specific employment. Improvements to the tracking of worker-related fatalities include standardization of employer and state reporting of work-related heat deaths.  Reporting of illnesses and injuries must be immediate to ensure that illnesses and deaths are not mis-classified or missed altogether. Data for this feature were provided by BLS. The data in Figure 1 are publicly available on the BLS Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities website at:  .

This indicator presents data on deaths classified as “heat-related” in the United States. This figure shows the annual rates for deaths classified as “heat-related” by medical professionals in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The orange line shows deaths for which heat was listed as the main (underlying) cause.* The blue line shows deaths for which heat was listed as either the underlying or the contributing cause of death in May–September, based on a broader set of data that became available in 1999 and could be updated through 2021. * Between 1998 and 1999, the World Health Organization revised the international codes used to classify causes of death. As a result, data from earlier than 1999 cannot easily be compared with data from 1999 and later. Data source: CDC, 2024 \n This figure shows rates for deaths that medical professionals have classified as being caused by a combination of cardiovascular disease (diseases of the circulatory system) and heat exposure. This graph presents summer (May to September) death rates from 1999 to 2022 for three population groups in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The blue line shows rates for the entire population, the green line shows rates for non-Hispanic Black people, and the pink line shows rates for people aged 65 and older. Data source: CDC, 2024 \n Many factors can influence the nature, extent, and timing of health consequences associated with extreme heat events.  Studies of heat waves are one way to better understand health impacts, but different methods can lead to very different estimates of heat-related deaths. For example, during a severe heat wave that hit Chicago* between July 11 and July 27, 1995, 465 heat-related deaths were recorded on death certificates in Cook County.  However, studies that compared the total number of deaths during this heat wave (regardless of the recorded cause of death) with the long-term average of daily deaths found that the heat wave likely led to about 700 more deaths than would otherwise have been expected.  Differences in estimated heat-related deaths that result from different methods may be even larger when considering the entire nation and longer time periods. * This graph shows data for the Chicago Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. Data sources: CDC, 2012;  NOAA, 2012 \n When people are exposed to extreme heat, they can suffer from potentially deadly illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Hot temperatures can also contribute to deaths from heart attacks, strokes, and other forms of cardiovascular disease. According to the  , heat is a leading weather-related killer in the United States,  even though most heat-related deaths are preventable through outreach and intervention (see EPA’s   at:  ). Unusually hot temperatures have become more common across parts of the United States in recent decades  (see the   indicator), extreme heat events (heat waves) have become more frequent and intense throughout the country (see the   indicator), and these trends are expected to continue.  As a result, the risk of heat-related deaths and illness is also expected to increase unless people take steps to mitigate the impact or adapt.  The “heat island” effect accentuates the problem by causing even higher temperatures in densely developed urban areas.  Reductions in cold-related deaths are projected to be smaller than increases in heat-related deaths in most regions.  Death rates can also change, however, as people acclimate to higher temperatures and as communities strengthen their heat response plans and take other steps to continue to adapt Certain population groups already face higher risks of heat-related death and increases in summertime temperature variability will increase that risk.  The population of adults aged 65 and older, which is expected to continue to grow, has a higher-than-average risk of heat-related death. Children are particularly vulnerable to heat-related illness and death, as their bodies are less able to adapt to heat than adults, and they must rely on others to help keep them safe.  People with certain diseases, such as cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, are especially vulnerable to excessive heat exposure, as are the economically disadvantaged. Data also suggest a higher risk among non-Hispanic Black people. This indicator shows the annual rate for deaths classified by medical professionals as “heat-related” in the United States based on death certificate records. Every death is recorded on a death certificate, where a medical professional identifies the main cause of death (also known as the underlying cause), along with other conditions that contributed to the death. These causes are classified using a set of standard codes. Dividing the annual number of deaths by the U.S. population in that year, then multiplying by one million, will result in the death rates (per million people) that this indicator shows. Figure 1 shows heat-related death rates using two methods. One method shows deaths for which excessive natural heat was stated as the underlying cause of death from 1979 to 2022. The other data series shows deaths for which heat was listed as either the underlying cause or a contributing cause, based on a broader set of data that, at present, can only be evaluated from 1999 to 2021. For example, in a case where cardiovascular disease was determined to be the underlying cause of death, heat could be listed as a contributing factor because it can make the individual more susceptible to the effects of this disease. Because excessive heat events are associated with summer months, the contributing factor analysis was limited to May through September. Figure 2 offers a closer look at cardiovascular disease deaths for which heat was recorded as a contributing cause. This graph includes deaths due to heart attacks, strokes, and other diseases related to the circulatory system. Figure 2 shows death rates for the overall population as well as two groups with a higher risk: people age 65 and older and non-Hispanic Black people. Like the “underlying and contributing causes” analysis in Figure 1, Figure 2 is restricted to the summer months, and it uses data that are available from 1999 to 2022. Several factors influence the ability of this indicator to estimate the true number of deaths associated with extreme heat events. It has been well documented that many deaths associated with extreme heat are not identified as such by the medical examiner and might not be properly coded on the death certificate. In many cases, the medical examiner might classify the cause of death as a cardiovascular or respiratory disease, not knowing for certain whether heat was a contributing factor, particularly if the death did not occur during a well-publicized heat wave. Furthermore, deaths can occur from exposure to heat (either as an underlying cause or as a contributing factor) that is not classified as extreme and therefore is often not recorded as such. Some statistical approaches estimate that more than 1,300 deaths per year in the United States are due to extreme heat, compared with about 750 deaths per year in the “underlying and contributing causes” data set shown in Figure 1.  By studying how daily death rates vary with temperature in selected cities, scientists have found that extreme heat contributes to far more deaths than the official death certificates might suggest.  This is because the stress of a hot day can increase the chance of dying from a heart attack, other heart conditions, or respiratory diseases such as pneumonia.  These causes of death are much more common overall than dying directly from a heat-related illness such as heat stroke. Thus, this indicator very likely underestimates the number of deaths caused by exposure to heat. Classifying a death as “heat-related” does not mean that high temperatures were the only factor that caused or contributed to the death, as pre-existing medical conditions can significantly increase an individual’s susceptibility to heat. Other important factors, such as the overall vulnerability of the population, the extent to which people have adapted and acclimated to higher temperatures, and the local climate and topography, can affect trends in heat-related deaths. Heat response measures, such as early warning and surveillance systems, air conditioning, health care, public education, cooling centers, infrastructure standards, and air quality management, can also make a big difference in reducing death rates. For example, after a 1995 heat wave, the city of Milwaukee developed a plan for responding to extreme heat conditions; during a 1999 heat wave, heat-related deaths were roughly half of what would have been expected. Future development related to this indicator should focus on capturing   heat-related deaths, not just those with a reported link to heat stress. Starting in 2018, the source data began to provide separate counts for people who belong to more than one racial group. Prior to 2018, some of these individuals might have been classified as Black. This change has a small effect on the “non-Hispanic Black people” data in Figure 2, but not enough to change the shape of the line or the conclusions that can be drawn. The technical documentation for this indicator explains the change in more detail. Data for this indicator were provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The underlying cause data in Figure 1 are publicly available through the CDC WONDER database at:  . The contributing factor analysis in Figure 1 was developed by CDC’s Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, which provides a summary at:  .

Changes in the Earth’s climate can affect public health, agriculture, water supplies, energy production and use, land use and development, and recreation. The nature and extent of these effects, and whether they will be harmful or beneficial, will vary regionally and over time. This chapter looks at some of the ways that climate change is affecting human health and society, including changes in Lyme disease, West Nile virus, ragweed pollen season, heat- and cold-related deaths and hospitalizations, heating and cooling needs, and the agricultural growing season across the United States. Because impacts on human health are complex, often indirect, and dependent on multiple societal and environmental factors (including how people respond to these impacts), the development of appropriate health-related climate indicators is challenging and still emerging. It is important for health-related climate indicators to be clear, measurable, and timely to better understand the link between climate change and health effects. Changes in climate affect the average weather conditions to which we are accustomed. These changes can result in multiple threats to human health and welfare. Warmer average temperatures will likely lead to hotter days and more frequent and longer heat waves, which could increase the number of heat-related illnesses and deaths. Increases in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events, such as storms, could increase the risk of dangerous flooding, high winds, and other direct threats to people and property. Warmer temperatures could also reduce air quality by increasing the chemical reactions that produce smog, and, along with changes in precipitation patterns and extreme events, could enhance the spread of some diseases. In addition, climate change could require adaptation on larger and faster scales than in the past, presenting challenges to human well-being and the economy. The more extensively and more rapidly the climate changes, the larger the potential effects on society. The extent to which climate change will affect different regions and sectors of society will depend not only on the sensitivity of those systems to climate change, but also on their ability to adapt to or cope with climate change. Populations of particular concern include the poor, the elderly, those already in poor health, the disabled, and indigenous populations."},

This indicator tracks the number of days the U.S. and North American landscape is not frozen. This figure shows the number of days the ground is considered unfrozen in the contiguous 48 states compared with the 1979–2021 average.

Choosing a different long-term average for comparison would not change the shape of the data over time. Data source: Kim and Kimball, 2022 \n This map of North America shows where the number of annual unfrozen days either increased or decreased from 1979 to 2021. Colors show total change over this 42-year period, based on the long-term average rate of change. Dark gray areas were not included in this analysis because they are either open water, barren land, permanently frozen (glaciers, for example), or land that almost never freezes. Data source: Kim and Kimball, 2022 \n The freezing point (32°F) is a critical temperature threshold for many aspects of life. The number and timing of days with temperatures below freezing affect ecosystems and many sectors of the economy. For example, many crops only grow during periods when they are not limited by frost damage. The number of days below freezing during a year determines which plants can thrive, what food sources are available for animals, and when and how animals migrate or hibernate. Freezing temperatures also help reduce populations of certain insects and other pests that can damage crops and forests or spread diseases to humans (see the   indicator, for example); conversely, a mild winter with fewer days of frost can lead to more of these pests during the following spring and summer.   Temperatures below freezing also allow precipitation to fall as snow rather than rain (see the   indicator), which is important for regional water supplies and for places where winter activities, like skiing and snowmobiling, are an important part of the economy. Regional temperature conditions also drive the freezing and thawing of lakes and rivers (see   and  , for example). As the Earth’s climate warms overall (see the   indicator), the number of days below freezing has decreased in most parts of the United States. Continued reduction in frozen days could lead to a variety of effects on ecosystems, drought, wildfire risk, agriculture, natural resources, and the economy. This indicator tracks the total number of unfrozen days per year in the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. Here, a “frozen day” is any day in which frozen conditions are present at ground level in both morning and evening. An “unfrozen day” is the opposite. The indicator is based on satellite measurements that detect whether the land surface is frozen. For a broader perspective, it also shows results in a map for North America. It is complementary to EPA’s   indicator, but rather than relying on temperature thresholds, it offers a unique perspective based on ecologically relevant physical changes from different data sources and calculations. This indicator focuses on whether the landscape itself is frozen (i.e., frozen conditions are present at ground level), and it counts all frozen or unfrozen days throughout the year. In contrast, the growing season indicator is based on air temperatures and it focuses on one continuous stretch of days between the last frost of spring and the first frost of fall. This indicator was developed by dividing the country into a grid with thousands of cells, using satellite measurements to calculate the number of unfrozen days in each cell for every year, and then averaging all the grid cells together. Figures 1 and 2 show annual averages for the contiguous 48 states and Alaska, respectively. These graphs compare the number of unfrozen days per year against the 1979–2021 long-term average. Figure 3 shows how the annual average change for this period looks geographically. The calculations for this indicator include all land areas that experience freeze-thaw cycles that affect plant life—which means it does not cover areas that are permanently frozen, areas that never freeze, land with no plant life, or large bodies of water. At any given location, the number of days experiencing frozen conditions varies from year to year as a result of normal variation in weather patterns. With more than four decades of data, though, variability should not affect the conclusions that can be inferred from the long-term trends shown in this indicator. A decline in frozen conditions does not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in agricultural productivity. This is because plant productivity also depends on plant-specific temperature thresholds (some yields go down if temperatures get too warm), pollinators, and seasonal limitations in water and nutrient availability.  Agricultural production also depends on management activities (e.g., choice of crop varieties suited to changing climate conditions, timing of planting, irrigation, pesticide and fertilizer applications) and natural weather events, such as storms. This indicator differs from EPA’s   indicator because it is based on satellite data rather than on-the-ground weather stations, and because it counts the total number of unfrozen days throughout the year—not just the stretch of consecutive days between the last spring frost and the first fall frost. Both indicators are useful for different reasons: growing season is especially meaningful for agricultural crops, while a broader look at frozen conditions is important for understanding ecological impacts, including biological and hydrological processes. In addition, the satellite method used here can pick up local variations in areas that might not have many long-term weather stations that measure air temperature. The two indicators show similar patterns, which is consistent with multiple lines of evidence pointing to similar conclusions about the nation’s changing climate. This indicator is based on data collected by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellites and analyzed by the University of Montana. EPA’s indicator is an updated version of an analysis originally published in the scientific literature in 2017."},

This indicator shows trends in permafrost temperature at select sites in Alaska. This figure shows permafrost temperature at borehole sites in interior and northern Alaska, measured at the end of summer (approximately September of each year). Measurements at these sites were taken at depths between 49 and 85 feet. Data source: University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2023 \n This map shows the change in permafrost temperature per decade for long-term borehole sites in Alaska. Larger circles correspond to greater rates of warming per decade. The blue circle represents a cooling trend. Borehole measurement depths range from 49 to 85 feet. Data source: University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2023 \n Permafrost is defined as rock or soil that remains at or below the freezing point of 32°F for two or more years. Permafrost usually lies below an “active layer” of ground that freezes and thaws every year with seasonal changes in temperature.  Permafrost occurs in many different forms with various amounts of ice (continuous and discontinuous) and is mainly found in areas near the Arctic. In Alaska, about 80 percent of the ground has permafrost underneath it.  A key characteristic affecting the state of permafrost is the temperature at the ground surface and shallow depths. The seasonal timing, amount, and extent of snow cover (see the   indicator) also affect permafrost.  A warming climate has brought higher temperatures to Alaska and other areas with permafrost, causing some permafrost to thaw. While the impacts of climate change on permafrost vary at regional and local scales, permafrost thawing has been observed in many locations around the world. A thawing permafrost layer can lead to severe impacts on people and the environment. For instance, as ice-filled permafrost thaws, it can turn into a muddy slurry that cannot support the weight of the soil and vegetation above it. Infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and pipes could be damaged as permafrost thaws.  Infrastructure damage and erosion, due in part to permafrost thaw, has already caused some communities in western and southern Alaska to have to relocate. Additionally, organic matter (like the remains of plants) currently frozen in the permafrost will start to decompose when the ground thaws, resulting in the emission of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This contributes to further global climate change. For more than 40 years, a group of scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks has been studying permafrost across Alaska. They measure temperature every year in 15 boreholes drilled at least 50 feet deep and analyze the data for long-term trends. This data set provides valuable information about how rapid climate changes observed in Alaska are influencing permafrost. Because permafrost temperatures can also be influenced by land use change such as urban development, agriculture, and other human activities, this indicator focuses on a select set of boreholes that are relatively remote and undisturbed for better assessment of changes associated with climate. Figure 1 shows temperature measurements for each borehole site in the interior and northern Alaska regions. Figure 2 shows the long-term rate of permafrost temperature change per decade, for all boreholes. Some borehole sites used in this indicator rely on data collected at depths less than 65 feet, which may be influenced by seasonal or short-term surface temperature change. Additionally, some sites were not measured every year, creating gaps of two to four years, but all the sites included in this indicator meet minimum data completeness required for long-term change calculation. Logistical issues caused minor fluctuation in the exact timing of when measurements were collected each year, which could also add some uncertainty to the results. This collection of sites is not necessarily representative of all types of permafrost or all temperature trends throughout Alaska. Permafrost temperature can vary depending on local environmental factors such as soil type, vegetation characteristics, and snow cover depth. Notably, permafrost in northern Alaska is naturally colder and more continuous than permafrost in the interior region. The data in this indicator are based on seasonal measurements collected by researchers and provided by Dr. Vladimir Romanovsky of the Permafrost Laboratory of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

Data source: USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2023 \n This map shows trends in the length of the snowpack season across the western United States, in days. Blue circles show where the season has grown longer; red circles show where it has become shorter. Data source: USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2023 \n Temperature and precipitation are key factors affecting snowpack, which is the amount or thickness of snow that accumulates on the ground. In a warming climate, more precipitation will be expected to fall as rain rather than snow in most areas—reducing the extent and depth of snowpack. Long-term observations across the contiguous 48 states show that nearly 80 percent of weather stations examined have experienced a decrease in the proportion of precipitation falling as snow (see the   indicator). In addition, with warmer winters and springs (see the   indicator), the seasonality of snowpack is also changing. Higher temperatures cause snow to melt earlier, which in turn affects the timing and availability of water. Mountain snowpack plays a key role in the water cycle in western North America, storing water in the winter when the snow falls and releasing it as runoff in spring and summer when the snow melts. Millions of people in the West depend on the melting of mountain snowpack for hydropower, irrigation, and drinking water. In most western river basins, snowpack is a larger component of water storage than human-constructed reservoirs.  Continued reductions in snowpack and shifts in snowmelt are expected in the future, which will reduce hydropower production in the West. Changes in mountain snowpack can affect agriculture, winter recreation, and tourism in some areas, as well as plants and wildlife. For example, certain types of trees rely on snow for insulation from freezing temperatures, as do some animal species. In addition, fish spawning could be disrupted if changes in snowpack or snowmelt alter the timing and abundance of streamflows. (For a look at long-term trends in the timing of spring snowmelt runoff in United States, see the   indicator.) Additionally, warming and earlier snowmelt accelerate the start of the wildfire season and promote more wildfire activity in the western United States and Alaska (see the   indicator).  Altogether, snowpack’s sensitivity to climate and its many related effects make this a valuable indicator to track.  This indicator uses a measurement called snow water equivalent to determine trends in snowpack. Snow water equivalent is the amount of water contained within the snowpack at a particular location. It can be thought of as the depth of water that would result if the entire snowpack were to melt. Figure 1 shows long-term rates of change for April 1, the most frequent observation date, because it could reflect changes in precipitation, and it is extensively used for spring streamflow and water supply forecasting. Figures 2 and 3 focus on the day of each year when snowpack is at its deepest (that is, peak snowpack) to determine if it is occurring earlier or later. Figure 4 shows changes in the length of the snowpack season, representing the number of days when the ground is covered by continuous snowpack. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and other collaborators have measured snowpack since the early 1900s. In the early years of data collection, researchers measured snow water equivalent manually, but since 1980, measurements at some locations have been collected with automated instruments as part of the snow telemetry (SNOTEL) network. The long-term analysis in Figure 1 is based on data from nearly 700 permanent measurement sites in the western United States. The snowpack analysis shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4 requires daily measurements, so it uses a smaller set of 340 SNOTEL sites that have data since 1982, which is when a large number of SNOTEL devices were deployed and came online. EPA selected 1955 as a starting point for Figure 1 because many measurement sites in the Southwest were established in the early 1950s. Natural variability in the Earth’s climate means that snowpack trends may vary slightly when measured over different time periods. For example, the period from 1945 to 1955 was unusually snowy in the Northwest, so if this indicator were to start in 1945 or 1950, the Northwest would appear to show larger decreases over time. However, the general direction of the trend is the same regardless of the start date. Analysis of the peak snowpack in Figures 2, 3, and 4 is limited to automated SNOTEL stations, which results in a shorter time period and a smaller number of stations than Figure 1. These analyses are less subject to year-to-year variation than a time series based on a single date like April 1, but snowpack conditions during the first few years (in this case, the early to mid-1980s) could still have a sizable influence on the trends calculated for this indicator. Although most parts of the West have seen reductions in snowpack―consistent with overall warming trends shown in the   indicator―snowfall trends may be partially influenced by non-climatic factors such as observation methods, land-use changes, and forest canopy changes. This indicator applies consistent methods to all locations, but each site naturally has unique local conditions and a unique distribution of data. For many of the areas where snowpack is increasing, studies have documented that despite general increases in temperature and precipitation, temperatures often remain below the freezing point, resulting in more snowfall. Data for this indicator came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service Water and Climate Center. The April 1 trend analysis for this indicator was constructed using methods consistent with Mote et al. (2005) and Mote et al.

This indicator measures the amount of land in North America that is covered by snow. This graph shows the average area covered by snow in a given calendar year, based on an analysis of weekly maps. The area is measured in square miles. These data cover all of North America (not including Greenland). Data source: Rutgers University Global Snow Lab, 2021 \n This graph shows the average area covered by snow during spring (March–May), summer (June–August), fall (September–November), and winter (December–February), based on an analysis of weekly maps. The area is measured in square miles. These data cover all of North America (not including Greenland). Data source: Rutgers University Global Snow Lab, 2011 \n This figure shows the timing of each year’s snow cover season in the contiguous 48 states and Alaska, based on an average of all parts of the country that receive snow every year. The shaded band spans from the first date of snow cover until the last date of snow cover. Data source: NOAA, 2015 \n \"Snow cover\" refers to the amount of land covered by snow at any given time. Naturally, it is influenced by the amount of precipitation that falls as snow. Air temperature also plays a role because it determines whether precipitation falls as snow or rain, and it affects the rate at which snow on the ground melts. As temperature and precipitation patterns change, so can the overall area covered by snow. Snow cover is not just something that is affected by climate change; it also exerts an influence on climate. Because snow is white, it absorbs only a small portion of the sunlight that hits it (10 to 20 percent in the case of fresh snow) and reflects the rest back to space. In contrast, darker surfaces such as bare ground and open water absorb the majority of the energy they receive and heat up more quickly. In this way, the overall amount of snow cover affects patterns of heating and cooling over the Earth’s surface. More snow means more energy reflects back to space, resulting in cooling, while less snow cover means more energy is absorbed at the Earth’s surface, resulting in warming. On a more local scale, snow cover is important for many plants and animals. For example, some plants and animals rely on a protective blanket of snow to insulate them from sub-freezing winter temperatures. Humans and ecosystems also rely on snowmelt to replenish streams and groundwater. Snow cover also keeps the soil moist, so if the snow melts away earlier in the spring, the soil may dry out sooner, which can stress plants and increase the risk of wildfire. This indicator tracks the area covered by snow since 1972, based on maps generated by analyzing satellite images collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figure 1 was created by analyzing weekly maps to determine the total extent of snow cover, then averaging the weekly observations together to get a value for each year. Figure 2 uses the same method, but with average snow cover calculated for each season: spring (defined as March–May), summer (June–August), fall (September–November), and winter (December–February). These two figures cover all of North America, not including Greenland. Figure 3 focuses on the contiguous 48 states plus Alaska. It shows the average date when snow first starts to cover the ground in the fall, the average last date of snow cover in the spring, and the length of time between them. These snow cover season dates have been averaged over all parts of the country that regularly receive snow.  Although satellite-based snow cover maps are available starting in the mid-1960s, some of the early years are missing data from several weeks during the summer, which would lead to an inaccurate annual average. Thus, the indicator is restricted to 1972 and later, with all years having a full set of data. The data for this indicator were provided by the Rutgers University Global Snow Lab, which posts data online at:  , and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service, which collects satellite measurements and compiles maps at:  ."},

This feature examines the timing of spring river ice breakup in three communities that have kept detailed records for more than 100 years. This figure shows the date each year when ice breaks up at three locations: the town of Nenana on the Tanana River, Dawson City on the Yukon River, and Bethel on the Kuskokwim River. The annual data for each river have been plotted using a nine-year moving average. Data sources: Nenana Ice Classic, 2022;  Yukon River Breakup, 2022;  Kuskokwim Ice Classic, 2022;  National Weather Service, 2022 \n Regions in the far north such as Alaska are warming more quickly than other parts of the world, and this pattern is expected to continue  (see the   indicator; for more information about regional temperature changes, see the   indicator). The Tanana, Yukon, and Kuskokwim rivers in Alaska provide a particularly noteworthy record of northern climate. For a century or more, local citizens have recorded the date when the ice on these rivers starts to move or break up each spring. In fact, some towns have annual competitions to guess when ice breakup will occur. Since 1917, the Nenana Ice Classic competition on the Tanana River in central Alaska has paid several million dollars in winnings to the people who come closest to guessing the exact date and time of day when the river ice will break up. Similar traditions exist on the Kuskokwim River in Bethel, where breakup dates have been recorded since 1924, and in Dawson City on the Yukon River, just across the border in Canada, where breakup dates have been recorded since 1896. River ice breakup is more than just a friendly competition, though. Ice breakup is an important time of transition for communities that rely on these relatively remote and free-flowing wild rivers for transportation, subsistence hunting and fishing, and other needs. In addition, early thawing can lead to severe ice movement, jamming, damage to infrastructure, and destructive floods. The data collected by these communities highlight how the river ice breakup dates in Nenana, Dawson City, and Bethel have changed over time. The towns all use the same method to measure the date and time of river ice breakup. Residents place a tripod on the ice in the center of the river. This tripod is attached by a cable to a clock on the shore. When the ice under the tripod breaks or starts to move, the tripod moves, pulling the cable and stopping the clock. For this and other examples of community connections to observed climate-related changes, see the StoryMap at:  .  Besides climate change, natural year-to-year variations and other factors, such as local development and land-use patterns, can influence ice breakup dates. The three locations featured here are relatively remote and undeveloped, so the ice breakup dates are more likely to reflect natural changes in weather and climate conditions. However, corresponding measurements of water conditions and air temperature are useful to help understand the connection between changes in river ice breakup and changes in climate. A recent comparison with satellite measurements of freeze/thaw conditions at ground level (basically a way of measuring surface temperature) showed a close correlation between regional temperature conditions and actual Tanana River breakup dates. Ice breakup dates for the Tanana River at Nenana, the Yukon River at Dawson City, and the Kuskokwim River at Bethel have been recorded and made publicly available as part of three long-running community competitions: the Nenana Ice Classic, the Yukon River Breakup, and the Kuskokwim Ice Classic.

This indicator uses two different measures to show how snowfall has changed in the contiguous 48 states. This figure shows the average rate of change in total snowfall from 1930 to 2007 at 419 weather stations in the contiguous 48 states. Blue circles represent increased snowfall; red circles represent a decrease. Data source: Kunkel et al., 2009 \n This figure shows the percentage change in winter snow-to-precipitation ratio from 1949 to 2020 at 177 weather stations in the contiguous 48 states. This ratio measures what percentage of total winter precipitation falls in the form of snow. A decrease (red circle) indicates that more precipitation is falling in the form of rain instead of snow. Solid-color circles represent stations where the trend was statistically significant. Data source: NOAA, 2021 \n Snowfall is an important aspect of winter in much of the United States. Many people depend on spring snowmelt to provide their drinking water and support other uses such as irrigation, especially in the western United States, where snowmelt provides 75 percent of the water supply.  Many communities also rely on snow for winter recreation. Some plants and animals also depend on snow and snowmelt for survival. The amount of snow that falls in a particular area directly influences both snow cover and snowpack, which refer to snow that accumulates on the ground (see the   indicator and the   indicator). Warmer temperatures cause more water to evaporate from the land and oceans, which leads to more precipitation, larger storms, and more variation in precipitation in some areas. In general, a warmer climate causes more of this precipitation to fall in the form of rain instead of snow. Some places, however, could see more snowfall if temperatures rise but still remain below the freezing point, or if storm tracks change. Areas near large lakes might also experience more snowfall as lakes remain unfrozen for longer periods, allowing more water to evaporate. In contrast, other areas might experience less snowfall as a result of wintertime droughts. Changes in the amount and timing of snowfall could affect the spawning of fish in the spring and the amount of water available for people to use in the spring and summer. Changes in snowfall could also affect winter recreation activities, like skiing, and the communities that rely on these activities. This indicator tracks total snowfall as well as the percentage of precipitation that falls in the form of snow versus rain. These data were collected from hundreds of weather stations across the contiguous 48 states. Total snowfall is determined by the height of snow that accumulates each day. These measured values commonly appear in weather reports (for example, a storm that deposits 10 inches of snow). Figure 1 shows how snowfall accumulation totals changed between 1930 and 2007 at more than 400 weather stations. These stations were selected because they had high-quality data for this entire time period. EPA continues to work on identifying an appropriate method of analysis for updating this indicator. Figure 2 shows trends in the proportion of total precipitation that falls in the form of snow during each winter season. This is called the “snow-to-precipitation” ratio, and it is based on comparing the amount of snowfall with the total amount of precipitation (snow plus rain) in each year. For this comparison, snow has been converted to the equivalent amount of liquid water. These data are available from 1949 to 2020. Several factors make it difficult to measure snowfall precisely. The snow accumulations shown in Figure 1 are based on the use of measuring rods. This measurement method is subject to human error, as well as the effects of wind (drifting snow) and the surrounding environment (such as tall trees). Similarly, snow gauges for Figure 2 may catch less snow than rain because of the effects of wind. Steps have been taken, however, to limit this indicator to weather stations with the most consistent methods and the highest-quality data.  As a result, some parts of the country have a higher station density than others. Both figures are limited to the winter season. Figure 1 comes from an analysis of October-to-May snowfall, while Figure 2 covers November through March. Although these months account for the vast majority of snowfall in most locations, this indicator might not represent the entire snow season in some areas. Most of the data shown for mountainous regions come from lower elevations (towns in valleys) because that is where weather stations tend to be located. This indicator shows trends based on two sets of weather records collected and maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figure 1 was adapted from an analysis by Kunkel et al. (2009)  based on records from Cooperative Observer Program weather stations. Figure 2 is an updated version of an analysis by Feng and Hu (2007)  using data from the Global Historical Climatology Network.

This indicator measures the area and duration of ice cover in the Great Lakes. These graphs show the percentage of surface area in each of the Great Lakes that froze on the maximum day (the “most frozen” day) of each year since 1973. The graph at the lower right is an area-weighted average of all five lakes. Data source: NOAA, 2021 \n These graphs show the number of frozen days per year in each of the Great Lakes since 1973. A frozen day is defined here as a day when at least 5 percent of the lake’s surface area was covered with ice. Data source: NOAA, 2021 \n This map shows the average annual rate of change in the duration of ice cover in the Great Lakes from 1973 to 2019. Duration is measured as the number of days in which each pixel on the map was at least 10 percent covered by ice. Gray areas are labeled “no trend” because the change over time is not statistically significant (using a 90-percent confidence level). Data source: NOAA, 2019 \n The Great Lakes—Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario—form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth. These lakes support a variety of ecosystems and play a vital role in the economy of the eight neighboring states and the Canadian province of Ontario, providing drinking water, shipping lanes, fisheries, recreational opportunities, and more. Parts of the Great Lakes typically freeze every winter. As the Earth’s climate changes, though, rising air temperatures (see the   indicator) and water temperatures (see the   indicator) have led to less ice cover on many lakes in North America, including the Great Lakes.   Ice cover is expected to decline further as the climate continues to warm. The area that freezes and the length of time that the lakes remain frozen can have a wide range of effects on people and ecosystems. As with other lakes (see the   indicator), ice cover on the Great Lakes can affect aquatic ecosystems, as well as recreational opportunities such as ice fishing. Due to the size of the Great Lakes, ice cover also plays an important role in regional weather patterns and the shipping industry. While reduced ice cover could lengthen the shipping season, it also allows more water to evaporate from the lakes, which can lead to lower water levels (see the   indicator) and restrict shipping channels.   More evaporation can also lead to an increase in precipitation over nearby land, especially “lake effect” snow (see the  indicator). This indicator presents two related ways of measuring ice cover in the Great Lakes: area (the percentage of the lake surface area that is frozen) and duration (the length of time the lakes stay frozen). Both parts of this indicator are based on daily and weekly charts and maps created by the Canadian Ice Service and the U.S. National Ice Center, which are derived from a long-running collection of observations from ships, shore, aircraft, and satellites. Complete data are available back to 1973 for each lake. Figure 1 shows the maximum portion of each lake’s surface area that was frozen in each year. Figure 2 tracks duration by showing the total number of days per year in which at least 5 percent of the lake surface was frozen. In each case, the period analyzed runs from December through May, with this entire “season” considered part of the same year. For example, “2020” represents conditions from December 2019 through May 2020. The map in Figure 3 shows how the length of time the Great Lakes stay frozen has changed over time, and how these changes vary by location. Data for this part of the indicator were available through 2019. Figure 3 only shows a rate of change for pixels where the trend is statistically significant. Temperature trends influence ice-covered area and duration, but natural year-to-year variations and decadal climate cycles may play a bigger role.   With more than four decades of data, though, this indicator clearly shows meaningful long-term trends and variations that relate to the regional climate of the Great Lakes, which is linked to broader global weather and climate patterns.

Data source: Various organizations \n This figure shows the “ice-off” date, or date of ice thawing and breakup, for 14 U.S. lakes. The data are available from as early as 1840 to 2019, depending on the lake, and have been smoothed using a nine-year moving average. Data source: Various organizations \n This figure shows the change in the “ice-off” date, or date of ice thawing and breakup, for 14 U.S. lakes during the period from 1905 to 2019. Twelve of the lakes have red circles with negative numbers, which represent earlier thaw dates. Larger circles indicate larger changes. Two of the lakes had no change in thaw dates. Data source: Various organizations \n The formation of ice cover on lakes in the winter and its disappearance the following spring depends on climate factors such as air temperature, cloud cover, and wind. Conditions such as heavy rains or snowmelt in locations upstream or elsewhere in the watershed also affect the length of time a lake is frozen. Thus, ice formation and breakup dates are key indicators of climate change. If lakes remain frozen for longer periods, it can signify that the climate is cooling. Conversely, shorter periods of ice cover suggest a warming climate. Changes in ice cover can affect the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of a body of water. For example, ice influences heat and moisture transfers between a lake and the atmosphere. Reduced lake ice cover leads to increased evaporation and lower water levels, as well as an increase in water temperature and sunlight penetration. These changes, in turn, can affect plant and animal life cycles and the availability of suitable habitat. Additionally, ice cover affects the amount of heat that is reflected from the Earth’s surface. Exposed water will absorb and retain heat, making the Earth’s surface warmer, whereas an ice- and snow-covered lake will reflect more of the sun’s energy and absorb less. (For more information on ice and snow reflecting sunlight, see the   indicator.) The timing and duration of ice cover on lakes and other bodies of water can also affect society—particularly in relation to shipping and transportation, hydroelectric power generation, and fishing. The impacts can be positive or negative. For example, reduced ice cover on a large lake could extend the open-water shipping season but require vessels to reduce their cargo capacity, as increased evaporation leads to lower water levels. This indicator analyzes the dates at which lakes freeze and thaw. Freeze dates occur when a continuous and immobile ice cover forms over a body of water. Thaw dates occur when the ice cover breaks up and open water becomes extensive. Freeze and thaw dates have been recorded through human visual observations for more than 150 years. The National Snow and Ice Data Center maintains a database with freeze and thaw observations from more than 850 lakes and rivers throughout the Northern Hemisphere. This indicator focuses on 14 lakes within the United States that have the longest and most complete historical records. The lakes of interest are located in Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, and Maine. Although there is a lengthy historical record of freeze and thaw dates for a much larger set of lakes and rivers, some records are incomplete, with breaks ranging from brief lapses to large gaps in data. This indicator is limited to 14 lakes with sufficiently complete historical records. The four Maine lakes and Lake Osakis only have data for ice thaw, so they do not appear in Figure 1 (first freeze date). Data used in this indicator are all based on visual observations. While the procedures for making observations of lake ice are consistent over time, visual observations by individuals are open to some interpretation and can differ from one individual to the next. In addition, historical observations for lakes have typically been made from a particular spot on the shore, which might not be representative of lakes as a whole or comparable to satellite-based observations. Considerations for defining the thaw date are specific to each lake. Data through 2004 for most lakes were obtained from the Global Lake and River Ice Phenology Database, which is maintained by the National Snow and Ice Data Center. These data are available at:  . More recent data were obtained from state, local, and other organizations that collected or compiled the observations. \n"},

Data source: Fagre et al., 2017;  USGS, 2017 \n This map illustrates the change in surface area of all 37 named glaciers in Glacier National Park for 1966, 1998, 2005, and 2015.

Data source: Fagre et al., 2017;  USGS, 2017 \n Visitors from far and wide are drawn to   in Montana for its dramatic beauty and its glaciers. Established in 1910, Glacier is one of the most visited national parks in the United States. Warming temperatures and other changes are melting the park’s alpine glaciers. Such changes have implications not only for tourism, but also for the ecosystems, animals, and people that depend on glacier-fed streamflow. Shrinking glaciers represent a clear and compelling indicator of climate change.  In 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) published a study where they analyzed aerial images from 1966, 1998, 2005, and 2015 to assess changes over time in the surface area of Glacier National Park’s 37 named glaciers. Scientists are studying the Park’s alpine glaciers to better understand how they have changed, what that means for the local environment, and how they may inform land management decisions in the park. Surface area changes of these glaciers do not reflect how the total mass or volume of ice may have changed. Changes in glacier surface area will not necessarily track linearly with changes in temperature because of differences in geology, shade, wind patterns that deposit snow, and other factors. The 37 glaciers included in this data set include all of Glacier National Park’s large named glaciers, but they do not represent a comprehensive accounting of all glaciers or permanent ice features in the park. These glaciers are also not necessarily representative of glaciers in other regions. In the past few decades, though, several national parks have begun to track glacier mass balance. All of these programs depend on data sets, expertise, and methodologies developed by the intensive research associated with USGS’s long-term glacier monitoring program. The data in this feature come from surface area measurements of the 37 named glaciers in Glacier National Park that have been tracked over time. This data set was originally published by USGS’s Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center. This data set is also publicly available on the USGS website at:  ."},

This indicator shows the cumulative change in the mass balance of Arctic glaciers. This figure shows the cumulative change in mass balance of a set of eight glaciers located at a latitude of 66°N or higher with data beginning in 1945. Each time series has been adjusted to make 1970 a common zero point because this was the first year for which mass balance data are available for all eight glaciers. Negative values indicate a net loss of ice and snow compared with the base year of 1970. For consistency, measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which reflects the mass loss of the glacier by representing changes in the glacier’s average thickness. Data sources: WGMS, 2021 \n Rapid changes are occurring across the Arctic, where air temperatures are warming twice as fast as the global average temperature.  The loss of land-based ice in the Arctic has accelerated in recent decades, and since at least 1972, the Arctic has been the dominant source of global sea-level rise.  Greenland is the largest contributor to global sea-level rise from Arctic land ice, followed by small glaciers. If increases in greenhouse gas concentrations continue at current rates, it is expected that many of the smallest glaciers across the Arctic would disappear entirely by mid-century.  As the   explains, glaciers are important as an indicator of climate change and provide visible evidence of changes in temperature and precipitation. Retreating glaciers and thawing permafrost in the Arctic are creating local and regional hazards that disrupt lives and livelihoods, infrastructure, sustainable development, and national security. The indicator focuses on a set of eight routinely-measured glaciers at a latitude of 66°N or higher with data back to at least 1970—in one case, 1945. Figure 1 shows the cumulative mass balance of these glaciers from 1945 to 2020. This measurement of mass balance is consistent with EPA’s  , just focusing in this case on eight routinely measured glaciers north of the Arctic Circle. “Mass balance” refers to the net gain or loss of snow and ice (accumulation versus melting, sublimation, and calving). The measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which reflects the mass loss of the glacier by representing changes in the glacier’s average thickness. Cumulative change is determined from the base year of 1970, the first year in which all eight glaciers had annual mass balance data. The relationship between climate change and glacier mass balance is complex, and the observed changes at specific reference glaciers reflect a combination of global and local variations in temperature and precipitation. Individual glaciers also vary in their structure, flow, and response to climate. Slightly different measurement and analysis methods have been used at different glaciers, but overall trends are similar. Long-term measurements are available for only a very small percentage of the world’s glaciers. This indicator does not include the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, although two decades of satellite data suggest that these ice sheets are also experiencing a net loss of ice (see the  ).  Continued satellite data collection will allow scientists to evaluate long-term trends in the future.

This indicator examines the balance between snow accumulation and melting in glaciers, and it describes how glaciers in the United States and around the world have changed over time. This figure shows the cumulative change in mass balance of a set of “reference” glaciers worldwide beginning in 1956. The line on the upper graph represents the average of all the glaciers that were measured. Negative values indicate a net loss of ice and snow compared with the base year of 1956. For consistency, measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which represent changes in the average thickness of a glacier. The small chart below shows how many glaciers were measured in each year. Some glacier measurements have not yet been finalized for the last few years, hence the smaller number of sites. Data source: WGMS, 2024 \n  This figure shows the cumulative mass balance of four U.S. reference glaciers since measurements began in the 1950s or 1960s. For each glacier, the mass balance is set at zero for the base year of 1965. Negative values indicate a net loss of ice and snow compared with the base year. For consistency, measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which represent changes in the average thickness of a glacier. Data source: USGS, 2024 \n Sources: Post, 1958;  Nolan, 2003 \n A glacier is a large mass of snow and ice that has accumulated over many years and is present year-round. In the United States, glaciers can be found in the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, the Cascades, and throughout Alaska. A glacier flows naturally like a river, only much more slowly. At higher elevations, glaciers accumulate snow, which eventually becomes compressed into ice. At lower elevations, the “river” of ice naturally loses mass because of melting and ice breaking off and floating away (iceberg calving) if the glacier ends in a lake or the ocean. When melting and calving are exactly balanced by new snow accumulation, a glacier is in equilibrium and its mass will neither increase nor decrease. In many areas, glaciers provide communities and ecosystems with a reliable source of streamflow and drinking water, particularly in times of extended drought and late in the summer, when seasonal snowpack has melted away. Freshwater runoff from glaciers also influences ocean ecosystems. Glaciers are important as an indicator of climate change because physical changes in glaciers—whether they are growing or shrinking, advancing or receding—provide visible evidence of changes in temperature and precipitation. If glaciers lose more ice than they can accumulate through new snowfall, they ultimately add more water to the oceans, leading to a rise in sea level (see the   indicator). The same kinds of changes occur on a much larger scale within the giant ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica, potentially leading to even bigger implications for sea level. Small glaciers tend to respond more quickly to climate change than the giant ice sheets. Altogether, the world’s small glaciers are adding roughly the same amount of water to the oceans per year as the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica combined. Between 1971 and 2018, they added more water overall to the oceans than the ice sheets did.   This indicator is based on long-term monitoring data collected at selected glaciers around the world. Scientists collect detailed measurements to determine glacier mass balance, which is the net gain or loss of snow and ice over the course of the year. A negative mass balance indicates that a glacier has lost ice or snow. If cumulative mass balance becomes more negative over time, it means glaciers are losing mass more quickly than they can accumulate new snow. Figure 1 shows trends in mass balance for a set of 61 reference glaciers around the world that have been measured consistently since the 1970s, including several that have been measured since the 1950s. Data from these reference glaciers have been averaged together to depict changes over time. Figure 2 shows trends for four of these reference glaciers that are located in the United States. South Cascade Glacier in Washington state, Lemon Creek Glacier in southeastern Alaska, Wolverine Glacier near Alaska’s southern coast, and Gulkana Glacier in Alaska’s interior are all part of the U.S. Geological Survey’s longstanding “benchmark” glacier program. These four glaciers were chosen because they have been studied extensively for many years and because they are thought to be representative of other glaciers nearby. This indicator describes the change in glacier mass balance, which is measured as the average change in thickness across the surface of a glacier. The change in ice or snow has been converted to the equivalent amount of liquid water. The relationship between climate change and glacier mass balance is complex, and the observed changes at specific reference or benchmark glaciers might reflect a combination of global and local variations in temperature and precipitation. Individual glaciers also vary in their structure, flow, and response to climate. Slightly different measurement and analysis methods have been used at different glaciers, but overall trends appear to be similar. Long-term measurements are available for only a relatively small percentage of the world’s glaciers. This indicator does not include the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, although EPA’s   indicator shows that they are also experiencing a net loss of ice. The World Glacier Monitoring Service compiled data for Figure 1, based on measurements collected by a variety of organizations around the world. The U.S. Geological Survey Benchmark Glacier Program provided the data for the four glaciers in Figure 2.

This indicator examines the balance between snow accumulation and melting in the ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica. This figure shows the cumulative change in mass in the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica since 1992. The dark “combined” lines are based on more than 20 different studies that have been combined for each region. Shading shows the uncertainty estimates from the various data sets that feed into the combined average. The two “NASA JPL” lines have been added to show results from one commonly cited analysis, including seasonal variations. All estimates are centered at zero in 2002 to provide a consistent point of reference. Thus, a downward slope indicates a net loss of ice and snow. For reference, 1,000 billion metric tons is equal to about 260 cubic miles of ice—enough to raise sea level by about 3 millimeters. Data sources: Otosaka et al., 2023;  NASA, 2024 \n Ice sheets are large bodies of ice on land that cover hundreds of thousands of square miles on Greenland and Antarctica. Greenland’s ice sheet reaches more than 1 mile thick on average in the interior and contains an estimated 700,000 cubic miles of ice, while Antarctica’s ice is nearly 3 miles thick in some places, with a volume of about 7 million cubic miles.  Together, these ice sheets hold nearly 70 percent of the world’s fresh water. Some of this ice has been in place for more than 1 million years. Ice sheets accumulate snowfall—just like small glaciers (see the   indicator) but at a larger scale. Over time, this snow becomes compacted into layers of ice, and the weight of this ice causes it to flow downhill and outward toward the ocean. When an ice sheet is in equilibrium, new snow accumulation is balanced by melting at the surface, runoff, and calving (ice breaking off to form icebergs) at the ocean. A warmer climate affects ice sheets in several ways. The most evident impact observed to date is a loss of ice due to warmer air and ocean waters. Warmer air causes the ice to melt more quickly and flow more rapidly to the sea, especially in low-elevation regions near the edges of the ice sheets. Warmer ocean waters melt the edge and base of the ice sheet and accelerate the process of calving. In addition, warmer ocean waters weaken the floating ice shelves that form in key places along the coast, especially in Antarctica. These ice shelves help to hold back the flow of ice on land, so as ice shelves shrink or disappear, ice from the ice sheet can flow into the ocean more quickly. Some of the losses are offset, because warmer air allows very cold interior regions in Greenland and Antarctica to receive more snowfall. Overall, though, both ice sheets are experiencing a net loss of ice. Ultimately, as the ice sheets shrink, the water they add to the ocean raises sea level around the world (see the   indicator). Melting of Greenland and Antarctica’s ice sheets accounted for about one-third of observed global sea level rise between 2006 and 2015.  Thus, ice sheets are important indicators not only because of their sensitivity to changes in climate, but also for their role in global sea level rise. Because Greenland and Antarctica are so large and remote, satellite instruments offer the most effective way to measure changes in their ice sheets. Scientists have used three main measurement techniques to do this: Estimates of the exact rate of ice gain or loss in Greenland and Antarctica vary depending on the measurement technique and the methods used to process the data. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, to get a more complete picture, scientists have combined many different estimates from a variety of organizations. This indicator offers a combined estimate from an international program called the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE). IMBIE is supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA). The IMBIE team combined 27 peer-reviewed estimates of ice sheet mass balance for Greenland and 23 for Antarctica, going back as far as 1992 and representing all three major techniques. Figure 1 represents the results from their combined averages. Figure 1 also shows estimates from a specific analysis of GRACE data by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). These data are shown for reference and comparison because NASA JPL is a widely cited, influential source, and because the results show seasonal patterns. The relationship between climate change and ice sheet mass balance is complex, particularly in Antarctica, where large areas will continue to be too cold to experience appreciable surface melting, some areas may experience more snowfall that offsets the other effects of warming, and rates of ice loss can be heavily influenced by specific “tipping point” events such as the collapse of an ice shelf. Scientists who study Antarctica’s ice sheets often divide the continent into three main regions—East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula—because each of these regions has distinct geological characteristics and weather patterns that influence their vulnerability to climate change. Data are not available prior to 1992 for these two featured data sets. However, studies using other methods provide a longer historical perspective.  Unlike smaller land ice features such as glaciers (see the   indicator), the vast ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica do not have enough widespread, repeated measurements collected onsite to permit reliable estimates of changes in overall mass balance. This indicator presents results from multiple measurement methodologies for comparison and to expand the temporal coverage of the time series for ice sheet mass balance of Greenland and Antarctica. The NASA time series each have a gap from mid-2017 to mid-2018, reflecting the gap between the original GRACE satellite mission and the GRACE Follow On satellites that launched in 2018.

This indicator tracks the extent of sea ice around Antarctica. This figure shows Antarctic sea ice extent for the months of February and September of each year from 1979 through 2021. The minimum and maximum sea ice extent typically occur in February and September each year. Data source: NSIDC, 2022 \n These maps from 2021 provide an example of how Antarctic sea ice coverage typically varies between the annual minimum and maximum. Source: NASA, 2022 \n The Southern Ocean around Antarctica freezes to form sea ice every year. This sea ice typically reaches its maximum extent in September or early October, around the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. At that point, virtually the entire continent of Antarctica is surrounded by a ring of sea ice (see images below). The ice melts in the summer months (December to February) because of warmer temperatures and long hours of sunlight. Unlike the Arctic, where a large area of sea ice lasts year-round (see the   indicator), the sea ice around Antarctica is thinner and nearly all of it melts in a typical summer. This happens because no landmass is present to stop Antarctic sea ice from breaking up and drifting northward into warmer waters, where it eventually melts. Like Arctic sea ice, Antarctic sea ice affects global climate, regional climate, and ecosystems. Because ice is more reflective than liquid water, it plays a significant role in maintaining the Earth’s energy balance and helping to keep polar regions cool. (For more information on how the color of the Earth's surface affects the absorption of sunlight, see the   indicator.) Sea ice also keeps the air cool by forming a barrier between the cold air above and the warmer water below. Antarctic sea ice is an important part of the habitat for penguins, seals, and other animals. Warmer air and ocean temperatures are generally expected to reduce the amount of sea ice present worldwide. While warming has already driven a noticeable decline in sea ice in the Arctic, extent in the Antarctic as a whole has not yet declined, which may reflect influences of wind patterns, ocean currents, and precipitation around the continent. Figure 1 shows Antarctic sea ice extent from 1979, when routine monitoring by satellites started, to 2021. Sea ice extent is defined as the area of ocean where at least 15 percent of the surface is frozen. This threshold was chosen because scientists have found that it gives the best approximation of the edge of the ice. Data are collected throughout the year, but for comparison, this indicator focuses on the months when sea ice typically reaches its minimum and maximum extent. February is typically when the sea ice extent reaches its annual minimum after melting during the spring and summer. The ice typically reaches its maximum extent in late September or early October after winter freezing, with the largest monthly average extent occurring in September. However, in 2021, maximum extent occurred in August. Data for this indicator were gathered by the National Snow and Ice Data Center using satellite imaging technology and data processing methods developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Unlike EPA’s Arctic Sea Ice indicator, this indicator does not show the age of Antarctic sea ice. This is because nearly all of the Antarctic ice melts every summer, unlike the Arctic, where a large portion of ice survives for multiple years. Compared with the noticeable decrease in Arctic sea ice extent (see the   indicator), the increase in Antarctic sea ice is small. Many factors appear to be influencing Antarctic sea ice extent, including changes in wind patterns and fresh water entering the ocean from melting ice sheets.  For instance, a 2016 study showed that changes to atmospheric circulation patterns in the Antarctic region are responsible for recent increases in sea ice extent.  Without better ice thickness and ice volume estimates, it is difficult to characterize how the total amount of Antarctic sea ice is responding to climate change. The data for this indicator were provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, which produces a variety of reports analyzing sea ice. These data are also available online at:  ."},

This indicator tracks the extent, age, and melt season of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. This figure shows Arctic sea ice extent for the months of September and March of each year from 1979 through 2023. September and March are when the minimum and maximum extent typically occur each year. Data source: NSIDC, 2023 \n November 2023 This figure shows the distribution of Arctic sea ice extent by age group during the week in September with the smallest extent of ice for each year. The total extent in Figure 2 differs from the extent in Figure 1 because Figure 1 shows a monthly average, while Figure 2 shows conditions during a single week. Data source: NSIDC, 2023 \n This figure shows the timing of each year’s Arctic sea ice melt season. The shaded band spans from the date when ice begins to melt consistently until the date when it begins to refreeze. Data source: NASA, 2023 \n November  Source: NASA, 2023 \n Sea ice, which is sea water that freezes from the ocean surface down to several feet below, is an integral part of the Arctic Ocean. During the dark winter months, sea ice essentially covers the entire Arctic Ocean. In summer, some of this ice melts because of warmer temperatures and long hours of sunlight. Sea ice typically reaches its minimum thickness and extent in mid-September, when the area covered by ice is roughly half the size of the winter maximum. The ice then begins to expand again during fall and winter when temperatures decrease and sunlight is limited. The extent of area covered by Arctic sea ice is an important indicator of changes in global climate because warmer air and water temperatures are reducing the amount of sea ice present. Because sea ice is light-colored, it reflects more sunlight (solar energy) back to space than liquid water, thereby playing an important role in maintaining the Earth’s energy balance and helping to keep polar regions cool. (For more information on the effects of surface color on reflecting sunlight, see the   indicator.) Sea ice also keeps the air cool by forming a barrier between the cold air above and the relatively warmer water below. As the amount of sea ice decreases due to the oceans absorbing more solar energy, the cooling effect of this ice is reduced, which can magnify the original warming. The magnified warming then leads to even more loss of sea ice. The age of sea ice is also an important indicator of Arctic conditions, because ice that has accumulated over many years is generally thicker and stronger than younger ice. A loss of older ice suggests that the Arctic ice cover is becoming thinner. Evidence also suggests that the melt season has become longer; the ice is starting to melt earlier in the year and freeze later than it used to. Changes in sea ice can directly affect the health of Arctic ecosystems. Mammals such as polar bears and walruses rely on the presence of sea ice for hunting, breeding, and migrating. These animals face the threat of declining birth rates and restricted access to food sources because of reduced sea ice coverage and thickness. Impacts on Arctic wildlife, as well as the loss of ice itself, are already restricting the traditional subsistence hunting lifestyle of indigenous Arctic populations such as the Yup’ik, Iñupiat, and Inuit. While diminished sea ice can have negative ecological effects, it can also present commercial and economic opportunities. For instance, reduced sea ice opens shipping lanes and increases access to natural resources in the Arctic region. Figure 1 shows Arctic sea ice extent from 1979, when routine monitoring by satellites started, to 2023. Sea ice extent is defined as the area of ocean where at least 15 percent of the surface is frozen. This threshold was chosen because scientists have found that it gives the best approximation of the edge of the ice. While data are collected throughout the year, this indicator focuses on the months when sea ice typically reaches its minimum and maximum extent. September is typically when the sea ice extent reaches its annual minimum after melting during the spring and summer. Conversely, March is typically when sea ice reaches its maximum extent after winter freezing. Data for this indicator were gathered by the National Snow and Ice Data Center using satellite imaging technology and data processing methods developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Figure 2 examines the age of the ice that is present in the Arctic during the one week in September that has the smallest extent of ice. By combining daily satellite images, wind measurements, and data from surface buoys that move with the ice, scientists can track specific parcels of ice as they move over time. This tracking enables them to calculate the age of the ice in different parts of the Arctic. Although satellites started collecting data in 1979, Figure 2 only shows data back to 1984 because it is not possible to know the full age distribution until the ice has been tracked for at least five years. Figure 3 shows the start and end dates of each year’s Arctic sea ice melt season, starting in 1979. It is based on the same satellite instruments as Figure 1.  Increasing air and ocean temperatures associated with climate change are not the only factors contributing to reductions in sea ice. Other conditions that may be affected by climate change, such as fluctuations in oceanic and atmospheric circulation and natural annual and decadal variability, also affect the extent of sea ice. Determining the age of ice is an imperfect science, as there are cases where a small amount of older ice might exist within an area classified as younger, or vice versa.

The Earth’s surface contains many forms of snow and ice, including sea, lake, and river ice; snow cover; glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets; and frozen ground. Climate change can dramatically alter the Earth’s snow- and ice-covered areas because snow and ice can easily change between solid and liquid states in response to relatively minor changes in temperature. This chapter focuses on trends in snow, glaciers, and the freezing and thawing of oceans and lakes. Reduced snowfall and less snow cover on the ground could diminish the beneficial insulating effects of snow for vegetation and wildlife, while also affecting water supplies, transportation, cultural practices, travel, and recreation for millions of people. For communities in Arctic regions, reduced sea ice could increase coastal erosion and exposure to storms, threatening homes and property, while thawing ground could damage roads and buildings and accelerate erosion. Conversely, reduced snow and ice could present commercial opportunities for others, including ice-free shipping lanes and increased access to natural resources. Such changing climate conditions can have worldwide implications because snow and ice influence air temperatures, sea level, ocean currents, and storm patterns. For example, melting ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica add fresh water to the ocean, increasing sea level and possibly changing ocean circulation that is driven by differences in temperature and salinity. Because of their light color, snow and ice also reflect more sunlight than open water or bare ground, so a reduction in snow cover and ice causes the Earth’s surface to absorb more energy from the sun and become warmer."},

This indicator describes changes in the chemistry of the ocean that relate to the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the water. This figure shows the relationship between changes in ocean carbon dioxide levels (measured in the left column as a partial pressure—a common way of measuring the amount of a gas) and acidity (measured as pH in the right column). The data come from two observation stations in the North Atlantic Ocean (Bermuda and Canary Islands), one in the Caribbean Sea (Cariaco), and one in the Pacific (Hawaii). The up-and-down pattern shows the influence of seasonal variations. Data sources: Bates, 2016;  González-Dávila, 2012;  University of South Florida, 2021;  University of Hawaii, 2023 \n This map shows changes in the aragonite saturation level of ocean surface waters between the 1880s and the most recent decade (2006–2015). Aragonite is a form of calcium carbonate that many marine animals use to build their skeletons and shells. The lower the saturation level, the more difficult it is for organisms to build and maintain their skeletons and shells. A negative change represents a decrease in saturation. Data source: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, 2016 \n Acidity is commonly measured using the pH scale. Pure water has a pH of about 7, which is considered neutral. A substance with a pH less than 7 is considered to be acidic, while a substance with a pH greater than 7 is considered to be basic or alkaline. The lower the pH, the more acidic the substance. Like the well-known Richter scale for measuring earthquakes, the pH scale is based on powers of 10, which means a substance with a pH of 3 is 10 times more acidic than a substance with a pH of 4. For more information about pH, visit:  . Image recreated from: Environment Canada, 2008,  with additional data from IPCC, 2014 \n The ocean plays an important role in regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide rise (see the   indicator), the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide. Because of the slow mixing time between surface waters and deeper waters, it can take hundreds to thousands of years to establish this balance. From 1750 to 2019, oceans absorbed about 25 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere by human activities, according to data in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (total human emissions of 685 ± 75 PgC and ocean uptake of 170 ± 20 PgC). Although the ocean’s ability to take up carbon dioxide prevents atmospheric levels from climbing even higher, rising levels of carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean can have a negative effect on some marine life. Carbon dioxide reacts with sea water to produce carbonic acid. The resulting increase in acidity (measured by lower pH values) changes the balance of minerals in the water. This makes it more difficult for corals, some types of plankton, and other creatures to produce a mineral called calcium carbonate, which is the main ingredient in their hard skeletons or shells. Thus, declining pH can make it more difficult for these animals to thrive. This can lead to broader changes in the overall structure of ocean and coastal ecosystems, and can ultimately affect fish and shellfish populations and the people, communities, or Tribes who depend on them for jobs or subsistence. While changes in ocean pH and mineral saturation caused by the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide generally occur over many decades, these properties can fluctuate over shorter periods, especially in coastal and surface waters. For example, increased photosynthesis during the day and during the summer leads to natural fluctuations in pH. Acidity also varies with water temperature. This indicator describes trends in pH and related properties of ocean water, based on a combination of direct observations, calculations, and modeling. Figure 1 shows pH values and levels of dissolved carbon dioxide at four locations that have collected measurements consistently over the last few decades. These data have been either measured directly or calculated from related measurements, such as dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity. Data come from two stations in the Atlantic Ocean (Bermuda and the Canary Islands), one in the Caribbean Sea (Cariaco Basin), and one in the Pacific (Hawaii). The global map in Figure 2 shows changes over time in aragonite saturation level. Aragonite is a specific form of calcium carbonate that many organisms produce and use to build their skeletons and shells, and the saturation state is a measure of how easily aragonite can dissolve in the water. The lower the saturation level, the more difficult it is for organisms to build and maintain their protective skeletons and shells. This map was created by comparing average conditions during the 1880s with average conditions during the most recent 10 years of available data (2006–2015). Aragonite saturation has only been measured at selected locations during the last few decades, but it can be calculated reliably for different times and locations based on the relationships scientists have observed among aragonite saturation, pH, dissolved carbon, water temperature, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and other factors that can be measured. Thus, while Figure 2 was created using a computer model, it is based on measurements. This indicator focuses on surface waters, which can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere within a few months.  It can take much longer for changes in pH and mineral saturation to spread to deeper waters, so the full effect of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on ocean acidity may not be seen for many decades, if not centuries. Studies suggest that the impacts of ocean acidification may be greater at depth, because the aragonite saturation level is naturally lower in deeper waters. Ocean chemistry is not uniform around the world, so local conditions can cause pH or aragonite saturation measurements to differ from the global average. For example, carbon dioxide dissolves more readily in cold water than in warm water, so colder regions could experience greater impacts from acidity than warmer regions. Air and water pollution also lead to increased acidity in some areas. Data for Figure 1 came from four studies: the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study, the European Station for Time-Series in the Ocean (Canary Islands), the Carbon Retention in a Colored Ocean (CARIACO) program (Cariaco Basin), and the Hawaii Ocean Time-Series.

This indicator describes how sea level has changed over time. The indicator describes two types of sea level changes: absolute and relative. This graph shows cumulative changes in sea level for the world’s oceans since 1880, based on a combination of long-term tide gauge measurements and recent satellite measurements. This figure shows average absolute sea level change, which refers to the height of the ocean surface, regardless of whether nearby land is rising or falling. Satellite data are based solely on measured sea level, while the long-term tide gauge data include a small correction factor because the size and shape of the oceans are changing slowly over time. (On average, the ocean floor has been gradually sinking since the last Ice Age peak, 20,000 years ago.) The shaded band shows the likely range of values, based on the number of measurements collected and the precision of the methods used. Data sources: CSIRO, 2017;  NOAA, 2024 \n This map shows cumulative changes in relative sea level from 1960 to 2023 at tide gauge stations along U.S. coasts. Relative sea level reflects changes in sea level as well as land elevation. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n As the temperature of the Earth changes, so does sea level. Temperature and sea level are linked for two main reasons: Changing sea levels can affect human activities in coastal areas. Rising sea level inundates low-lying wetlands and dry land, erodes shorelines, contributes to coastal flooding, and increases the flow of salt water into estuaries and nearby groundwater aquifers. Higher sea level also makes coastal infrastructure more vulnerable to damage from storms. The sea level changes that affect coastal systems involve more than just expanding oceans, however, because the Earth’s continents can also rise and fall relative to the oceans. Land can rise through processes such as sediment accumulation (the process that built the Mississippi River delta) and geological uplift (for example, as glaciers melt and the land below is no longer weighed down by heavy ice). In other areas, land can sink because of erosion, sediment compaction, natural subsidence (sinking due to geologic changes), groundwater withdrawal, or engineering projects that prevent rivers from naturally depositing sediments along their banks. Changes in ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream can also affect sea levels by pushing more water against some coastlines and pulling it away from others, raising or lowering sea levels accordingly. Scientists account for these types of changes by measuring sea level change in two different ways.   sea level change refers to how the height of the ocean rises or falls relative to the land at a particular location. In contrast,   sea level change refers to the height of the ocean surface above the center of the earth, without regard to whether nearby land is rising or falling. Evidence suggests sea level along the U.S. coastline will rise 10 to 12 inches by 2050—as much as the rise measured from 1920 to 2020.  (The 10 to 12 inches are an average: differences in both land and ocean height mean the rise will vary regionally along U.S. coasts.) This indicator presents trends in sea level based on measurements from tide gauges and from satellites that orbit the Earth. Tide gauges measure relative sea level change at points along the coast, while satellite instruments measure absolute sea level change over nearly the entire ocean surface. Many tide gauges have collected data for more than 100 years, while satellites have collected data since the early 1990s. Figure 1 shows annual absolute sea level change averaged over the entire Earth’s ocean surface. The long-term trend is based on tide gauge data that have been adjusted to show absolute global trends through calibration with recent satellite data. This long-term data set has been calculated through 2013, while satellite data are now available through the end of 2023. Figure 2 shows trends at a more local scale, highlighting the 1960 to 2023 change in relative sea level at 72 tide gauges along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts of the United States. Relative sea level trends represent a combination of absolute sea level change and any local land movement. Tide gauge measurements such as those in Figure 2 generally cannot distinguish between these two different influences without an accurate measurement of vertical land motion nearby. Some changes in relative and absolute sea level can be due to multi-year cycles such as El Niño and La Niña, which affect coastal ocean temperatures, salt content, wind patterns, atmospheric pressure (and thus storm tracks), and currents. Obtaining a reliable trend can require many years of data, which is why the satellite record in Figure 1 has been supplemented with a longer-term reconstruction based on tide gauge measurements. Absolute sea level trends were provided by Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These data are based on measurements collected by satellites and tide gauges. Relative sea level data are available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which publishes an interactive online map ( ) with links to detailed data for each tide gauge."},

This feature provides a closer look at one consequence of sea level rise along the Atlantic coast: the conversion of land to open water. This graph shows the net amount of land converted to open water along the Atlantic coast during three time periods: 1996–2001, 1996–2006, and 1996–2011. The results are divided into two regions: the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic (see locator map). Negative numbers show where land loss is outpaced by the accumulation of new land. Data source: NOAA, 2013 \n This graph shows the net amount of land converted to open water along the Atlantic coast during three time periods: 1996–2001, 1996–2006, and 1996–2011. The results are divided into categories to show the type of land that has been converted to open water. Data source: NOAA, 2013 \n Much of the land along the Atlantic coast is flat and close to sea level—including thousands of square miles of marshes and other productive wetlands, plus many low-lying cities. In addition, much of the land along the Atlantic coast is sinking, which magnifies the local effect of sea level rise. The land in North America is actually still adjusting to the loss of ice after the last ice age, which peaked about 20,000 years ago. Back then, thick sheets of ice covered areas of what is now Canada and the northern United States. The weight of all that ice depressed the land beneath it, but caused the land farther south (particularly the Mid-Atlantic region from North Carolina to New York) to bulge upward. After the ice melted and the extra weight was lifted, northern areas began to rise, and the Mid-Atlantic region started to sink. This very slow process continues today. Rising sea level tends to make headlines during extreme events, like the storm surge that caused billions of dollars in damage during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Yet rising sea level can also cause permanent changes in the landscape when it inundates (submerges) low-lying land. The Atlantic coast is particularly vulnerable because of low elevations and sinking shorelines. The loss of coastal land can affect a large number of people, as nearly 10 million Americans live in a coastal floodplain.  Coastal ecosystems are also at risk. These environments provide habitat for many kinds of plants and animals, as well as services that ensure people’s well-being, ranging from food production to recreation. Coastal wetlands provide valuable nursery, feeding, breeding, staging, and resting areas for many fish, shellfish, mammals, and birds, and they can buffer coastal areas against storm and wave damage. As sea level rises, dry land can turn into wetland or open water. Existing wetlands can be threatened, too, as salt marshes, mangrove forests, and other coastal wetlands are at risk of being converted to open water. The   indicator shows that sea level is rising overall in connection with climate change, but the rate of change varies by region, as do the effects. To provide a useful regional perspective, this feature examines the amount of land lost to sea level rise along the Atlantic coast from Florida to New York. It is based on satellite data that have been collected and analyzed at five-year intervals since 1996. Figure 1 divides the Atlantic coast into two regions for comparison, while Figure 2 shows the different types of land that have been lost. Measurements of the change in coastal land depend on land cover and elevation data, which have significant limits in terms of accuracy and precision. Some results are field-checked for accuracy. The coastal land cover data are routinely compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coastal Change Analysis Program, and they represent the federal government’s most comprehensive set of data on land use and land cover in the coastal zone. Sea level rise is not the only factor that contributes to the loss of coastal land. In addition to the natural sinking of the shoreline in some areas, such as the Mid-Atlantic, coastal land loss has been made worse by human activities such as navigation and flood control structures that block wetland migration or the movement of sediment; withdrawal of ground water, oil, or natural gas in some regions; and boat traffic that accelerates wetland erosion.  Natural processes unrelated to current sea level rise can also cause shores to erode. This feature is based on land cover data from the Coastal Change Analysis Program, which is coordinated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

This indicator tracks the occurrence of unusually high temperatures in U.S. coastal waters. This map shows the change in annual cumulative intensity of marine heat waves along U.S. coasts from 1982 to 2023. Cumulative intensity is measured in degree days—marine heat wave intensity multiplied by duration. Areas with increases are shown in red, with darker colors indicating greater change. The map shows total change, which is the annual rate of change (trend slope) multiplied by the number of years analyzed. The boundaries include the area within the U.S. exclusive economic zone. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n This set of maps shows the change in cumulative intensity of marine heat waves along U.S. coasts from 1982 to 2023 by season. The calculation approach and geographic area are the same as in Figure 1. Seasons are defined as follows: December, January, and February for winter; March, April, and May for spring; June, July, and August for summer; and September, October, and November for fall. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n These graphs show the percentage of each coastal region’s area that experienced at least one marine heat wave in a given year. The stacked segments show severity levels (see definitions in the technical documentation) for the most severe heat wave at a location, while the total height of the stack represents the total area that experienced a marine heat wave of any severity. For example, in 2023, 100 percent of the Northeast region experienced at least one heat wave of moderate severity or higher, while 35 percent of the region’s area experienced at least one severe heat wave and 8 percent experienced an extreme heat wave. Data are broken into six regions whose boundaries include the area within the U.S. exclusive economic zone. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n These graphs show a timeline of marine heat wave events for five marine protected areas selected from different parts of the U.S. coastline. The columns in each graph show each individual event’s duration (width of the column), intensity (height), and severity level (color; see definitions in the technical documentation). The distribution of vertical columns reflects the frequency of heat waves. The small map to the right shows the areas analyzed (blue). Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n Temperature is an important physical characteristic of ocean water. As the   indicator explains, the range of temperature conditions plays an important role in determining what species of plants, animals, and microbes can survive or thrive in a particular area. Long-term changes in these temperature ranges can affect ecological communities by shifting species’ geographic distribution (see the   indicator), influencing migration and breeding patterns, and ultimately altering habitat and the movement of nutrients. Short-term spikes in temperature also pose a concern. Just like heat waves based on air temperature (see the   indicator), marine heat waves are an extreme condition that can severely disrupt marine life. This disruption can cause harm as ocean creatures—particularly those that are stationary, like corals—are not able to escape waters that become too warm to tolerate for an extended period. Marine heat waves are associated with some of the largest disruptions to marine life in recent years. For example, persistent marine heat wave conditions in the northern Pacific have fed harmful algal blooms that then led to closures in the Dungeness crab fishery and deaths of sea lions.   Daily, weekly, and seasonal variation in sea surface temperature is natural. Ocean temperatures can also vary year to year, due to multi-year cycles such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. As ocean waters become warmer overall, though, marine heat waves will become more common and more extreme. This indicator reports on observed trends in the occurrence and intensity of marine heat waves along U.S. coasts over the past four decades, based on daily sea surface temperature measurements. Sea surface temperature records come from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and are based on satellite measurements of water temperature, with additional data from buoys and ships providing confirmation and helping to fill occasional gaps in measurement coverage. The indicator starts in 1982, which was the first full year with available satellite data. For this indicator, a marine heat wave is a period of at least five days in a row in which the sea surface temperature at a given location is hotter than at least 90 percent of past observations at that location on that particular day of the year. For example, this means the temperature on August 15 at a particular location is compared with August 15 temperatures from many prior years at that location. Thus, a marine heat wave can occur at any time of year—even in winter—if the temperature is much warmer than usual. The indicator uses a 30-year historical reference period of 1982–2011 to establish these thresholds. Each marine heat wave event can be characterized by its duration (length in days) and its intensity (the number of degrees by which the temperature exceeded the 90 percent threshold). Figure 1 combines the duration, intensity, and frequency of marine heat waves into a single metric called cumulative intensity, measured in degree-days. For example, an event lasting 10 days with an intensity of 5 degrees in each day would have a cumulative intensity of 50 degree-days. This indicator adds degree-days for all events to get an annual total. If a location experiences an increase in annual cumulative intensity over time, that means marine heat waves are becoming either more common, longer, more intense, or some combination of the three. Figure 1 shows the long-term change in annual cumulative intensity at locations within the U.S. exclusive economic zone, which generally extends up to 200 nautical miles from the coast. Figure 2 follows the same approach but presents trends by season, as certain seasons are important times of year for food source availability and life cycle events like spawning and migration. Figure 3 provides a more detailed look at marine heat waves by coastal region, showing the portion of each region’s area affected by marine heat waves in each year, and the strength of each year’s most severe marine heat wave. Figure 4 provides a detailed timeline of marine heat wave events showing the duration, intensity, and level of severity of each event, focusing on five specific locations as case studies. The five locations are designated marine protected areas, which are areas with particular importance for protecting marine species populations. Examples have been selected from each of the different coastal regions. Sea surface temperature varies seasonally, but a marine heat wave can happen at any time of year if the water temperature is much higher than normal. Temperatures can also vary as a result of year-to-year climate patterns, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.  The five areas selected for Figure 4 are not meant to be representative of conditions along the entire coastline, but they can be thought of as case studies that more closely illustrate location-specific marine heat wave conditions in ecologically sensitive and protected areas. This indicator is based on daily sea surface temperature data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information.

This graph uses the 1971 to 2000 average as a baseline for depicting change. Choosing a different baseline period would not change the shape of the data over time. The shaded band shows the range of uncertainty in the data, based on the number of measurements collected and the precision of the methods used. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n This map shows how average sea surface temperature around the world changed between 1901 and 2022. It is based on a combination of direct measurements and satellite measurements. A black “+” symbol in the middle of a square on the map means the trend shown is statistically significant. White areas did not have enough data to calculate reliable long-term trends. Data source: NOAA, 2023 \n Sea surface temperature—the temperature of the water at the ocean surface—is an important physical attribute of the world’s oceans. The surface temperature of the world’s oceans varies mainly with latitude, with the warmest waters generally near the equator and the coldest waters in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. As the oceans absorb more heat, sea surface temperature increases, and the ocean circulation patterns that transport warm and cold water around the globe change. Changes in sea surface temperature can alter marine ecosystems in several ways. For example, variations in ocean temperature can affect what species of plants, animals, and microbes are present in a location, alter migration and breeding patterns, threaten sensitive ocean life such as corals, and change the frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms such as “red tide.”  Over the long term, increases in sea surface temperature could also reduce the circulation patterns that bring nutrients from the deep sea to surface waters. Changes in reef habitat and nutrient supply could dramatically alter ocean ecosystems and lead to declines in fish populations, which in turn could affect people who depend on fishing for food or jobs.  Many coastal areas have a large share of people who depend on income from fishing, tourism, or both. This is especially common in areas that have fewer economic alternatives, including rural counties and the United States’ Caribbean and Pacific island commonwealths and territories. Because the oceans continuously interact with the atmosphere, sea surface temperature can also have profound effects on global climate. Increases in sea surface temperature have led to an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor over the oceans.  This water vapor feeds weather systems that produce precipitation, increasing the risk of heavy rain and snow (see the   and   indicators). Changes in sea surface temperature can shift storm tracks, potentially contributing to droughts in some areas.  Increases in sea surface temperature are also expected to lengthen the growth season for certain bacteria that can contaminate seafood and cause foodborne illnesses, thereby increasing the risk of health effects. This indicator tracks average global sea surface temperature from 1880 through 2023. It also includes a map to show how change in sea surface temperature has varied across the world’s oceans from 1901 to 2022. Techniques for measuring sea surface temperature have evolved since the 1800s. For instance, the earliest data were collected by inserting a thermometer into a water sample collected by lowering a bucket from a ship. Today, temperature measurements are collected more systematically from ships, as well as at stationary and drifting buoys. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has carefully reconstructed and filtered the data in Figure 1 to correct for biases in the different collection techniques and to minimize the effects of sampling changes over various locations and times. The data are shown as anomalies, or differences, compared with the average sea surface temperature from 1971 to 2000. The map in Figure 2 was originally developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which calculated long-term trends based on a collection of published studies. Both components of this indicator are based on instrumental measurements of surface water temperature. Due to denser sampling and improvements in sampling design and measurement techniques, newer data are more precise than older data. The earlier trends shown by this indicator have less certainty because of lower sampling frequency and less precise sampling methods. Data for Figure 1 were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information and are available online at:  . These data were reconstructed from measurements of water temperature, which are available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at:  . Figure 2 is an updated version of a map that appeared in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report ( ), which gathered data from a variety of studies that provide the best available information about climate change."},

Data sources: IAP, 2024;  MRI/JMA, 2024;  NOAA, 2024 \n When sunlight and energy trapped by greenhouse gases reach the Earth’s surface, the world’s oceans absorb some of this energy and store it as heat. This heat is initially absorbed at the surface, but some of it eventually spreads to deeper waters. Currents also move this heat around the world. Water has a much higher heat capacity than air, meaning the oceans can absorb larger amounts of heat energy with only a slight increase in temperature. The total amount of heat stored by the oceans is called “ocean heat content,” and measurements of water temperature reflect the amount of heat in the water at a particular time and location. Ocean temperature plays an important role in the Earth’s climate system—particularly sea surface temperature (see the   indicator)—because heat from ocean surface waters provides energy for storms and thereby influences weather patterns. Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are trapping more energy from the sun. Because changes in ocean systems occur over centuries, the oceans have not yet warmed as much as the atmosphere, even though they have absorbed more than 90 percent of the Earth’s extra heat over the last half-century,  and even as the rate of ocean heat uptake has doubled since 1993.  If not for the large heat-storage capacity provided by the oceans, the atmosphere would warm more rapidly.  Increased heat absorption also changes ocean currents because many currents are driven by differences in temperature, which cause differences in density. These currents influence climate patterns and sustain ecosystems that depend on certain temperature ranges. Because water expands slightly as it gets warmer, an increase in ocean heat content will also increase the volume of water in the ocean, which is one of the major causes of the observed increases in sea level (see the   indicator). For all these reasons, ocean heat content is one of the most important indicators tracking the causes and responses of a changing climate. This indicator shows trends in global ocean heat content from 1955 to 2023. Measurement data are available for the top 2,000 meters (nearly 6,600 feet) of the ocean, which accounts for nearly half of the total volume of water in the world’s oceans. This indicator also shows changes representative of the top 700 meters (nearly 2,300 feet) of the world’s oceans, where much of the observed warming has taken place. The indicator measures ocean heat content in joules, which are units of energy. Organizations around the world have calculated changes in ocean heat content based on measurements of ocean temperatures at different depths. These measurements come from a variety of instruments deployed from ships and airplanes and, more recently, underwater robots. Thus, the data must be carefully adjusted to account for differences among measurement techniques and data collection programs. Figure 1 shows four independent interpretations of essentially the same underlying data for the top 700 meters of the ocean, and Figure 2 shows three independent interpretations for the top 2,000 meters of the ocean. Data must be carefully reconstructed and filtered for biases because of different data collection techniques and uneven sampling over time and space. Various methods of correcting the data have led to slightly different versions of the ocean heat trend line. Scientists continue to compare their results and improve their estimates over time. They also test their ocean heat estimates by looking at corresponding changes in other properties of the ocean. For example, they can check to see whether observed changes in sea level match the amount of sea level rise that would be expected based on the estimated change in ocean heat. Data for this indicator were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other organizations around the world. The data were analyzed independently by researchers at NOAA, Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, China’s Institute of Atmospheric Physics, and the Japan Meteorological Agency’s Meteorological Research Institute."},

Covering about 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, the world’s oceans have a two-way relationship with weather and climate. The oceans influence the weather on local to global scales, while changes in climate can fundamentally alter many properties of the oceans. This chapter examines how some of these important characteristics of the oceans have changed over time. As greenhouse gases trap more energy from the sun, the oceans are absorbing more heat, resulting in an increase in sea surface temperatures and rising sea level. Changes in ocean temperatures and currents brought about by climate change will lead to alterations in climate patterns around the world. For example, warmer waters may promote the development of stronger storms in the tropics, which can cause property damage and loss of life. The impacts associated with sea level rise and stronger storm surges are especially relevant to coastal communities. Although the oceans help reduce climate change by storing large amounts of carbon dioxide, increasing levels of dissolved carbon are changing the chemistry of seawater and making it more acidic. Increased ocean acidity makes it more difficult for certain organisms, such as corals and shellfish, to build their skeletons and shells. These effects, in turn, could substantially alter the biodiversity and productivity of ocean ecosystems. Changes in ocean systems generally occur over much longer time periods than in the atmosphere, where storms can form and dissipate in a single day. Interactions between the oceans and atmosphere occur slowly over many months to years, and so does the movement of water within the oceans, including the mixing of deep and shallow waters. Thus, trends can persist for decades, centuries, or longer. For this reason, even if greenhouse gas emissions were stabilized tomorrow, it would take many more years—decades to centuries—for the oceans to adjust to changes in the atmosphere and the climate that have already occurred."},

This feature provides a closer look at trends in temperature and drought in the southwestern United States. This map shows how the average air temperature from 2000 to 2020 has differed from the long-term average (1895–2020). To provide more detailed information, each state has been divided into climate divisions, which are zones that share similar climate features. Data source: NOAA, 2021 \n This chart shows the percentage of land area in six southwestern states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) classified under drought conditions from 2000 through 2020. This figure uses the U.S. Drought Monitor classification system, which is described in the table in the   indicator. Data source: National Drought Mitigation Center, 2021 \n This chart shows annual values of the Palmer Drought Severity Index, averaged over six states in the Southwest (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah). Positive values represent wetter-than-average conditions, while negative values represent drier-than-average conditions. A value between -2 and -3 indicates moderate drought, -3 to -4 is severe drought, and -4 or below indicates extreme drought. The thicker line is a nine-year weighted average. Data source: NOAA, 2021 \n The American Southwest might evoke images of a hot, dry landscape—a land of rock, canyons, and deserts baked by the sun. Indeed, much of this region has low annual rainfall and seasonally high temperatures that contribute to its characteristic desert climate. Yet this landscape actually supports a vast array of plants and animals, along with millions of people who call the Southwest home. All of these plants, animals, and people need water to survive. Water is already scarce in the Southwest, so every drop is a precious resource. People in the Southwest are particularly dependent on surface water supplies like Lake Mead, which are vulnerable to evaporation. Thus, even a small increase in temperature (which drives evaporation) or a decrease in precipitation in this already arid region can seriously threaten natural systems and society. Droughts also contribute to increased pest outbreaks and wildfires, both of which damage local economies, and they reduce the amount of water available for generating electricity—for example, at the Hoover Dam. While two indicators in this report present information about unusually high or low temperatures and drought on a national scale (see the   indicator and the   indicator), this feature highlights the Southwest because of its particular sensitivity to temperature and drought. Parts of the Southwest are also experiencing long-term reductions in mountain snowpack (see the   indicator), which accounts for a large portion of the region’s water supply. This feature focuses on six states that are commonly thought of as “southwestern” and characterized at least in part by arid landscapes and scarce water supplies: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. Temperature and drought data come from a network of thousands of weather stations overseen by the National Weather Service. The map in Figure 1 shows how average annual temperatures in the Southwest from 2000 to 2020 differed from the average over the entire period since widespread temperature records became available (1895–2020). Figures 2 and 3 show two ways of measuring drought in the Southwest: the Drought Monitor and the Palmer Drought Severity Index. The Palmer Index is calculated from precipitation and temperature measurements at weather stations, and has been used widely for many years. The Drought Monitor is a more recent and more detailed index based on several other indices (including Palmer), along with additional factors such as snow water content, groundwater levels, reservoir storage, pasture/range conditions, and other impacts. See the   indicator for more information about these indices. For this and other examples of community connections to observed climate-related changes, see the StoryMap at:  . Natural variability, changes in irrigation practices, and other diversions of water for human use can influence certain drought-related measurements. Soil moisture, ground water, and streamflow are part of Drought Monitor calculations (Figure 2), and they are all sensitive to human activities.

For a map of current drought conditions, visit the Drought Monitor website at:  . There are many definitions and types of drought. Meteorologists generally define drought as a prolonged period of dry weather caused by a lack of precipitation that results in a serious water shortage for some activity, population, or ecological system. Drought can also be thought of as an extended imbalance between precipitation and evaporation. As average temperatures have risen because of climate change, the Earth’s water cycle has sped up through an increase in the rate of evaporation from the Earth’s surface (including soil, lakes, and reservoirs) and transpiration from plants. An increase in evapotranspiration makes more water available in the air for precipitation, but contributes to drying over some land areas, leaving less moisture in the soil. As the climate continues to change, many historically wet areas are likely to experience increased precipitation (see the   indicator) and increased risk of flooding (see the   indicator), while historically dry areas are likely to experience less precipitation and increased risk of drought.   As a result, since the 1950s, some regions of the world have experienced an increase in some types of drought, including western North America, southern Europe, and much of Africa. Drought conditions can negatively affect agriculture, water supplies, energy production, human health, and many other aspects of society. The impacts vary depending on the type, location, intensity, and duration of the drought. For example, effects on agriculture can range from slowed plant growth to severe crop losses, while water supply impacts can range from lowered reservoir levels and dried-up streams to major water shortages. Prolonged droughts pose a particular threat to indigenous populations because of their economic and cultural dependence on land and water supplies. Warming and drought can threaten medicinal and culturally important plants and animals and can reduce water quality and availability, making tribal populations particularly vulnerable to waterborne illnesses.  Lower streamflow and groundwater levels can also harm ecosystems more broadly, by harming plants and animals and increasing the risk of wildfires (see the  During the 20  century, many indices were created to measure drought severity by looking at precipitation, soil moisture, stream flow, vegetation health, and other variables.  Figure 1 shows annual values of the most widely used index, the Palmer Drought Severity Index, which is calculated from precipitation and temperature measurements at weather stations. An index value of zero represents the average moisture conditions observed between 1931 and 1990 at a given location. A positive value means conditions are wetter than average, while a negative value is drier than average. Index values from locations across the contiguous 48 states have been averaged together to produce the national values shown in Figure 1. Figures 2 and 3 show the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which measures the combination of water supply (precipitation) and atmospheric water demand (evapotranspiration, which is based on temperature) to determine whether a certain area is experiencing extreme drought, extreme moisture, or conditions in between. This combination of inputs is useful because it allows the SPEI to consider how droughts might affect agriculture and ecosystems, which depend on a balance between water supply and demand. SPEI values between -1 and 1 are considered near normal for a given area, whereas values below -1 signify drought and values above 1 signify unusually moist conditions. Because drought conditions fluctuate naturally, it is helpful to look at average conditions over several years to explore how drought is connected to long-term climate change.   For this reason, this indicator presents average SPEI values over consecutive five-year periods. For example, the 2023 SPEI score for a particular area is actually the average of 60 months of SPEI data, from July 2018 through June 2023. For a more detailed perspective on recent trends, Figure 4 shows an index called the Drought Monitor, which is based on several indices (including Palmer), along with additional factors such as snow water content, groundwater levels, reservoir storage, pasture/range conditions, and other impacts. The Drought Monitor uses codes from D0 to D4 (see table below Figure 4) to classify drought severity. This part of the indicator covers all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Natural variability in the Earth’s climate means that drought trends may vary slightly when measured over different time periods. Using a multi-year index as shown in Figures 2 and 3 (five-year SPEI) is relevant for examining climate trends and potential connections to climate change.  Periods with extreme drought conditions (e.g., 1930s) can influence the long-term trends calculated for this indicator. The SPEI values used for this indicator are based on weighted PRISM data by location.  The underlying method for calculating SPEI does not account for variables such as solar radiation, humidity, and wind speed that can all influence drought conditions. As a result, the SPEI shown here is more reflective of the influence of temperature. This is a limitation and potential source of uncertainty in interpreting drought conditions. The U.S. Drought Monitor (Figure 4) offers a closer look at the percentage of the country that is affected by drought. The period of record for this index is relatively short, however, and thus too short-lived to be used for assessing long-term climate trends or exploring how recent observations compare with historical patterns. With several decades of data collection, future versions of this indicator should be able to paint a more complete picture of trends over time. Overall, this indicator gives a broad overview of drought conditions in the United States. It is not intended to replace local information that might describe conditions more precisely for a particular region. The national averages in Figures 1 and 2 are particularly limited in this regard, as averaging drought metrics over such a large area can obscure drought extremes occurring at regional scales. Thus, these national graphs might understate the degree to which droughts are becoming more severe in some areas while other places receive more rain as a result of climate change.

This indicator examines changes in the size and frequency of inland river flood events in the United States. This figure shows changes in the size of flooding events in rivers and streams in the United States between 1965 and 2015. Blue upward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become larger; brown downward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become smaller. The larger, solid-color symbols represent stations where the change was statistically significant. Data source: Slater and Villarini, 2016 \n This figure shows changes in the frequency of flooding events in rivers and streams in the United States between 1965 and 2015. Blue upward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become more frequent; brown downward-pointing symbols show locations where floods have become less frequent. The larger, solid-color symbols represent stations where the change was statistically significant. Data source: Slater and Villarini, 2016 \n Rivers and streams experience flooding as a natural result of large rain storms or spring snowmelt that quickly drains into streams and rivers. Although the risk for flooding varies across the United States, most areas are susceptible to floods, even in dry and mountainous regions. The size, or magnitude, of flood events is influenced by how much water enters the waterway upstream—and how quickly. Flood frequency largely depends on the frequency of weather events. Large flood events can damage homes, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure; wipe out farmers’ crops; and harm or displace people. Although regular flooding helps to maintain the nutrient balance of soils in the flood plain, larger or more frequent floods could disrupt ecosystems by displacing aquatic life, impairing water quality, and increasing soil erosion. By inundating water treatment systems with sediment and contaminants, and promoting the growth of harmful microbes, floods can directly affect the water supplies that communities depend on. Climate change may cause river floods to become larger or more frequent than they used to be in some places, yet become smaller and less frequent in other places. As warmer temperatures cause more water to evaporate from the land and oceans, changes in the size and frequency of heavy precipitation events may in turn affect the size and frequency of river flooding (see the   indicator).  Changes in streamflow, the timing of snowmelt (see the   indicator), and the amount of snowpack that accumulates in the winter (see the   indicator) can also affect flood patterns. The U.S. Geological Survey maintains thousands of stream gauges across the United States. Each gauge measures water level and discharge—the amount of water flowing past the gauge. This indicator uses total daily discharge data from about 500 long-term stream gauge stations where trends are not substantially influenced by dams, reservoir management, wastewater treatment facilities, or land-use change. One way to determine whether the magnitude of flooding has changed is by studying the largest flood event from each year. This indicator examines the maximum discharge from every year at every station to identify whether peak flows have generally increased or decreased. This indicator also analyzes whether large flood events have become more or less frequent over time, based on daily discharge records. This indicator starts in 1965 because flood data have been available for a large number of sites to support a national-level analysis since then.  This indicator is based on U.S. stream gauges that have recorded data consistently since 1965. Besides climate change, many other types of human influences could affect the frequency and magnitude of floods—for example, dams, floodwater management activities, agricultural practices, and changes in land use. To remove these influences, this indicator focuses on a set of sites that are not heavily influenced by human activities, in watersheds that do not have a large proportion of impervious surfaces such as concrete and asphalt. Increased flooding does not necessarily result in an increased risk to people or property if an area has protective infrastructure, such as levees or floodwalls. Daily stream gauge data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. These data came from a set of gauges in watersheds with minimal human impacts, which have been classified as reference gauges.  Daily discharge data are stored in the National Water Information System and are publicly available at:  ."},

Data source: NOAA, 2023 \n This figure presents annual values of the Power Dissipation Index (PDI), which accounts for cyclone strength, duration, and frequency. Tropical North Atlantic sea surface temperature trends are provided for reference. Note that sea surface temperature is measured in different units, but the values have been plotted alongside the PDI to show how they compare. The lines have been smoothed using a five-year weighted average, plotted at the middle year. The most recent average (2018–2022) is plotted at 2020. Data source: Emanuel, 2023 \n Hurricanes, tropical storms, and other intense rotating storms fall into a general category called cyclones. There are two main types of cyclones: tropical and extratropical (those that form outside the tropics). Tropical cyclones get their energy from warm tropical oceans. Extratropical cyclones get their energy from the jet stream and from temperature differences between cold, dry air masses from higher latitudes and warm, moist air masses from lower latitudes. This indicator focuses on tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. Tropical cyclones are most common during the “hurricane season,” which runs from June through November. The effects of tropical cyclones are numerous and well known. At sea, storms disrupt and endanger shipping traffic. When cyclones encounter land, their intense rains and high winds can cause severe property and infrastructure damage, loss of life, soil erosion, and flooding. The associated storm surge—the large volume of ocean water pushed toward shore by the cyclone’s strong winds—can cause severe flooding, erosion, and destruction. Climate change is expected to affect tropical cyclones by increasing sea surface temperatures, a key factor that influences cyclone formation and behavior. The U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change project that tropical cyclones will become more intense over the 21  century, with higher wind speeds and heavier rains. Records of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean have been collected since the 1800s. The most reliable long-term records focus on hurricanes, which are the strongest category of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, with wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour. This indicator uses historical data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to track the number of hurricanes per year in the North Atlantic (north of the equator) and the number reaching the United States since 1878. Some hurricanes over the ocean might have been missed before the start of aircraft and satellite observation, so scientists have used other evidence, such as ship traffic records, to estimate the actual number of hurricanes that might have formed in earlier years. This indicator also looks at the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index and the Power Dissipation Index (PDI), which are two ways of monitoring the frequency, strength, and duration of tropical cyclones based on wind speed measurements. Every cyclone has an ACE Index value, which is a number based on the maximum wind speed measured at six-hour intervals over the entire time that the cyclone is classified as at least a tropical storm (wind speed of at least 39 miles per hour). Therefore, a storm’s ACE Index value accounts for both strength and duration. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calculates the total ACE Index value for an entire hurricane season by adding the values for all named storms, including subtropical storms, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The resulting annual total accounts for cyclone strength, duration, and frequency. For this indicator, the index has been converted to a scale where 100 equals the median value (the midpoint) over a base period from 1951 to 2020. The thresholds in Figure 2 define whether the ACE Index for a given year is close to normal, significantly above normal, or significantly below normal. Like the ACE Index, the PDI is based on measurements of wind speed, but it uses a different calculation method that places more emphasis on storm intensity. This indicator shows the annual PDI value, which represents the sum of PDI values for all named storms during the year. Over time, data collection methods have changed as technology has improved. For example, wind speed collection methods have evolved substantially over the past 60 years, while aircraft reconnaissance began in 1944 and satellite tracking around 1966. Figure 1 shows how older hurricane counts have been adjusted to attempt to account for the lack of aircraft and satellite observations. Changes in data gathering technologies could substantially influence the overall patterns in Figures 2 and 3. The effects of these changes on data consistency over the life of the indicator would benefit from additional research. While Figures 2 and 3 cover several different aspects of tropical cyclones, there are other important factors not covered here, including the size of each storm, the amount of rain, and the height of the storm surge. The reason for the recent divergence between cyclone activity and sea surface temperature in Figure 3 has not been identified conclusively, but it may relate to other factors that influence the formation of storms, such as the difference in wind speeds at different levels in the atmosphere (called vertical wind shear) and the concentration of particles called aerosols in the atmosphere. Hurricane counts were compiled using methods described in Knutson et al. (2010).  Data for Figures 1 and 2 came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Research Division, and are available online at:  . Values for Figure 3 have been calculated by Kerry Emanuel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both the ACE Index and the PDI are based on wind speed measurements compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."},

The data are shown for climate divisions, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n Precipitation can have wide-ranging effects on human well-being and ecosystems. Rainfall, snowfall, and the timing of snowmelt can all affect the amount of surface water and groundwater available for drinking, irrigation, and industry. They also influence river flooding and can determine what types of animals and plants (including crops) can survive in a particular place. Changes in precipitation can disrupt a wide range of natural processes, particularly if these changes occur more quickly than plant and animal species can adapt. As average temperatures at the Earth’s surface rise (see the   indicator), more evaporation and transpiration occur, adding more moisture to the air, which in turn increases overall precipitation. Therefore, a warming climate is expected to increase precipitation in many areas. Just as precipitation patterns vary across the world, however, so do the effects of climate change on precipitation. By shifting the wind patterns and ocean currents that drive the world’s climate system, climate change will also cause some areas to experience decreased precipitation. In addition, areas with increased precipitation will not necessarily have more water available for people and ecosystems because higher temperatures also lead to more evaporation (see the   indicator). This indicator examines U.S. and global precipitation patterns, based on rainfall and snowfall measurements from land-based weather stations worldwide. This indicator starts at 1901 except for the detailed map of Alaska, where reliable statewide records are available back to 1925. The indicator extends through 2023. This indicator shows annual anomalies, or differences, compared with the average precipitation from 1901 to 2000. At each weather station, annual precipitation anomalies were calculated from total annual precipitation in inches. Anomalies for the contiguous 48 states and Alaska have been determined by calculating average precipitation anomalies for areas within each state based on station density and topography. These regional anomalies are then averaged together in proportion to their area to develop national results. Similarly, global anomalies have been determined by dividing the world into a grid, averaging the data for each cell of the grid, and then averaging the grid cells together. Data from the early 20  century are somewhat less precise because there were fewer stations collecting measurements at the time. To ensure that overall trends are reliable, the data have been adjusted where possible to account for any biases that might be introduced by factors such as station relocation or changes in measurement instruments. Hawai'i and U.S. territories are not included, due to limitations in available data.

Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n This figure shows the percentage of the land area of the contiguous 48 states that experienced much greater than normal precipitation in any given year, which means it scored 2.0 or above on the annual Standardized Precipitation Index. The thicker line shows a nine-year weighted average that smooths out some of the year-to-year fluctuations. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n \"Heavy precipitation\" refers to instances during which the amount of rain or snow experienced in a location substantially exceeds what is normal. What constitutes a period of heavy precipitation varies according to location and season. Climate change can affect the intensity and frequency of precipitation. Warmer oceans increase the amount of water that evaporates into the air. When more moisture-laden air moves over land or converges into a storm system, it can produce more intense precipitation—for example, heavier rain and snow storms.  The potential impacts of heavy precipitation include crop damage, soil erosion, and an increase in flood risk due to heavy rains (see the   indicator)—which in turn can lead to injuries, drownings, respiratory health impacts from exposure to mold, and other flooding-related effects on health.  In addition, runoff from precipitation can impair water quality as pollutants deposited on land wash into water bodies. Heavy precipitation does not necessarily mean the total amount of precipitation at a location has increased—just that precipitation is occurring in more intense events. However, changes in the intensity of precipitation, when combined with changes in the interval between precipitation events, can also lead to changes in overall precipitation totals. Heavy precipitation events can be measured by tracking their frequency, examining their return period (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or directly measuring the amount of precipitation in a certain period (for example, inches of rain falling in a 24-hour period). One way to track heavy precipitation is by calculating what percentage of a particular location’s total precipitation in a given year has come in the form of extreme one-day events—or, in other words, what percentage of precipitation is arriving in more concentrated periods of time. Figure 1 of this indicator looks at the prevalence of extreme single-day precipitation events over time. For added insight, this indicator also tracks the occurrence of unusually high total yearly precipitation. It does so by looking at the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), which compares actual yearly precipitation totals with the range of precipitation totals that one would typically expect at a specific location, based on historical data. If a location experiences less precipitation than normal during a particular period, it will receive a negative SPI score, while a period with more precipitation than normal will receive a positive score. The more precipitation (compared with normal), the higher the SPI score. The SPI is a useful way to look at precipitation totals because it allows comparison of different locations and different seasons on a standard scale. Figure 2 shows what percentage of the total area of the contiguous 48 states had an annual SPI score of 2.0 or above (well above normal) in any given year. Weather monitoring stations tend to be closer together in the eastern and central states than in the western states. In areas with fewer monitoring stations, heavy precipitation indicators are less likely to reflect local conditions accurately. The data used for this indicator come from a large national network of weather stations and were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Centers for Environmental Information. Figure 1 is based on Step #4 of NOAA’s U.S. Climate Extremes Index; for data and a description of the index, see:  . Figure 2 is based on the U.S. SPI, which is shown in a variety of maps available online at:  . The data used to construct these maps are available at:  . "},

This indicator describes trends in multi-day extreme heat events across the United States. This figure shows changes in the number of heat waves per year (frequency); the average length of heat waves in days (duration); the number of days between the first and last heat wave of the year (season length); and how hot the heat waves were, compared with the local temperature threshold for defining a heat wave (intensity). These data were analyzed from 1961 to 2023 for 50 large metropolitan areas. The graphs show averages across all 50 metropolitan areas by decade. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n These maps show changes in the number of heat waves per year (frequency); the average length of heat waves in days (duration); the number of days between the first and last heat wave of the year (season length); and how hot the heat waves were, compared with the local temperature threshold for defining a heat wave (intensity). These data were analyzed from 1961 to 2023 for 50 large metropolitan areas. The size of each circle indicates the total change over the period measured. Solid-color circles represent cities where the trend was statistically significant. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n This figure shows the annual values of the U.S. Heat Wave Index from 1895 to 2021. These data cover the contiguous 48 states. An index value of 0.2 (for example) could mean that 20 percent of the country experienced one heat wave, 10 percent of the country experienced two heat waves, or some other combination of frequency and area resulted in this value. Data source: Kunkel, 2022 \n A persistent period of unusually hot days is referred to as an extreme heat event or a heat wave. Heat waves are more than just uncomfortable: they can lead to illness and death, particularly among older adults, the very young, and other vulnerable populations (see the   and   indicators).  Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to other impacts as well—for example, damaging crops, injuring or killing livestock, and increasing the risk of wildfires. Prolonged periods of extreme heat can lead to power outages as heavy demands for air conditioning strain the power grid. Unusually hot days and heat wave events are a natural part of day-to-day variation in weather. As the Earth’s climate warms, however, hotter-than-usual days and nights are becoming more common (see the   indicator) and heat waves are expected to last longer and become more frequent and intense.  Increases in these extreme heat events can lead to more heat-related illnesses and deaths, especially if people and communities do not take steps to adapt.  Even small increases in extreme heat can result in increased deaths and illnesses. This indicator examines trends over time in four key characteristics of heat waves in the United States: Heat waves can be defined in many different ways. For consistency across the country, Figures 1 and 2 define a heat wave as a period of two or more consecutive days when the daily minimum apparent temperature (the actual temperature adjusted for humidity) in a particular city exceeds the 85  percentile of historical July and August temperatures (1981–2010) for that city. EPA chose this definition for several reasons: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) calculated apparent temperature for this indicator based on temperature and humidity measurements from long-term weather stations, which are generally located at airports. Figures 1 and 2 focus on the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas that have recorded weather data from a consistent location without many missing days over the time period examined. The year 1961 was chosen as the starting point because most major cities have collected consistent data since at least that time. Figure 3 provides another perspective to gauge the size and frequency of prolonged heat wave events. It shows the U.S. Annual Heat Wave Index, which tracks the occurrence of heat wave conditions across the contiguous 48 states from 1895 to 2021. This index defines a heat wave as a period lasting at least four days with an average temperature that would only be expected to persist over four days once every 10 years, based on the historical record. The index value for a given year depends on how often such severe heat waves occur and how widespread they are. As cities develop, vegetation is often lost, and more surfaces are paved or covered with buildings. This type of development can lead to higher temperatures—part of an effect called an “urban heat island.” Compared with surrounding rural areas, built-up areas have higher temperatures, especially at night.  Urban growth since 1961 may have contributed to part of the increase in heat waves that Figures 1 and 2 show for certain cities. This indicator does not attempt to adjust for the effects of development in metropolitan areas, because it focuses on the temperatures to which people are actually exposed, regardless of whether the trends reflect a combination of climate change and other factors. Figures 1 and 2 focus on the 50 most populous metropolitan areas that had complete data for the entire period from 1961 to 2023. Several large metropolitan areas did not have enough data, such as New York City, Houston, Minneapolis–St. Paul, and Denver. In some of these cases, the best available long-term weather station was relocated sometime between 1961 and 2023—for example, when a new airport opened. As noted above, Figures 1 and 2 focus on daily minimum temperatures because of the connection between nighttime cooling (or lack thereof) and human health. For reference, EPA’s technical documentation for this indicator shows the results of a similar analysis based on daily maximum temperatures. Temperature data are less certain for the early part of the 20  century because fewer stations were operating at that time. In addition, measuring devices and methods have changed over time, and some stations have moved. The data in Figure 3 have been adjusted to the extent possible to account for some of these influences and biases, however, and these uncertainties are not sufficient to change the fundamental nature of the trends. Figures 1 and 2 are adapted from an analysis by Habeeb et al. (2015).  They are based on temperature and humidity measurements from weather stations managed by NOAA’s National Weather Service. NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information compiled and provided the data. Figure 3 is based on measurements from weather stations in the National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Network. The data are available online at:  .

Thus, the maximum temperature on a particular day at a particular station would be considered “unusually hot” if it falls within the warmest 5 percent of measurements at that station during the 1948–2023 period. The map shows changes in the total number of days per year that were hotter than the 95  percentile. Red upward-pointing symbols show where these unusually hot days are becoming more common.

Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n This figure shows the percentage of daily temperature records set at weather stations across the contiguous 48 states by decade. Record highs (red) are compared with record lows (blue).  Data source: Meehl et al., 2009 \n Unusually hot or cold temperatures can result in prolonged extreme weather events like summer heat waves (see the   indicator) or winter cold spells. Heat waves can lead to illness and death, particularly among older adults, the very young, and other vulnerable populations (see the   and   indicators).  People can also die from exposure to extreme cold (hypothermia) (see the   indicator). In addition, prolonged exposure to excessive heat and cold can damage crops and injure or kill livestock. Extreme heat can lead to power outages as heavy demands for air conditioning strain the power grid, while extremely cold weather increases the need for heating fuel. Record-setting daily temperatures, heat waves, and cold spells are a natural part of day-to-day variation in weather. As the Earth’s climate warms overall, however, temperatures that are unusually hot for a given location are expected to increase.  Higher values of the heat index (which combines temperature and humidity to describe perceived temperature) are expected to increase discomfort and aggravate health issues. Conversely, cold spells are expected to decrease. In most locations, scientists expect the number of warm days and warm nights to increase.  This change will provide less opportunity to cool off and recover from daytime heat. This indicator examines trends in unusual temperatures from several perspectives: The data come from thousands of weather stations across the United States. National patterns can be determined by dividing the country into a grid and examining the data for one station in each cell of the grid. This method ensures that the results are not biased toward regions that happen to have many stations close together. Figures 1 and 2 show trends in the percentage of the country’s area experiencing unusually hot temperatures in the summer and unusually cold temperatures in the winter. These graphs are based on daily maximum temperatures, which usually occur during the day, and daily minimum temperatures, which usually occur at night. At each station, the recorded highs and lows are compared with the full set of historical records. After averaging over a particular month or season of interest, the coldest 10 percent of years are considered “unusually cold” and the warmest 10 percent are “unusually hot.” For example, if last year’s summer highs were the 10  warmest on record for a particular location with more than 100 years of data, that year’s summer highs would be considered unusually warm. Data are available from 1910 to 2023 for summer (June through August) and from 1911 to 2024 for winter (December of the previous year through February). Figures 3 and 4 show how trends in unusually hot and cold daily temperatures throughout the year vary by location. These maps cover about 1,050 weather stations that have operated since 1948. Figure 3 was created by reviewing all daily maximum temperatures from 1948 to 2023 and identifying the 95  percentile temperature (a temperature that one would only expect to exceed in five days out of every 100) at each station. Next, for each year, the total number of days with maximum temperatures higher than the 95  percentile (that is, unusually hot days) was determined. The map shows how the total number of unusually hot days per year at each station has changed over time. Figure 4 is similar except that it looks at unusually cold days, based on the 5  percentile of daily minimum temperatures and reviews daily minimum winter temperatures from 1911 to 2023. Many people are familiar with record daily high and low temperatures, which are frequently mentioned in weather reports. Figure 5 depicts trends in these records by comparing the number of record-setting highs with the number of record-setting lows by decade. These data come from a set of weather stations that have collected data consistently since 1950. Temperature data are less certain for the early part of the 20  century because fewer stations were operating at that time. In addition, measuring devices and methods have changed over time, and some stations have moved. The data have been adjusted to the extent possible to account for some of these influences and biases, however, and these uncertainties are not sufficient to change the fundamental trends shown in the figures. The data for this indicator are based on measurements from weather stations managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figures 1 and 2 come from the U.S. Climate Extremes Index, which is based on a smaller group of long-term weather stations that are tracked by the National Centers for Environmental Information and referred to as the U.S. Historical Climatology Network.

This graph uses the 1901–2000 average as a baseline for depicting change. Choosing a different baseline period would not change the shape of the data over time. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n This figure shows how annual average air temperatures have changed in different parts of the United States since the early 20  century (since 1901 for the contiguous 48 states and 1925 for Alaska). The data are shown for climate divisions, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n Temperature is a fundamental measurement for describing the climate, and the temperature in particular places can have wide-ranging effects on human life and ecosystems. For example, increases in air temperature can lead to more intense heat waves (see the   indicator), which can cause illness and death, especially in vulnerable populations. Annual and seasonal temperature patterns also determine the types of animals and plants that can survive in particular locations. Changes in temperature can disrupt a wide range of natural processes, particularly if these changes occur more quickly than plant and animal species can adapt. Concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are increasing in the Earth’s atmosphere (see the   indicator). In response, average temperatures at the Earth’s surface are increasing and are expected to continue rising.  Because climate change can shift the wind patterns and ocean currents that drive the world’s climate system, some areas are warming more than others, and some have experienced cooling. This indicator examines U.S. and global surface temperature patterns over time. U.S. surface measurements come from weather stations on land, while global surface measurements also incorporate observations from buoys and ships on the ocean, thereby providing data from sites spanning much of the surface of the Earth. This indicator starts at 1901 except for the detailed map of Alaska, where reliable statewide records are available back to 1925. For comparison, this indicator also displays satellite measurements that can be used to estimate the temperature of the Earth’s lower atmosphere since 1979. This indicator shows annual anomalies, or differences, compared with the average temperature from 1901 to 2000. For example, an anomaly of +2.0 degrees means the average temperature was 2 degrees higher than the long-term average. Anomalies have been calculated for each weather station. Daily temperature measurements at each site were used to calculate monthly anomalies, which were then averaged to find an annual temperature anomaly for each year. Anomalies for the contiguous 48 states and Alaska have been determined by calculating average anomalies for areas within each state based on station density, interpolation, and topography. These regional anomalies are then averaged together in proportion to their area to develop national results. Similarly, global anomalies have been determined by dividing the world into a grid, averaging the data for each cell of the grid, and then averaging the grid cells together. Data from the early 20  century are somewhat less precise than more recent data because there were fewer stations collecting measurements at the time, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. The overall trends are still reliable, however. Where possible, the data have been adjusted to account for any biases that might be introduced by factors such as station moves, urbanization near the station, changes in measuring instruments, and changes in the exact times at which measurements are taken. Hawaii and U.S. territories are not included, due to limitations in available data. The data for this indicator were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, which maintains a large collection of climate data online at:  . The surface temperature anomalies shown here were calculated based on monthly values from a network of long-term monitoring stations. Satellite data were analyzed by two independent groups—the Global Hydrology and Climate Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and Remote Sensing Systems (RSS)—resulting in slightly different trend lines."},

This indicator describes trends in average temperatures for each season across the United States. This figure shows changes in the average temperature for each season across the contiguous 48 states from 1896 to 2023. Seasons are defined as follows: December, January, and February for winter; March, April, and May for spring; June, July, and August for summer; and September, October, and November for fall.

Seasons are defined as follows: December, January, and February for winter; March, April, and May for spring; June, July, and August for summer; and September, October, and November for fall. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n This figure shows changes in the average annual temperature by season for the contiguous 48 states from 1896 to 2023, in degrees Fahrenheit. Seasons are defined as follows: December, January, and February for winter; March, April, and May for spring; June, July, and August for summer; and September, October, and November for fall. Data source: NOAA, 2024 \n As the Earth warms overall, average temperatures increase throughout the year (see the   indicator), but the increases may be larger in certain seasons than in others. The winter is particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures. Overall, minimum temperatures have increased at a higher rate than average maximum temperatures.  Much of the observed warming in the United States has taken place when and where it is usually the coldest—namely, during winter,  at night, and in the northern parts of the country. Although the United States has experienced many winters with unusually low temperatures, unusually cold winter temperatures have become less common—particularly very cold nights (lows)  (see also the   indicator). Changing winter temperatures directly influence the amount of snow that falls and accumulates, amount of seasonal snowpack, timing of snowmelt runoff, loss of soil moisture through evapotranspiration, and amount of time that lakes are frozen (see the  ,  , and   indicators). These changes are reducing water supplies—particularly in western states that depend heavily on snowpack—and threatening winter recreation and tourism, an industry worth $12 to 20 billion a year in the United States. Warming in other seasons can also affect daily life in various ways. For example, warmer spring and fall temperatures extend the growing season (see the   indicator), which can benefit some forms of agriculture but also lead to a longer and more intense pollen season for allergy sufferers (see the   indicator). These changes could also extend the wildfire season. A warmer summer likely means more money spent on air conditioning, while a warmer winter could mean less money spent on home heating (see the   indicator). Seasonal warming could also disrupt the timing of events that are important for plants and animals, such as budding, flower blooms, hibernation, egg-laying, hatching, and migration. This indicator examines changes in average temperatures in each season, defined here by calendar month (for example, winter is December, January, and February). The indicator is based on daily temperature measurements from more than 10,000 weather stations located across the contiguous 48 states. Starting in 1896, this indicator shows annual anomalies, or differences, compared with the long-term average seasonal temperatures from 1901 to 2000 (Figure 1). For example, an anomaly of +2.0°F in a winter means the average winter temperature was 2 degrees higher than the long-term average. Anomalies have been calculated for each weather station. Daily temperature measurements at each site were used to calculate monthly anomalies, which were then averaged for each season to find temperature anomalies for each year. Average anomalies are calculated for areas within each state based on station density and proximity, as well as the topography of the area. These sub-state-level anomalies are then averaged together in proportion to their area to develop state and national results. Data from the early part of the time period are somewhat less precise than more recent data because there were fewer stations collecting measurements at the time. The overall trends are still reliable, however. Where possible, the data have been adjusted to account for any biases that might be introduced by factors such as station moves, urbanization near the station, changes in measuring instruments, and changes in the exact times at which measurements are taken.

Rising global average temperature is associated with widespread changes in weather patterns. Scientific studies indicate that extreme weather events such as heat waves and large storms are likely to become more frequent or more intense with human-induced climate change. This chapter focuses on observed changes in temperature, precipitation, storms, floods, and droughts. Long-term changes in climate can directly or indirectly affect many aspects of society in potentially disruptive ways. For example, warmer average temperatures could increase air conditioning costs and affect the spread of diseases like Lyme disease, but could also improve conditions for growing some crops. More extreme variations in weather are also a threat to society. More frequent and intense extreme heat events can increase illnesses and deaths, especially among vulnerable populations, and damage some crops. While increased precipitation can replenish water supplies and support agriculture, intense storms can damage property, cause loss of life and population displacement, and temporarily disrupt essential services such as transportation, telecommunications, energy, and water supplies. is the state of the atmosphere at any given time and place. Most of the weather that affects people, agriculture, and ecosystems takes place in the lower layer of the atmosphere. Familiar aspects of weather include temperature, precipitation, clouds, and wind that people experience throughout the course of a day. Severe weather conditions include hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and droughts.  is the long-term average of the weather in a given place. While the weather can change in minutes or hours, a change in climate is something that develops over longer periods of decades to centuries. Climate is defined not only by average temperature and precipitation but also by the type, frequency, duration, and intensity of weather events such as heat waves, cold spells, storms, floods, and droughts. The concepts of climate and weather are often confused, so it may be helpful to think about the difference between weather and climate with an analogy: weather influences what clothes you wear on a given day, while the climate where you live influences the entire wardrobe you buy. "},

Data source: Compilation of six underlying datasets \n This figure shows concentrations of several halogenated gases (which contain fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) in the atmosphere, measured in parts per trillion (ppt). The data come from monitoring sites around the world. Note that the scale increases by factors of 10. This is because the concentrations of different halogenated gases can vary by a few orders of magnitude. The numbers following the name of each gas (e.g., HCFC-22) are used to denote specific types of those particular gases. Data sources: AGAGE, 2022;  NOAA, 2023;  Rigby, 2017 \n This figure shows the average amount of ozone in the Earth’s atmosphere each year, based on satellite measurements. The total represents the “thickness” or density of ozone throughout all layers of the Earth’s atmosphere, which is called total column ozone and measured in Dobson units. Higher numbers indicate more ozone. For most years, Figure 5 shows how this ozone is divided between the troposphere (the part of the atmosphere closest to the ground) and the stratosphere. From 1994 to 1996, only the total is available, due to limited satellite coverage. Data sources: NASA, 2013,  2021,  2022 \n Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Human activities have only a small direct influence on atmospheric concentrations of water vapor, primarily through irrigation and deforestation, so it is not included in this indicator.  The surface warming caused by human production of other greenhouse gases, however, leads to an increase in atmospheric water vapor because warmer temperatures make it easier for water to evaporate and stay in the air in vapor form. This creates a positive “feedback loop” in which warming leads to more warming. Since the Industrial Revolution began in the 1700s, people have added a substantial amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests, and conducting other activities (see the   and   Greenhouse Gas Emissions indicators). When greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, many remain there for long time periods ranging from a decade to many millennia. Over time, these gases are removed from the atmosphere by chemical reactions or by emissions sinks, such as the oceans and vegetation, which absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. As a result of human activities, however, these gases are entering the atmosphere more quickly than they are being removed from it, and thus their concentrations are increasing. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and certain manufactured gases called halogenated gases (gases that contain chlorine, fluorine, or bromine) become well mixed throughout the global atmosphere because of their relatively long lifetimes and because of transport by winds. Concentrations of these greenhouse gases are measured in parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb), or parts per trillion (ppt) by volume. In other words, a concentration of 1 ppb for a given gas means there is one molecule of that gas in every 1 billion molecules of air. Some halogenated gases are considered major greenhouse gases due to their very high global warming potentials and long atmospheric lifetimes even if they only exist at a few ppt ( ). This indicator looks at global average levels of ozone in both the stratosphere and troposphere. For trends in ground-level ozone concentrations within the United States, see EPA’s   at:  . Ozone is also a greenhouse gas, but it differs from other greenhouse gases in several ways. The effects of ozone depend on its altitude, or where the gas is located vertically in the atmosphere. Most ozone naturally exists in the layer of the atmosphere called the stratosphere, which ranges from approximately 6 to 30 miles above the Earth’s surface. Ozone in the stratosphere has a slight net warming effect on the planet, but it is good for life on Earth because it absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, preventing it from reaching the Earth’s surface. In the troposphere—the layer of the atmosphere near ground level—ozone is an air pollutant that is harmful to breathe, a main ingredient of urban smog, and an important greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change (see the   indicator). Unlike the other major greenhouse gases, tropospheric ozone only lasts for days to weeks, so levels often vary by location and by season.  This indicator describes concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It focuses on the major greenhouse gases that result from human activities. For carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and halogenated gases, recent measurements come from monitoring stations around the world, while measurements of older air come from air bubbles trapped in layers of ice from Antarctica and Greenland. By determining the age of the ice layers and the concentrations of gases trapped inside, scientists can learn what the atmosphere was like thousands of years ago. This indicator also shows data from satellite instruments that measure ozone density in the troposphere, the stratosphere, and the “total column,” or all layers of the atmosphere. These satellite data are routinely compared with ground-based instruments to confirm their accuracy. Ozone data have been averaged worldwide for each year to smooth out the regional and seasonal variations.  This indicator includes several of the most important halogenated gases, but some others are not shown. Many other halogenated gases are also greenhouse gases, but Figure 4 is limited to a set of common examples that represent most of the major types of these gases. The indicator also does not address certain other pollutants that can affect climate by either reflecting or absorbing energy. For example, sulfate particles can reflect sunlight away from the Earth, while black carbon aerosols (soot) absorb energy. Data for nitrogen trifluoride (Figure 4) reflect modeled averages based on measurements made in the Northern Hemisphere and some locations in the Southern Hemisphere, to represent global average concentrations over time. The global averages for ozone only cover the area between 50°N and 50°S latitude (77 percent of the Earth’s surface), because at higher latitudes the lack of sunlight in winter creates data gaps and the angle of incoming sunlight during the rest of the year reduces the accuracy of the satellite measuring technique. Global atmospheric concentration measurements for carbon dioxide (Figure 1), methane (Figure 2), and nitrous oxide (Figure 3) come from a variety of monitoring programs and studies published in peer-reviewed literature. Global atmospheric concentration data for selected halogenated gases (Figure 4) were compiled by the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A similar figure with many of these gases appears in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report.  Satellite measurements of ozone were processed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and validated using ground-based measurements collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \n"},

This indicator measures the “radiative forcing” or heating effect caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This figure shows the amount of radiative forcing caused by various greenhouse gases, based on the change in concentration of these gases in the Earth’s atmosphere since 1750. Radiative forcing is calculated in watts per square meter, which represents the size of the energy imbalance in the atmosphere. On the right side of the graph, radiative forcing has been converted to the Annual Greenhouse Gas Index, which is set to a value of 1.0 for 1990. Data source: NOAA, 2020 \n This figure shows the total amount of radiative forcing caused by human activities—including indirect effects—between 1750 and 2011. Radiative forcing is calculated in watts per square meter, which represents the size of the energy imbalance in the atmosphere. Each colored bar represents scientists’ best estimate, while the thin black bars indicate the likely range of possibilities. The natural change in the energy received from the sun over this time period is provided for reference. Data source: IPCC, 2013 \n When energy from the sun reaches the Earth, the planet absorbs some of this energy and radiates the rest back to space as heat. The Earth’s surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and outgoing energy. Average conditions tend to remain stable unless the Earth experiences a force that shifts the energy balance. A shift in the energy balance causes the Earth’s average temperature to become warmer or cooler, leading to a variety of other changes in the lower atmosphere, on land, and in the oceans. A variety of physical and chemical changes can affect the global energy balance and force changes in the Earth’s climate. Some of these changes are natural, while others are influenced by humans. These changes are measured by the amount of warming or cooling they can produce, which is called “radiative forcing.” Changes that have a warming effect are called “positive” forcing, while changes that have a cooling effect are called “negative” forcing. When positive and negative forces are out of balance, the result is a change in the Earth’s average surface temperature. Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere affect radiative forcing (see the   indicator). Greenhouse gases absorb energy that radiates upward from the Earth’s surface, re-emitting heat to the lower atmosphere and warming the Earth’s surface. Human activities have led to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases that can remain in the atmosphere for decades, centuries, or longer, so the corresponding warming effects will last for a long time.  Figure 1 of this indicator measures the average total radiative forcing of 20 long-lived greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The results were calculated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) based on measured concentrations of the gases in the atmosphere, compared with the concentrations that were present around 1750, before the Industrial Revolution began. Because each gas has a different ability to absorb and emit energy, this indicator converts the changes in greenhouse gas concentrations into a measure of the total radiative forcing (warming effect) caused by each gas. Radiative forcing is calculated in watts per square meter, which represents the size of the energy imbalance in the atmosphere. NOAA also translates the total radiative forcing of these measured gases into an index value called the Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (right side of Figure 1). This number compares the radiative forcing for a particular year with the radiative forcing in 1990, which is a common baseline year for global agreements to track and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For reference, this indicator also presents an estimate of the total radiative forcing associated with a variety of human activities from 1750 to the present. Figure 2 shows the influence of: The index in Figure 1 does not include short-lived greenhouse gases like tropospheric ozone, reflective aerosol particles, black carbon (soot), or the indirect influence of methane through its effects on water vapor and ozone formation. Figure 2 includes these and other indirect influences. Data for Figure 1 were provided by NOAA. This figure and other information are available at:  . Data for Figure 2 came from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), which publishes assessment reports based on the best available climate science data. "},

This indicator describes emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States. This figure shows emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and several fluorinated gases in the United States from 1990 to 2022. For consistency, emissions are expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. Data source: U.S. EPA, 2024 \n This figure shows greenhouse gas emissions and sinks (negative values) by source in the United States from 1990 to 2022. For consistency, emissions are expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. All electric power emissions are grouped together in the “Electric power” sector, so other sectors such as “Residential” and “Commercial” are only showing non-electric sources, such as burning oil or gas for heating. Totals do not match Figure 1 exactly because the economic sectors shown here do not include emissions from U.S. territories outside the 50 states. Data source: U.S. EPA, 2024 \n This figure shows trends in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2022 per capita (heavy orange line), based on the total U.S. population (thin orange line). It also shows trends in emissions per dollar of real GDP (heavy blue line). Real GDP (thin blue line) is the value of all goods and services produced in the country during a given year, adjusted for inflation. All data are indexed to 1990 as the base year, which is assigned a value of 100. For instance, a real GDP value of 217 in the year 2022 would represent a 117 percent increase since 1990. Data source: U.S. EPA, 2024 \n A number of factors influence the quantities of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, including economic activity, population, consumption patterns, energy prices, land use, and technology. There are several ways to track these emissions, such as by measuring emissions directly, calculating emissions based on the amount of fuel that people burn, and estimating other activities and their associated emissions. EPA has two key programs that provide data on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States: the   and the  . See “ ” to learn more about these programs. This indicator focuses on emissions and removals of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and several fluorinated gases—all important greenhouse gases that are influenced by human activities. These particular gases are covered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the more recent Paris Agreement, which are international agreements that require participating countries to develop and regularly submit an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. Data and analysis for this indicator come from EPA’s annual inventory submission, the  .  This indicator is restricted to emissions and removals associated with human activities. It starts in 1990, which is a common base year for global agreements to track and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Each greenhouse gas has a different lifetime (how long it stays in the atmosphere) and a different ability to trap heat in our atmosphere. To allow different gases to be compared and added together, emissions are converted into carbon dioxide equivalents. This step uses each gas’s 100-year global warming potential, which measures how much a given amount of the gas is estimated to contribute to global warming over a period of 100 years after being emitted. Carbon dioxide is assigned a global warming potential equal to 1. This analysis uses global warming potentials from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) Fifth Assessment Report. In that report, methane has a global warming potential of 28, which means a ton of methane emissions contributes 28 times as much warming as a ton of carbon dioxide emissions over 100 years, and that ton of methane emissions is therefore equal to 28 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. For additional perspective, this indicator also shows greenhouse gas emissions in relation to economic output and population. While this indicator includes the major greenhouse gases emitted by human activities, it does not include other greenhouse gases and substances that are not covered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement but that still affect the Earth’s energy balance and climate (see the   indicator for more details). For example, this indicator excludes ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which have high global warming potentials, as these gases have been or are currently being phased out under an international agreement called the Montreal Protocol. This indicator also excludes black carbon and aerosols, which most greenhouse gas emissions inventories do not cover. While there are many natural greenhouse gas emissions sources, this indicator focuses on emissions that are associated with human activities—those that are most responsible for the observed buildup of these gases in our atmosphere. Although the land use, land-use change, and forestry emission estimates include emissions and sinks from unmanaged lands due to forest growth, fires, and other factors, this indicator does not include other natural sources such as methane emissions from unmanaged wetlands. Data for this indicator came from EPA’s  . This report is available online at:  . The calculations in Figure 3 are based on GDP and population data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census, respectively.  "},

For consistency, emissions are expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. These totals include emissions and sinks due to land-use change and forestry. Data source: Climate Watch, 2023 \n This figure shows worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by sector from 1990 to 2015. For consistency, emissions are expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. These totals include emissions and sinks due to land-use change and forestry. Note that the sectors shown here are different from the economic sectors used in U.S. emissions accounting (see the   indicator). Emissions from international transport (aviation and marine) are separate from the energy sector because they are not part of individual countries’ emissions inventories. The energy sector includes all other transportation activities. Data source: Climate Watch, 2023 \n This figure shows carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 to 2020 for different regions of the world. These totals do not include emissions or sinks related to land-use change or forestry. Inclusion of land-use change and forestry would increase the apparent emissions from some regions while decreasing the emissions from others. Data source: Climate Watch, 2023 \n Increasing emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activities worldwide, especially burning of fossil fuels, have led to a substantial increase in atmospheric concentrations of long-lived and other greenhouse gases (see the   indicator). Every country around the world emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, meaning the root cause of climate change is truly global in scope. Some countries produce far more greenhouse gases than others, and several factors—such as economic activity (including the composition and efficiency of the economy), population, income level, land use, and climatic conditions—can influence a country’s emissions levels. Tracking greenhouse gas emissions worldwide provides a global context for understanding the United States’ and other nations’ roles in climate change. Like the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions indicator, this indicator focuses on emissions of gases covered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and several fluorinated gases. These are all important greenhouse gases that are influenced by human activities, and the Convention requires participating countries to develop and periodically submit an inventory of these emissions. Data and analysis for this indicator come from Climate Watch, which is managed by the World Resources Institute. Climate Watch compiles data from peer-reviewed and internationally recognized greenhouse gas inventories developed by EPA and other government agencies worldwide. Global estimates for carbon dioxide are published annually, but estimates for other gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, are available only every fifth year. Climate Watch includes estimates of emissions and sinks associated with land use and forestry activities, which come from global estimates compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Each greenhouse gas has a different lifetime (how long it stays in the atmosphere) and a different ability to trap heat in our atmosphere. To allow different gases to be compared and added together, emissions are converted into carbon dioxide equivalents. This step uses each gas’s 100-year global warming potential, which measures how much a given amount of the gas is estimated to contribute to global warming over a period of 100 years after being emitted. Carbon dioxide is assigned a global warming potential equal to 1. This analysis uses global warming potentials from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) Fourth Assessment Report. In that report, methane has a global warming potential of 25, which means a ton of methane emissions contributes 25 times as much warming as a ton of carbon dioxide emissions over 100 years, and that ton of methane emissions is therefore equal to 25 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. See   for global warming potentials from IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report. Like the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions indicator, this indicator does not include emissions of gases that affect climate but are not covered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. For example, this indicator excludes ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which have high global warming potentials, because these gases have been or are currently being phased out under an international agreement called the Montreal Protocol. This indicator also excludes black carbon and aerosols, which most emissions inventories do not cover. There are also various emissions of greenhouse gases of natural origin, which this indicator does not cover. Global emissions inventories for gases other than carbon dioxide are limited to five-year intervals. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change database has more comprehensive data; however, these data are available mainly for a group of mostly developed countries that account for only about half of global greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, to provide a more representative measure of global greenhouse gas emissions, this indicator uses the broader Climate Watch database. Data for this indicator came from the World Resources Institute’s Climate Watch database, which is accessible online at:  . The Climate Watch dataset consists of data that were originally collected by organizations including the International Energy Agency, EPA, the U.S. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Greenhouse gases from human activities are the most significant driver of observed climate change since the mid-20th century.  The indicators in this chapter characterize emissions of the major greenhouse gases resulting from human activities, the concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere, and how emissions and concentrations have changed over time. When comparing emissions of different gases, these indicators use a concept called “global warming potential” to convert amounts of other gases into carbon dioxide equivalents. As greenhouse gas emissions from human activities increase, they build up in the atmosphere and warm the climate, leading to many other changes around the world—in the atmosphere, on land, and in the oceans. The indicators in other chapters of this report illustrate many of these changes, which have both positive and negative effects on people, society, and the environment—including plants and animals. Because many of the major greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for tens to hundreds of years after being released, their warming effects on the climate persist over a long time and can therefore affect both present and future generations. See   to learn more about the numbers in the table above and the versions EPA uses for various calculations.   EPA has two key programs that provide data on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States: the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks and the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The programs are complementary, providing both a higher-level perspective on the nation’s total emissions and detailed information about the sources and types of emissions from individual facilities. The data in EPA’s U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions indicator come from the national inventory. EPA develops an annual report called the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (or the GHG Inventory). This report tracks trends in total annual U.S. emissions by source (or sink), economic sector, and greenhouse gas going back to 1990. EPA uses national energy data, data on national agricultural activities, and other national statistics to provide a comprehensive accounting of total greenhouse gas emissions for all man-made sources in the United States. This inventory fulfills the nation’s obligation to provide an annual emissions report under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  using interactive tools. Since 2010, EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has been collecting annual emissions data from industrial sources that directly emit large amounts of greenhouse gases. Generally, facilities that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year are required to report. The program also collects data from entities known as \"suppliers\" that supply certain fossil fuels and industrial gases that will emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere if burned or released—for example, refineries that supply petroleum products such as gasoline. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program only requires reporting; it is not an emissions control program. This program helps EPA and the public understand where greenhouse gas emissions are coming from, and will improve our ability to make informed policy, business, and regulatory decisions. Learn more about the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and   by facility, industry, location, or gas using a data visualization and mapping tool called  .

Water quality trading (WQT) under the Clean Water Act (CWA) is an option for compliance with effluent limitations in a NPDES permit. Water quality trading can provide greater flexibility on the timing and level of technology a facility might install, reduce overall compliance costs, and encourage voluntary participation of non-point sources within the watershed. Trading can provide ancillary environmental benefits such as carbon sinks, flood retention, riparian improvement, and habitat. Pollutant sources in a watershed may face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Under trading programs, facilities with NPDES permitted discharges facing higher pollution control costs may be able to meet their regulatory obligations by purchasing environmentally equivalent (or superior) pollution reductions from another source at lower cost. Trading can produce substantial cost savings while meeting the same water quality goal. It may also offer greater flexibility on the timing and level of technology a facility might install. Trading can provide ancillary environmental benefits such as flood retention, riparian improvement, and habitat. A permitted facility or a point source might trade with another point source or with a nonpoint source. The partners might trade directly, or through a third party. Any party might act as champion for a trading program. Trading works best when all stakeholders interested in their local watershed including permit holders, conservation organizations and watershed groups are involved in the development of the trading program. A credit is a unit of pollutant reduction usually measured in pounds equivalent. Credits can be generated by a point source over-controlling its discharge or by a nonpoint source installing best management practices (BMPs) that are different than or in addition to its baseline. On February 6, 2019, EPA issued “ ” (2019 Memorandum). The 2019 Memorandum reiterates EPA’s strong support for water quality trading; promotes the adoption of market-based programs to incentivize the implementation of technologies and practices to reduce nonpoint source pollution; provides additional guidance and policy options to stakeholders for developing and implementing market-based programs; and promotes increased investment in conservation actions. To achieve these goals, the 2019 Memorandum identified six market-based principles: EPA's policy supports trading of nutrients (e.g., total phosphorus, total nitrogen), sediment load reductions, temperature, and other pollutants. EPA supports trading in unimpaired waters to maintain water quality standards as well as in impaired waters. EPA supports both pre-TMDL trading and trading under a TMDL. Trading scenarios include point source-point source trades, point source-nonpoint source trades, pretreatment trades, and intra-plant trades. EPA does not support trading that results in an impairment of an existing or designated use, adversely affect drinking water systems, or exceeds a cap established under a TMDL. Baselines are the limits or expectations that would apply absent trading. These operate as the basis for credit calculation. A buyer’s baseline would be the effluent limits in its NPDES permit, and in a trading scenario, it can purchase credits to achieve that limit. The baseline for a point source seller is its most stringent effluent limitation. A point source seller generates credits when it reduces its discharge below its baseline. On September 5, 2019, EPA requested public comments on options for providing additional flexibilities for baselines for nonpoint sources in watersheds with EPA established or approved Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). Trading might occur directly between two or more point sources or through an exchange. Trading might also occur between a point source and a nonpoint source, either directly or through an exchange. A credit exchange is where a third party such as a person, organization, or website, facilitates trading. Another unique feature a credit exchange might include is a reserve of credits held in case of failed trades. These are the basic trading scenarios; others may exist."},

EPA is researching new and existing alternative water source practices as a way to meet the growing demand for sufficient quantities of high-quality water and to address water scarcity. These opportunities include limiting discharges from wastewater treatment; identifying alternative water sources; recovering water resources; developing methods to enhance the availability and quality of recycled water; and creating tools that aid decision-making for fit-for-purpose water reuse. EPA published the   in 2012 as a general reference for water reuse practices, and the   in 2017 to inform current practices in the rapidly developing area of direct potable reuse. EPA’s research aims to advance the scientific understanding of water reuse to improve the quantity of high-quality water without creating other significant environmental impacts. EPA research focuses on potable and non-potable fit-for-purpose water reuse for small, decentralized systems in multiple areas. These general research areas explore testing treatments on alternative water sources; creating operational water reuse practices; and developing tools to inform community decisions. One area to supplement water resources that requires more research is defining treatment requirements for the safe use of alternative waters for a variety of end uses based on fit-for-purpose risk characterization. In the context of this webpage, fit-for-purpose specifications are the treatment requirements needed to bring water from a particular source to the quality standard to ensure public health, environmental protection, or specific user needs. To prepare for broader implementation of water reuse practices nationwide, it is essential to identify chemicals of emerging concern and microbial contaminants during the assessment of alternative water sources. EPA research may produce information and tools to help communities adapt their water systems to a changing climate. This includes assessments to determine and minimize the impacts of the alternative source waters use in existing drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a complex class of chemicals that historically have been used in industry and consumer products and continue to be widely used today. PFAS can be persistent in the environment and the human body. PFAS contamination of water is a significant issue in the United States and a high priority for the EPA.  EPA research on PFAS in water sources focuses on developing tools for evaluating and managing risks from PFAS, such as the development of analytical methods for measuring occurrence; drinking water and wastewater treatment approaches for removal; residual stream treatment and management; and identifying and characterizing  PFAS sources to design treatment management approaches. EPA has a range of research on PFAS that is not limited to water resources. For more information about all of EPA's PFAS research, please visit   or  . EPA’s research includes the development of analytical methods for measuring large groups of PFAS in water and water-related samples. Total organic fluorine and total oxidizable precursors are analytical methods that help researchers determine whether a PFAS might be present by looking at certain components and precursors of PFAS. Traditional targeted methods require researchers to know what chemicals they are looking for, which can be time consuming and labor intensive. Scientists are building on existing analytical methods and also developing   used to analyze and characterize thousands of unknown and new PFAS. . Today, researchers can rapidly characterize thousands of never studied chemical compounds in a wide variety of environmental, residential, and biological media. This approach is called non-targeted analysis.  . EPA’s research on drinking water treatment technologies for PFAS focuses on collecting existing treatment data from the literature and combining it with results from additional laboratory studies on PFAS removal. These studies use a wide variety of technologies, including granular activated carbon, ion exchange, and membranes. EPA researchers evaluate, model, and optimize treatment technologies, including treatment at the water treatment plant and at the point of use, such as a faucet. EPA’s research is conducted at multiple scales, including benchtop studies in the laboratory, pilot-scale studies both in the laboratory and in the field, and full-scale treatment studies at municipal drinking water treatment plants. EPA research focuses on a range of drinking water system sizes, such as drinking water systems serving large cities with populations of more than 10,000 people, to very small communities with populations of less than 100 people that may use point-of-use or point-of-entry systems. Research focuses on issues that impact systems with technical, financial, and managerial capability limitations. To help homeowners make an informed decision when trying to reduce PFAS in their drinking water, EPA researchers conducted studies on several off-the-shelf, commercially available technologies, including granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange treatment systems to determine if they were capable of reducing PFAS levels in drinking water.   and how different filtration systems fared. Possible PFAS sources in water can include industrial and hospital wastewater, landfill leachate, or washing facilities. Knowing the sources of PFAS in water resources is critical for developing cost-effective approaches to managing PFAS contamination. EPA’s research focuses on building and improving models to predict the fate and transport of PFAS in water, assess exposure pathways and risks, and identify and characterize PFAS sources and concentrations. Researchers apply these models and analyses to reduce possible exposures to PFAS and improve treatment technologies. PFAS is difficult to treat in water and requires effective and economical solutions. This research focuses on the development and advancement of cost-effective, high-efficiency processes to remove PFAS from wastewater, stormwater, industrial and process wastes, leachates, biosolids, and residual streams. PFAS molecules are made up of a chain of linked carbon and fluorine atoms. Thanks to recent trials, EPA researchers may have found an effective method of breaking this chain link of carbon and fluorine to destroy PFAS—called Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO).  ."},

To support the efforts government agencies with assisting small systems, EPA's Office of Research and Development and Office of Water, in partnership with the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA), has held an annual drinking water workshop for over 20 years to provide timely technical and regulatory information relevant to small systems. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, a system is considered small if it serves 10,000 or fewer people. When the first workshop was held in 2004, it was by invitation only and designed as an educational opportunity for state staff working with small communities to install arsenic treatment technologies. In 2008, at the encouragement of state agencies, the workshop was opened to the public and expanded to include small drinking water system distribution, water quality, source water, treatment, and operations topics. Beginning in 2024, the workshop is designed for EPA; ASDWA; and Tribal, state, and territory personnel responsible for drinking water regulations compliance and treatment technologies permitting (primacy agencies). Focusing on the most pressing challenges facing small systems, the workshops provide current information, resources, training, and networking opportunities needed to help in building systems capacity and sustainably and with providing equitable access to drinking water.

In direct support of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) funding authorized by Congress through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021,  , EPA researchers at the Office of Research and Development (ORD) will be providing small and/or disadvantaged communities with drinking water technical assistance related to lead service lines identification and treatment for emerging contaminants. Technical assistance: Emerging contaminants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are challenging to drinking water systems across the country. Treatment for emerging contaminants is often not known, and when it is known, can be extremely costly. It is important to develop treatment options to ensure public health protection. EPA researchers are working with public, private, and Tribal owned water systems across the country through a BIL-funded technical assistance program. This program is available to help local water systems identify optimal treatment methods for removing emerging contaminants, including PFAS, and optimize the long-term operation of the chosen technology. It will also be used to develop best practice guides and performance/cost estimate tools so water utilities across the nation can make informed treatment and operational choices. Technical assistance connects these water systems with EPA experts directly. It is estimated that there are approximately 6 to 10 million homes with lead service lines in the United States. Service lines are pipes that connect a home or building to the drinking water main. When these pipes are made from lead, they are referred to as lead service lines. The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) prohibited the installation of lead service lines, but there are still many homes and businesses with lead service lines installed prior to 1986. Knowing where a community may have lead service lines is critical to develop a replacement program. EPA researchers will be working with multiple communities across the U.S. to conduct research on the best approaches to lead service line identification (LSLID). The results of this research will be used to develop best practices and tools that drinking water systems can use to minimize cost and improve their ability to identify and remove lead service lines more easily. .

Sources of public drinking water come from can come from groundwater and surface waters, including aquifers, springs, streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Protecting source water can reduce risks by preventing exposures to contaminated water. EPA researchers are exploring interventions to prevent and mitigate source water pollutants, including those associated with harmful algal blooms wildfire, and pathogens. EPA is also focusing on developing tools and resources for communities to support their decision making regarding alternative sources of water, such as water reuse. Make faster decisions related to cyanobacterial algal blooms with the  , which provides satellite data for over 2,000 lakes and reservoirs across the United States. Algal toxins from harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasingly contaminating sources waters, as well as the drinking water treatment facilities that the waters supply. Algal toxins, including cyanotoxins, can enter drinking water supplies as a result of the growth of HABs in surface water sources or groundwater sources under the direct influence of surface water. The management of HABs is first dependent on the ability to identify source waters and associated drinking water treatment systems that are vulnerable to blooms. Then, interventions need to be applied at points from the source water to water distribution. EPA researchers are investigating the efficacy of different interventions to mitigate HAB development in source waters and algal toxin-related risk from impacted source waters. Wildfire can impact drinking source water through increased sedimentation and mobilization of nutrients, heavy metals, and other pollutants. These effects may require that drinking water utilities adapt their treatment processes to account for these changes, which may, in turn, result in elevated concentrations of contaminants, including nitrate and disinfection byproducts (DBPs) post-treatment. Modeling and decision support tools can help explore treatability and adaptation strategies for these impacted systems. Research is critical to better understand how fires affect water quality, drinking water sources, and the overall health of an ecosystem. EPA researchers and EPA grantee award recipients are investigating the impacts of wildfire to source water quality and water infrastructure.

Research techniques utilize modeling, data analytics, and management tools, as well as analytical, geospatial, and commercially available sensor data to assess system conditions, hydraulics, water quality, and resilience from source water to the consumer’s tap. Drinking water distribution systems are large, complex, and unique ecosystems. Proper management is critical to delivering safe water and maintaining the public health of a community. In storage tanks and on pipe walls, contaminants can accumulate, biofilm can multiply, iron materials can corrode, and other infrastructure components can weaken, deteriorate, and form leaks. Contaminants can also propagate and accumulate in premise plumbing systems within homes and buildings. All of these make it harder to maintain disinfectant residuals and water quality from the treatment plant to the tap.  EPA research is addressing multiple approaches to maintaining water quality and building the resilience and reliability of distribution systems, including monitoring, modeling, booster disinfection, optimization of tank operations, and replacing/repairing infrastructure. Much of the focus is on developing and evaluating approaches that are affordable and practical for small and/or vulnerable communities. Distribution system corrosion occurs when the pipes that carry treated drinking water are gradually worn away by a chemical reaction between water and the metal surface (pipe wall or solder). A number of factors can be involved in the extent to which metal pipes corrode, including the chemistry of the water (acidity and alkalinity), and the types and amounts of minerals in the water, temperature of the water, the amount of wear in the pipes and how long the water stays in pipes, and the presence of protective scales or coatings inside the pipes. This corrosion can result in metal release, such as lead and copper, into the water if pipes are not protected. It can also cause reaction with disinfectants used to treat for microbial contaminants, which can result in disinfection byproducts and increased pathogen growth. Effective corrosion control can reduce these concerns and also decreases the risk of costly infrastructure repairs or replacement. EPA researchers are expanding scientific understanding of corrosion concerns and developing resources and tools to assist water systems. Corrosion and solubility play major roles in controlling the release of lead and copper from lead service lines and other plumbing materials into drinking water. Key water quality parameters, such as pH, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon, disinfectants, and corrosion inhibitors, interact with lead and copper materials in complex ways that can result in corrosion and release into drinking water sources. Lead that is released into drinking water supplies can pose serious risks to public health, especially to children. The release of copper from distribution materials can lead to excessive localized or pitting corrosion, which is typically not associated with elevated copper levels or regulatory considerations but can be a major financial burden as well as an inconvenience to homeowners. Corroding metals and associated corrosion products in finished water can react with disinfectants, causing areas of low disinfectant residual in the distribution system. Low disinfectant residual can increase the potential for microbial growth, including the growth of opportunistic pathogens. Effective corrosion control treatment and distribution system maintenance can allow for better control of microbial growth. EPA researchers are expanding scientific understanding of corrosion concerns and developing resources and tools for characterizing and mitigating lead and copper in drinking water distribution systems and premise plumbing.

Disasters, whether human-made or naturally occurring, can impact the ability of drinking water utilities to function, including the potential disruption of drinking water supplies to municipalities. Water systems, including water treatment and distribution systems, are a critical infrastructure system and require increased protection and the ability for utilities to detect, respond to, and recover from physical and cyber threats and attacks. Water system managers need to know when their treatment systems, pumps, valves, tanks, etc. are being compromised, how to stop an attack, and how to recover so that safe and full service can be returned to the community. EPA researchers are conducting studies and developing modeling tools and technologies that aid the design and operation of drinking water systems in a way that decreases their vulnerability to disasters. This research is contributing to a resilient water sector, with tools and methodologies to respond to drinking water and source water contamination incidents and minimize the time that these systems are offline. Water systems, including water treatment and distribution systems, are considered one of the nation’s critical infrastructures. Critical infrastructure requires increased protection and the ability for utilities to detect, respond to, and recover from physical and cyber threats and attacks. Water system managers need to know when their treatment systems, pumps, valves, tanks, etc. are being compromised, how to stop an attack, and how to recover so that safe and full service can be returned to the community. Resilient water infrastructure systems can facilitate quick and effective decision making during emergency situations, including cyberattacks, to ensure access to adequate water capacity and quality. In partnership with the Department of Homeland Security, water utilities, and private sector, EPA researchers will be demonstrating and documenting the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities on internet-facing operating technology process control systems. This work can inform and evaluate utility response or mitigation actions that could counter or prevent the impacts of a cyberattack. Ultimately, the impact of this work will be a water sector with the tools and methodologies needed to prevent or mitigate high impact cyberattacks on both physical and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure. EPA also led a steering committee of water industry experts to develop the capability to evaluate and test cybersecurity equipment for the protection of water system infrastructure. Research to improve the cyber security of water utilities is carried out at the EPA   located at the Department of Energy Idaho National Laboratory. Watch the recording of the   (August 29, 2023). This webinar includes information on tools and resources to help small systems build cyber resilience and provides an overview of EPA's water distribution system operational technology cybersecurity research at the Water Security Test Bed. EPA research furthers the understanding of contaminants’ movement and persistence in drinking water systems to inform decision making regarding detection, decontamination, waste management, and operational countermeasures. Most drinking water utilities use commercially available water quality sensors to monitor for changes in water quality indicators. These indicators may include pH, levels of free or total chlorine, and total organic carbon.  EPA has tested commonly used sensors to learn if they can detect water contaminated with these chemical, biological, or radiological agents, in addition to detecting routine water quality variations. Research focuses on novel detection technologies that are new to the market, and technologies that could detect contamination in source water, such as reservoirs. Intentional or unintentional contamination of a drinking water distribution system can affect human health and result in high costs to return the water system to service. Many contaminants, whether they are chemical, biological, or radiological, can adhere to or become embedded in rusty or corroded pipes or in biologically active layers (biofilm) on the pipe walls. EPA researchers examine techniques to clean, or decontaminate, contaminated water infrastructure including, pipes, valves and tanks. Following an emergency event, communities need access to clean water not only for drinking but also for cooking, cleaning, and medical triage. EPA is researching decision support tools to help decision makers balance the many factors that go into the design and implementation of a treatment system at their site. Learn more about  ."},

EPA research is advancing innovative and sustainable technologies and processes for addressing immediate and emerging chemical and biological contaminants of concern, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), lead, algal toxins, disinfection byproducts, and opportunistic pathogens. This research is also advancing the development and evaluation of effective and low-cost treatment technologies for small systems and overburdened communities. Chemical contaminants (inorganic and organic) in drinking water are elements or compounds that may be naturally occurring, such as metals and algal toxins, or human made, such as PFAS and pharmaceuticals. EPA’s drinking water research is addressing a wide range of chemical contaminants of emerging concern.  |   |   |   |   |  Lead and copper enter drinking water primarily through plumbing materials that contain them, especially where the water has high acidity or low mineral content that corrodes pipes and fixtures. The most common sources of lead in drinking water are lead pipes, faucets, and fixtures. In homes with lead pipes that connect the home to the water main, also known as lead services lines, these pipes are typically the most significant source of lead in the water. Lead pipes are more likely to be found in older cities and homes built before 1986. Among homes without lead service lines, the most common problem is with leaded brass components in chrome-plated faucets and plumbing with lead solder. EPA’s lead and copper research focuses on source identification and relative source contributions, lead service line identification, sampling approaches, and will improve models for estimating lead exposure and mobility.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( ) contamination of water is a significant issue in the United States and a high priority for the Agency. PFAS are a complex class of chemicals, some of which are persistent in the environment and human body. EPA’s research in the Office of Research and Development includes scientific support of regulatory and rulemaking efforts regarding PFAS in drinking water.  (June 27, 2023) Learn about how EPA researchers are providing communities, including small and/or disadvantaged, with technical assistance in support of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) to assist with cost-effective treatment options for emerging contaminants, including PFAS. Algal toxins from harmful   (HABs)are a growing risk for source water contamination, as well as the drinking water treatment facilities that the source waters supply. These treatment facilities face a difficult task of not only removing the toxins, but doing so in a safe and cost-effective way. EPA's researchers are helping communities by providing the science needed to confront this challenge. EPA is investigating innovative methods for nitrate reduction, including bench-scale experiments on the reduction of nitrate by sulfur, a process that can reduce the need for chemical handling among small drinking water systems. Researchers are also investigating an anaerobic biological denitrification pilot system. Initial research demonstrates that these innovative methods achieve good nitrate removal and have important operational benefits as compared to existing drinking water denitrification systems, such as less frequent backwashing and reduced chemical costs, and show promise for small community applications. EPA researchers are investigating biological treatment of drinking water for manganese, ammonia, arsenic, and iron. Researchers are conducting a pilot-scale biological treatment study for manganese removal, a pilot-scale biological treatment study for ammonia removal, and studying the biological treatment of arsenic. One of the major potential advantages of biological treatment processes is the minimal need for chemical handling and processes oversight. These advantages in turn make the process potentially advantageous for use in small drinking water treatment systems. EPA researchers are also investigating arsenic accumulation and its release from old cast iron water mains into water distribution systems, leading to arsenic levels above allowable limits and threats to consumer health. Research includes surveys of arsenic drinking water throughout the United States and testing the addition of orthophosphate to drinking water as a method to reduce arsenic release. Balancing residual disinfectant levels in distribution systems remains a challenge to control pathogens without forming unacceptable levels of harmful byproducts from the disinfectants. EPA researchers are studying effective control of   (DBPs) in distribution and premise plumbing systems, while still effectively reducing opportunistic pathogens, such as . Through the use of bench-scale and computer-simulated approaches, EPA scientists and engineers are evaluating effective disinfectant concentrations to treat these pathogens while minimizing DBPs. Additionally, researchers are studying the relationships between health risks associated with DBPs,   residuals, pathogen occurrence, and corrosion control of distribution systems and premise plumbing. Also see   on this page. In drinking water, microbial contaminants (also referred to as biological contaminants) are microorganisms that act as  . Opportunistic pathogens, like  , continue to be one of the leading causes of drinking water related disease outbreaks. Other pathogens, including a wide variety of bacteria, protozoans, and viruses, also pose significant human health risks. Current treatments of pathogens include the use of disinfectants, such as chlorine and monochloramine, ultraviolet treatment, and filtration. To control and minimize the presence of these organisms, sufficient disinfectant residuals need to be maintained in the drinking water distribution system. In addition, systems need to balance the management of pathogens while minimizing the risk posed by the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Small- to medium-sized drinking water systems may have limited resources and expertise to evaluate and install innovative technologies. EPA research aims to help these utilities optimize disinfection practices and manage water quality throughout the drinking water system to reduce opportunistic and other pathogens. Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are chemicals that have not previously been detected in water or are being detected at significantly different levels than expected. These include a wide array of potential pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), surfactants, microorganisms, microplastics, and endocrine disrupting chemicals, among others. Factors such as shrinking water and financial resources, climate change, agricultural runoff, harmful algal blooms (HABs), and industrial land use can increase the probability of CECs found in drinking water. This issue is likely to disproportionately affect small drinking water systems due to limited resources and treatment options, among other factors. These unregulated contaminants can also occur in wastewater, reused water, or other sources and a comprehensive understanding of the risk posed by these potential pollutants is needed. CECs can be difficult to measure and can be linked to many current or historic sources. EPA’s research investigates analytical methods, occurrence, health effects, and treatment assessments to aid decision making to ensure that these CECs are at safe levels in drinking water, wastewater, and reused water. There are over 145,000 active public drinking water systems in the United States. Of these, 95% are considered small systems under the Safe Drinking Water Act, meaning they serve 10,000 or fewer people. While many of these active small systems consistently provide safe, reliable drinking water to their customers, many face a number of challenges in their ability to achieve and maintain system sustainability. Some of these small system challenges include lack of expertise to choose, operate, and maintain systems; lack of financial resources; aging infrastructure and limited options for residual disposal. EPA researchers are developing tools, technologies, and approaches to help small systems lower costs and provide safe drinking water now and in the future. There is the possibility that some drinking water systems may be affected by natural disasters, security incidents, or high levels of contaminants in the source where the drinking water comes from. On-site water treatment systems for contaminant incident responses need to be compatible with potentially enormous volumes of contaminated water. Evaluation of mobile, on-site emergency water treatment systems involves consideration of transportation issues, deployment, operation, cost and effectiveness for treating a wide variety of contaminants and concentrations. EPA is researching decision support tools to help decision makers balance the many factors that go into the design and implementation of a treatment system at their site. Part of this process could be containing the contaminated water locally so that it can be treated without the potential of releasing the contaminated water to the environment. Because these potential water volumes involved can be technically challenging, EPA is researching innovative approaches that would use locally available equipment and assets. Following an emergency event, communities need access to clean drinking water. EPA researchers partnered with a nonprofit to develop a modular, mobile water treatment system known as Water on Wheels–Emergency Mobile Water Treatment System (WOW Cart). The WOW Cart is an inexpensive and versatile water treatment system configured with multiple treatment technologies and equipped with alternative power sources. It's easy to operate and can be deployed to critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, ahead of oncoming natural events."},

Biofuels are derived from renewable biological materials such as ethanol from corn starch, corn stover, perennial grasses, woody biomass, and algae, and diesel from soybeans. Currently available biofuels are made from sugar crops (sugarcane, sugarbeet); starch crops (corn, potatoes); oilseed crops (soybean, sunflower, rapeseed); and animal fats. Sugar and starch crops are converted through a fermentation process to form bioalcohols, including ethanol (the most widely used), butanol, and propanol. Oils and animal fats can be processed into biodiesel. Most vehicles built after 2000 can use gasoline-ethanol blends containing up to 15% ethanol (by volume). Currently there are about 3,500 fueling stations in the U.S. that offer E-85 fuel, most of which are in the upper Midwest. Replacing fossil fuels with biofuels has the potential to reduce some undesirable environmental impacts of fossil fuel production and use, including conventional and greenhouse gas (GHG) pollutant emissions, exhaustible resource depletion, and dependence on unstable foreign suppliers. Demand for biofuels could also increase farm income. Biofuel production and use has drawbacks as well, including land and water resource requirements, air and ground water pollution. Depending on the feedstock and production process, biofuels can emit even more GHGs than some fossil fuels on an energy -equivalent basis. In 2007, Congress enacted the   with the stated goals of “mov[ing] the United states toward greater energy independence and security [and] to increase the production of clean renewable fuels.” In accordance with these goals, EISA revised the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program, which was created under the 2005 Energy Policy Act and is administered by EPA, to increase the volume of renewable fuel required to be blended into transportation fuel to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022.  Section 204 of EISA directs EPA, in consultation with the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Energy, to assess and report triennially to Congress on the environmental and resource conservation impacts of the RFS Program. The reports: The first report to Congress was completed in 2011 and provided an assessment of the environmental and resource conservation impacts associated with increased biofuel production and use (EPA/600/R-10/183F). The overarching conclusions of this first report were: (1) the environmental impacts of increased biofuel production and use were likely negative but limited in impact; (2) there was a potential for both positive and negative impacts in the future; and (3) EISA goals for biofuels production could be achieved with minimal environmental impacts if best practices were used and if technologies advanced to facilitate the use of second-generation biofuel feedstocks (corn stover, perennial grasses, woody biomass, algae, and waste). The second report to Congress was completed in 2018 and reaffirmed the overarching conclusions of the 2011 Report (EPA/600/R-18/195). The 2018 Report noted that the biofuel production and use conditions that led to the conclusions of the 2011 Report had not materially changed, and that the production of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks anticipated by both the EISA and the 2011 Report had not materialized. Noting observed increases in acreage for corn and soybean production in the period prior to and following implementation of the RFS2 Program, the 2018 Report concluded that the environmental and resource conservation impacts associated with land use change were likely due, at least in part, to the RFS and associated production of biofuel feedstocks. EPA, in consultation with USDA and DOE, is currently developing the third report to Congress, which will build on the conclusions of the previous two reports. Opportunities for public engagement will be announced in Federal Register Notices."},

Native American and Tribal populations bear an excessive burden of poor indoor air quality (IAQ) and asthma. The rate of asthma in the Native American and Tribal populations is almost double the national average. Scientific research has found a link between poor IAQ, asthma, and other adverse health effects. It is important to increase awareness among Native American and Tribal populations of the health results of poor IAQ and how to improve IAQ in their homes and communities. The plan is to invite indoor air quality (IAQ) champions working with Tribal communities to share innovative approaches, network with others across the nation, and learn about IAQ information and Tribal-specific materials. The goal is to reduce the percentage of Native American and Tribal populations exposed to indoor environmental pollutants. A recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that asthma affects almost 12 percent of people living in Tribal communities—nearly double the current national average of 7 percent. Managing triggers is especially important for Tribal communities who are disproportionately affected by asthma. Secondhand smoke is a mixture of the smoke given off by the burning end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and the smoke exhaled by smokers. Secondhand smoke is also called environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and exposure to secondhand smoke is sometimes called involuntary or passive smoking. Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of chemicals known to be toxic (poisonous) or carcinogenic (cancer-causing). Although secondhand smoke itself vanishes from sight after a brief period of time, it actually lingers in the air hours after the tobacco has been extinguished. Further, the chemicals in secondhand smoke are absorbed into clothing fabric, drapes, furniture upholstery, and carpeting — leaving dangerous chemicals in the environment long after the smoke vanishes from sight. Traditional and/or ritual use of tobacco is an important cultural component in many Native American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. For many, tobacco is sacred. It is burned for peace or prayer. Smoking traditional tobacco and manufactured tobacco both may result in health problems — heart attack, stroke and lung disease — in the smoker and his or her children, however, manufactured tobacco is generally treated with more chemicals and thus may be more toxic as a result. Nicotine, the addictive component of cigarettes, is found in both traditional and manufactured tobacco. Traditional and ritual tobacco use is different from the habitual abuse developed by addicted smokers. EPA’s Smoke Free Homes and Cars Program aims to reduce children’s exposure to secondhand smoke by asking parents and other caregivers to take a pledge not to smoke inside the home or car. The website has easy to understand information about the health effects of secondhand smoke and materials that can be ordered or downloaded at no cost, including a brochure “Secondhand Tobacco Smoke and the Health of Your Family” is also readily available on the website. Learn about Radon and download Radon materials on  Peter Diethrich, GAP Manager of Environmental Programs of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe. As the leading cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers, radon has become a serious issue for many Tribal communities, including the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of Colorado. Peter Diethrich is the tribe's General Assistance Program — GAP — Manager of Environmental Programs; the goal of the GAP is to assist tribes in developing the capacity to plan and establish environmental protection programs and to develop and implement solid and hazardous waste programs in accordance with their individual needs. Once the Southern Ute Tribe developed an efficient solid waste program, Peter was directed by his EPA grant manager to alter the program to include IAQ with an emphasis on radon. Peter has taken on radon and faced several challenges in terms of testing — mainly due to location. Situated in the Southwest region of Colorado, many Southern Ute families live in remote areas. Use of short-term carbon tests for radon proved to be difficult due to the time-frame necessary to ship to the lab — typically two to three days. Because of the time and distance, many of the test kits would return with invalid results. To mediate this challenge, Peter purchased two continuous radon monitoring devices through GAP funding. These tests generate results on the spot. Once Peter visits a Tribal home, he can use this tool to measure the concentration of radon in the home by the hour. But Peter's job isn't done after he leaves the homes he tests. By posting advertisements in newspapers and e-newsletters, Peter is able to promote radon testing in the tribe. This strategy was especially useful during National Radon Action Month — NRAM — in January. During NRAM, Peter placed ads in the Tribal Housing and Bureau of Indian Affairs newsletters, which prompted an increase in testing. Another effective method is through word of mouth — Tribal members have encouraged their friends and family to test their homes once they understand the importance and ease of testing. This form of outreach has been a great way to increase and spread awareness on the health risk associated with radon. To learn more about Peter's work, contact   at pdieth@southern-utee.nsn.us. For basic information about mold growth in homes and its potential health effects, visit  . Smoke is made up of a complex mixture of gases and fine, microscopic particles produced when wood and other organic matter burn. The biggest health threat from wood smoke comes from fine particles (also called particulate matter). They are small enough to enter the lungs where they can cause bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma, or other serious respiratory diseases. Fine particles can also aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases, and are linked to premature deaths in people with these chronic conditions. Many old, pot-bellied wood stoves are still functioning to provide warmth and a cooking fire in Tribal communities; but they may also be releasing wood smoke that is harmful to the health of everyone exposed to it, especially the young and the old. To avoid these inevitable health risks — and gain the greater efficiency and effectiveness of new, cleaner burning technology wood stoves — it is recommended that old stoves be gradually replaced or “changed out.” Changing out wood stoves requires a financial investment; however, there are programs that provide financial assistance and manufacturers that provide discounts. The results of replacement speak for themselves with improvements in the health of children and community, home safety, visibility, and indoor air quality. EPA certified wood stoves burn more efficiently and cleanly."},

In 1977, Congress amended the   (CAA or Act) to provide for a   (PSD) program.

Areas that are in attainment of the NAAQS are categorized as either “Class I”, “Class II,” or “Class III” which determines the increment of air quality deterioration allowed. Under the PSD program, all international parks, national wilderness areas and national memorial parks that exceed 5,000 acres, and of national parks that exceed 6,000 acres are designated as mandatory federal Class I areas in order to preserve, protect and enhance air quality. All other areas that attain the NAAQS are initially designated as Class II.  Section 164 of the CAA, gives states and tribes the ability to request redesignation from Class II to Class I called “non-federal” Class I areas.  Redesignation is one of the tools available to tribes (and states) under the CAA to afford special protection to air quality.  In August 2013, we released guidance for federally recognized Indian tribes who are considering redesignating the areas within the exterior boundaries of their reservations as Class I areas under the PSD program. This guidance also provides answers to frequently asked questions and an explanation of the redesignation process. \n\t "},
